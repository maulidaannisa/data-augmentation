During the two years , I was on the Lipitor , all these syptoms started out slowly . First came the tinnitus . My Dr sent me to the ear Dr. Found no problem , I would have to live with it . Second , came depression , Dr put me on Zoloft . Then came the sinus problems , Dr put me on Rhinocort . During all this I felt like I was 80 years old . My neck hurt , my hips hurt . We got a $ 3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain . Did n't really help . Insomia was constant . I got hooked on Tylenol PM . I gained a lot of weight .

I 've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem . He said , no . There is no warning on the prescription bottle , to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol .
