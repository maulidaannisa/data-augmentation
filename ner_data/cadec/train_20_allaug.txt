caught	I-Disease
up	I-Disease
with	I-Disease
you	I-Disease
and	O
now	O
you	O
were	O

.	O
I	O
took	O
the	O

for	O
two	O
terrible	O

and	O
then	O
had	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O

my	O

had	O

My	O

mailed	O
me	O
the	O

of	O
my	O

did	O
not	O
send	O
me	O
a	O
new	O
prescription	O
like	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
so	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
refilled	O
.	O
So	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug

within	O
two	O

I	O
was	O
feeling	O

even	O
took	O
a	O

where	O
I	O
walked	O
five	O

a	O

with	O

I	O
did	O

my	O
getting	O

with	O
my	O

off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
,	O
unfortunately	O
.	O
Then	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
appointment	O
with	O
my	O

he	O
said	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
refilled	O
that	O
prescription	O
by	O
calling	O
his	O
office	O

I	O
did	O
and	O
the	O
next	O

,	O
after	O
taking	O
only	O
one	O
pill	O
,	O
I	B-Disease
was	I-Disease
eighty	I-Disease

I	O
did	O

it	O

then	O
read	O
the	O
warnings	O
the	O
drug	O
store	O
gives	O
you	O
with	O

and	O
found	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
were	O
the	O

as	O
what	O
they	O
warned	O
against	O
.	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
hypochondriac	B-Disease

I	O
never	O
read	O
those	O

so	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O

I	O
immediately	O
went	O
off	O
the	O

a	O

I	O

have	O
the	O

do	O

that	O
I	O
will	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
no	O

he	O

also O
had O
been O
experiencing O
lack B-Disease
of I-Disease
energy I-Disease
for O
quite O
some O
time O
and O
I O
attributed O
this O
to O
stress B-Disease
but O
after O
reading O
this O
website O
I O
feel O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
lipitor B-Drug
also O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
will O
take O
this O
drug O
anymore O
and O
since O
I O
read O
that O
taking O
vitamin B-Drug
c I-Drug
can O
help O
you O
with O
your O
cholesterol O
I O
think O
I O
will O
try O
this O
method O
instead O
. O
I O
think O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
to O
lowering O
cholesterol O
than O
such O
a O
potent O
drug O
that O
can O
cause O
so O
many O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
case-study O
when O
they O
finally O
take O
this O
drug O
off O
the O
market O
. O

I O
started O
experiencing O
severe O
leg B-Disease
cramping I-Disease
at O
night O
with O
the O
pain B-Disease
traveling I-Disease
to I-Disease
my I-Disease
buddocks I-Disease
and O
stomach O
as O
well O
. O
The O
pain B-Disease
was O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
had O
to O
crawl O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bathroom O
to O
take O
advil B-Drug
. O
I O
asked O
my O
doctor O
what O
could O
have O
caused O
this O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
from O
the O
lipitor B-Drug
. O
Recently O
I O
experienced O
extreme O
internal B-Disease
organ I-Disease
pain I-Disease
that O
stretched O
to O
my O
side O
and O
back O
. O
The O
stomach B-Disease
pain I-Disease
came O
suddenly O
and O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
for O
a O
week O
before O
it O
became O
so O
bad O
I O
could B-Disease
not I-Disease
sleep I-Disease
. O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
urinery B-Disease
tract I-Disease
ill I-Disease
health I-Disease
( O
one O
of O
the O
side-effects O
) O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
had O
returned O
but O
the O
symptoms O
were O
different O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
urge B-Disease
to I-Disease
urinate I-Disease
constantly O
but O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
and O
I O
would O
have O
no O
symptoms O
for O
a O
day O
then O
it O
would O
return O
again O
. O
I O
remembered O
reading O
the O
phamplet O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
it O
mentioning O
some O
of O
symptoms O
that O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
lipitor B-Drug
for O
a O
day O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
more O
stomach B-Disease
pain I-Disease
or O
urgency B-Disease
. O
I O
also O
had O
been O
experiencing O
lack B-Disease
of I-Disease
energy I-Disease

quite O
some O

What O

the O

There O

28 O

not O
reduced O
by O

RR O
0.98 O
[ O

Thus O
the O

I O
started O

severe O
Leg B-Disease
cramps I-Disease
at O
night O
with O
the O
bladder B-Disease
irritants I-Disease
and O
stomach O
as O
well O
. O
The O
Strong B-Disease
pain I-Disease
was O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
had O
to O
crawl O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bathroom O
to O
take O
Vitamins B-Drug
A I-Drug
. O
I O
asked O
my O
doctor O
what O
could O
have O
caused O
this O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
from O
the O
Lipitors B-Drug
. O
Recently O
I O
experienced O
extreme O
stomach B-Disease
pains I-Disease
that O
stretched O
to O
my O
side O
and O
back O
. O
The O
stomach B-Disease
pains I-Disease
came O
suddenly O
and O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
for O
a O
week O
before O
it O
became O
so O
bad O
I O
can B-Disease
not I-Disease
sleep I-Disease
. O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
urinary B-Disease
tract I-Disease
infection I-Disease
( O
one O
of O
the O
side-effects O
) O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
had O
returned O
but O
the O
symptoms O
were O
different O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
urge B-Disease
to I-Disease
urinate I-Disease
constantly I-Disease
constantly O
but O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
and O
I O
would O
have O
no O
symptoms O
for O
a O
day O
then O
it O
would O
return O
again O
. O
I O
remembered O
reading O
the O
phamplet O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
it O
mentioning O
some O
of O
symptoms O
that O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
Lipitors B-Drug
for O
a O
day O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
more O
stomach B-Disease
pains I-Disease
or O
agitated B-Disease
. O
I O
also O
had O
been O
experiencing O
have B-Disease
no I-Disease
energy I-Disease
for O
quite O
some O
time O
and O
I O
attributed O
this O
to O
stressing B-Disease
but O
after O
reading O
this O
website O
I O
feel O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
Lipitors B-Drug
also O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
will O
take O
this O
drug O
anymore O
and O
since O
I O
read O
that O
taking O
vitamin B-Drug
C I-Drug
crystals I-Drug
can O
help O
you O
with O
your O
cholesterol O
I O
think O
I O
will O
try O
this O
method O
instead O
. O
I O
think O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
to O
lowering O
cholesterol O
than O
such O
a O
potent O
drug O
that O
can O
cause O
so O
many O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
case-study O
when O
they O
finally O
take O
this O
drug O
off O
the O
market O
. O

( O
one O

and O
I O
thought O

the O

I O
still O
had O
the O
frequent B-Disease

I O

I O
stopped O

not O

I O

second O
week O
, O
I O
accidentally O
took O
a O
dose O
in O
the O
morning O
instead O

after O

other O
three O
days O
I O
will O
try O

back O
. O
The O
came O
suddenly O
and O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
for O
a O
week O
before O
it O
became O
so O
bad O
I O
. O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
( O
one O
of O
the O
side-effects O
) O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
had O
returned O
but O
the O
symptoms O
were O
different O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
constantly O
but O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
and O
I O
would O
have O
no O
symptoms O
for O
a O
day O
then O
it O
would O
return O
again O
. O
I O
remembered O
reading O
the O
phamplet O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
it O
mentioning O
some O
of O
symptoms O
that O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
for O
a O
day O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
more O
or O
. O
I O
also O
had O
been O
experiencing O
for O
quite O
some O
time O
and O
I O
attributed O
this O
to O
but O
after O
reading O
this O
website O
I O
feel O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
also O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
will O
take O
this O
drug O
anymore O
and O
since O
I O
read O
that O
taking O
can O
help O
you O
with O
your O
cholesterol O
I O
think O
I O
will O
try O
this O
method O
instead O
. O
I O
think O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
to O
lowering O
cholesterol O
than O
such O
a O
potent O
drug O
that O
can O
cause O
so O
many O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
case-study O
when O
they O
finally O
take O
this O
drug O
off O
the O
market O
