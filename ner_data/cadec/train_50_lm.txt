caught	I-Disease
up	I-Disease
with	I-Disease
you	I-Disease
and	O
now	O
you	O
were	O

.	O
I	O
took	O
the	O

for	O
two	O
terrible	O

and	O
then	O
had	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O

my	O

had	O

My	O

mailed	O
me	O
the	O

of	O
my	O

did	O
not	O
send	O
me	O
a	O
new	O
prescription	O
like	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
so	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
refilled	O
.	O
So	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug

within	O
two	O

I	O
was	O
feeling	O

even	O
took	O
a	O

where	O
I	O
walked	O
five	O

a	O

with	O

I	O
did	O

my	O
getting	O

with	O
my	O

off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
,	O
unfortunately	O
.	O
Then	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
appointment	O
with	O
my	O

he	O
said	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
refilled	O
that	O
prescription	O
by	O
calling	O
his	O
office	O

I	O
did	O
and	O
the	O
next	O

,	O
after	O
taking	O
only	O
one	O
pill	O
,	O
I	B-Disease
was	I-Disease
eighty	I-Disease

I	O
did	O

it	O

then	O
read	O
the	O
warnings	O
the	O
drug	O
store	O
gives	O
you	O
with	O

and	O
found	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
were	O
the	O

as	O
what	O
they	O
warned	O
against	O
.	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
hypochondriac	B-Disease

I	O
never	O
read	O
those	O

so	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O

I	O
immediately	O
went	O
off	O
the	O

a	O

I	O

have	O
the	O

do	O

that	O
I	O
will	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
no	O

he	O

Started O
2 O
years O

with O
10 O
mg O
then O
6 O
mos O
later O
doc O
upped O
to O
20 O
. O
About O
3 O
mos O
ago O
I O
had O
several O
severe O
left O
-never O
had O
them O
before O
. O
Then O
about O
2-3 O
weeks O
later O
, O
woke O
up O
and O
. O
Legs O
and O
toes O
were O
( O
worse O
in O
left O
) O
, O
, O
and O
terribly O
. O
Walking O
was O
possible O
but O
only O
with O
intense O
effort O
and O
. O
Could O
n't O
stand O
for O
more O
than O
1 O
or O
2 O
minutes-too O
and O
. O
Waited O
a O
couple O
3 O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
it O
would O
clear O
up-did O
not O
. O
Went O
to O
doc O
. O
Took O
x-rays O
said O
everything O
fine O
, O
blood O
test O
fine O
. O
Interested O
in O
doing O
MRI-thinking O
nacrotic O
nerve O
in O
lower O
spine O
. O
On O
an O
aside O
he O
said O
stop O
taking O
on O
an O
off O
chanch O
it O
may O
be O
an O
uncommon O
reaction O
. O
I O
started O
looking O
up O
reactions O
and O
came O
across O
so O
much O
info O
on O
side O
effects O
it O
was O
startling O
. O
I O
look O
back O
to O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
years O
ago O
when O
I O
no O
longer O
had O
that O
and O
a O
( O
not O
typical O
for O
me O
) O
. O
At O
the O
time O
I O
attributed O
it O
to O
male O
menopause-being O
around O
54 O
. O
I O
went O
to O
my O
accupuncturist O
and O
was O
told O
my O
chee O
was O
dry O
. O
Had O
4 O
treatments O
over O
as O
many O
weeks O
. O
Started O
to O
see O
some O
improvement O
. O
At O
the O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
would O
imagine O
someone O
that O
had O
would O
feel O
like O
, O
, O
pulling O
myself O
up O
stairs O
, O
. O
After O
having O

I O

I O

to O
my O
cardiologist O

who O
both O
denied O
problems O
were O
related O
to O
Lipitor B-Drug

because O
my O
CPK O
was O
only O
mildly O
elevated O
( O

. O
I O
also O
saw O
a O
podiatrist O

with O
no O
relief O
. O
When O
it O

I O
could O

did O
not O
care O
about O
my O

I O
took O
myself O
off O

got O
a O
50 O

improvement O
after O
one O
week O
. O
I O
then O
saw O
a O
neurologist O
who O
diagnosed O
me O
with O
Myalgia B-Disease
induced I-Disease
by I-Disease
statin I-Disease
. O
He O
said O
he O
sees O
a O
lot O
of O
patients O
with O
Cpk B-Disease
slightly I-Disease
elevated. I-Disease
that O
many O
physicians O
do O
not O
recognized O
as O
a O

I O
have O

does O
not O

felt O
that O
I O

, O
by O
waking O
up O

all I-Disease
that I-Disease
your I-Disease

up I-Disease

now O
you O
were O

. O
I O
took O

did O
not O
send O
me O
a O

time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O

. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O

and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O

I O
walked O
five O

a O

I O
did O
not O

with O
my O
coming O
off O

, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O

and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O

I O
did O
and O
the O

, O
I B-Disease
was I-Disease

I O
was O
put O
on O
this O
drug O
by O
my O
doctor O
for O
my O
somewhat O
High B-Disease
cholesterol, I-Disease
which, I-Disease
. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
after O
starting O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
suddenly O
A.M. B-Disease
felt I-Disease
like I-Disease
i I-Disease
had I-Disease
retired I-Disease
overnight, I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old. I-Disease
but O
did O
not O
connect O
it O
to O
starting O
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O
pill O
can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O
recovering O
like O
I O
did O
the O
first O
time O
. O
This O
has O
ruined O
my O
life O
and O
I O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
if O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
know O
now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O
permanent O
damage O
. O
My O

when O
