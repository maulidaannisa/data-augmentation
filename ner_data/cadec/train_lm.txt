still O
have O
leg O

back B-Disease

I O
did O
this O

Taken O
for O
excruciating O
disc O

shooting O
pains B-Disease
through I-Disease
my I-Disease
hips I-Disease
and O
down O
both O
legs O
. O
Was O
fine O
for O
the O
first O
2 O
days O
, O
did O
n't O
feel O
much O
change O
in O
the O
pain O
but O
started O
feeling O
nauseous B-Disease
all O
the O
time O
which O
makes O
it O
hard O
to O
take O
because O
I O
need O
to O
take O
them O
with O
food O
. O
Havent O
had O
any O
for O
2 O
days O

feel O
sick O
all O
the O
time O
, O
I O
'm O
supposed O
to O
take O
them O
for O
3 O
weeks O
but O
I O
think O
I O
'll O
just O
go O
back O
to O
the O
dr O
and O
ask O
for O
the O
cortisone B-Drug
injection I-Drug
. O

I O
was O
prescribed O
Zipsor B-Drug
for O
bone O
and O
joint B-Disease
pain I-Disease
associated O
with O
Lupus B-Disease
. O
I O
also O
have O
3 O
herniated O
discs O
that O
have O
been O
bothering O
me O
for O
years O
, O
and O
for O
which O
I O
have O
always O
taken O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
Vicodin B-Drug
( O
almost O
daily O
) O
. O
The O
Zipsor B-Drug
works O
well O
on O
the O
Lupus B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
but O
also O
almost O
completely O
wiped O
out O
the O
pain B-Disease
from I-Disease
the I-Disease
herniated I-Disease
discs I-Disease
, O
and O
has O
replaced O
my O
usual O
narcotic O
pain O
relief O
for O
my O
back O
. O
As O
with O
any O
disc B-Disease
issues I-Disease
there O
seems O
to O
be O
the O
occasional O
flare O
up O
, O
but O
when O
they O
do O
occur O
now O
they O
are O
minor O
, O
and O
once O
I O
take O
my O
usual O
dose O
of O
Zipsor B-Drug

the O

Very O
slowly O

The O

as O
it O
spread O
to O
my O

up O
my O

. O
Have O
been O
off O
Lipitor B-Drug
eight O

still O
have O
problems O
. O
From O
what O
I O
read O
I O
fear O
this O
will O
be O
with O
me O
. O
This O
is O
dangerous O
as O
doctors O
are O
handing O
this O
out O
like O
candy O
and O
are O
not O
monitoring O
their O
patients O
closely O
. O
The O
dark O
side O
of O
Statins O
far O
overshadow O
the O
benefits O
. O

even O
after O

after O
reading O
this O

i O
am O
swayed O
to O
think O
that O
it O
is O
a O
degenative B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
problem I-Disease
( O
which O
will O
heal O
in O
time O
due O
to O
1 O

and O
may O
not O
be O
other O

suspected O
. O
. O

initially O

never I-Disease

. O
I O
do O
not O
have O
high B-Disease
blood I-Disease

, O
nor O
have O
I O
ever O
had O
it O
. O
I O
am O
not O
diabetic B-Disease
. O
I O
am O
45 O
and O
a O
half O
years O
old O
and O
was O
on O
20 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
due O
to O
genetically B-Disease
high I-Disease
LDL I-Disease
for O
a O
period O
of O
seven O
months O
. O
At O
that O
point O
, O
I O
started O
having O
terrible B-Disease
, I-Disease
migratory I-Disease
joint I-Disease
pain I-Disease
all I-Disease
over I-Disease
my I-Disease
body I-Disease
that O
was O
very O
distinct O
and O
pronounced O
. O
I O
also O
had O
disabling B-Disease
fatigue I-Disease
and O
flu-like B-Disease
malaise I-Disease
. O
Some O
nights O
I O
would O
go O
to O
bed O
at O
6 O
pm O
and O
not O
get O
up O
until O
8 O
or O
9 O
the O
next O
morning O
. O
I O
was O
quite B-Disease
ill I-Disease
. O
My O
doctor O
did O
tons O
of O
lab O
work O
to O
rule O
out O
things O
like O
rheumatoid B-Disease
arthriitis I-Disease
, O
lupus B-Disease
, O
Lyme B-Disease
disease I-Disease
and O
active B-Disease
parvovirus I-Disease
infection I-Disease
. O
These O
all O
came O
back O
NEGATIVE O
. O
Finally O
, O
I O
was O
taken O
off O
Lipitor B-Drug
to O
see O
if O
the O
drug O
had O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
my O
symptoms O
. O
Within O
72 O
hours O
I O
noted O
an O
improvement O
; O
within O
seven O
days O
, O
the O
symptoms O
were O
completely O
gone O
and O
I O
was O
restored O
to O
health O
. O
I O
will O
not O
ever O
take O
Lipitor B-Drug
again O
as O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
liver-toxic O
and O
slowly O
poisons O
the O
patient O
. O
It O
did O
a O
great O
job O
of O
lowering O
my O
LDL O
( O
173 O
down O
to O
60 O
) O
. O
My O
total O
cholesterol O
went O
from O
238 O
down O
to O
143 O
. O
However O
, O
it O
nearly O
killed O
me O
in O
the O
process O
and O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
almost O
like O
a O
slow-acting O
poison O
. O

Terrific O
cramps O
in O
legs O
and O
awful O
gas B-Disease
pains I-Disease
in I-Disease
abdomen I-Disease
and O
back O
for O
the O
last O
month O
at O
least O
. O
It O
lowered O
my O
LDL O
( O
not O
enough O
) O
but O
also O
lowered O
my O
HDL O
as O
well O
! O
! O
The O
ratio O
is O
not O
good O
! O
. O
I O
started O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
about O
3 O
yrs O
. O
ago O
. O
I O
started O
at O
20. O
then O
my O
Dr O
doubled O
it O
to O
40 O
and O
kept O
wanting O
me O
to O
double O
it O
again O
to O
80 O
. O
After O
me O
telling O
him O
for O
months O
I O
would O
not O
do O
this O
. O
I O
gave O
it O
( O
about O
2 O
months O
ago O
) O
but O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
60 O
rather O
than O
80 O
. O
Well O
, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
after O
taking O
this O
increased O
dosage O
for O
about O
two O
months O
I O
've O
had O
such O
gas B-Disease
pains I-Disease
around I-Disease
my I-Disease
abdomen I-Disease
and O
my O
back O
and O
also O
leg B-Disease
cramps I-Disease
. O
I O
finally O
went O
to O
see O
a O
Dr O
in O
Urgent O
Care O
as O
the O
pain B-Disease
was O
so O
severe O
. O
He O
examined O
me O
and O
could O
not O
find O
any O
swellings O
etc O
and O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
had O
done O
anything O
different O
with O
my O
meds O
. O
I O
told O
him O
I O
had O
increased O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
he O
suggested O
that O
I O
stop O
taking O
it O
ASAP O
. O
I O
only O
stopped O
taking O
it O
last O
night O
and O
I O
am O
anticipating O
that O
I O
will O
feel O
better O
( O
I O
like O
to O
be O
physical O
and O
do O
lots O
of O
walking O
) O
. O
I O
tried O
Crestor O
a O
little O
while O
ago O
and O
ended O
up O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Dept O
. O
of O
a O
hospital O
here O
with O
heart O
palipations O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
really O
very O
confident O
in O
these O
STATINS O
! O
! O
! O
I O
honestly O
feel O
they O
are O
dangerous O
and O
am O
going O
to O
try O
a O
natural O
product O
in O
the O
future O
. O
Thank O
God O
for O
a O
Dr O
that O
finally O
told O
me O
to O
STOP O
! O

The O
clinical O
trials O
for O
FDA O
approval O
were O
n't O
nearly O
long O
enough O

We O
're O
in O
the O
REAL O
clinical O
trials O
now O
, O
while O
lining O
the O

of O
the O
pharmaceutical O
companies O
. O
I O
take O
grape O
juice O
and O
cider O
vinegar O
now O
- O
it O
reduces O

with O
no O

. O

Did O
n't O
have O
much O
pain B-Disease
relief O
, O
and O
within O
a O
few O
days O
of O
starting O
the O
meds O
I O
began O
having O

heavy O

after O
3 O
months O
. O
I O
stopped O

it O
and O
they O
went O
away O
. O
The O
doctor O
switched O
me O
to O

the O

came O
right O
back O

I O
will O
never O

even O
though O
I O

. O
My O

I O
think O
some O
of O

rather O
than O
from O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug

I O
had O

doubted O
it O
would O
be O
the O
lipitor B-Drug
. O
Stopped O
lipitor B-Drug

symptems O
went O
away O
. O
Restarted O

at O
5 O

Will O

A O

Lipitor B-Drug

, O
had O
difficulties B-Disease

tinnitus I-Disease
and O
memory O
. O
The O
problems O
appeared O
little O
by O
little O
over O
the O
years O
. O
The O
best O
thing O
you O
can O
do O
for O
yourself O
and O
others O
is O
to O
educate O
yourself O
on O
this O
- O
and O
other O
medical O
issues O
. O
Read O
books O

read O
patient O

look O
at O
The O
Lipitor B-Drug

At O
about O
the O
same O
time O
as O
I O
started O
taking O
lipitor B-Drug
I O
began O
experiencing O
chest B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
soreness I-Disease
and O
spazms O
which O
have O
persisted O
. O
I O
now O
take O
neurontin B-Drug
, O
an O
anti-seizure O
drug O
together O
with O
pain O
killers O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
muscle B-Disease
problems I-Disease
. O
I O
have O
had O
three O
blood O
tests O
over O
time O
which O
indicate O
that O
the O
lipitor B-Drug
is O
not O
damaging O
the O
muscles O
. O
I O
remain O
suspicious O
that O
lipitor B-Drug
is O
contributing O
to O
my O
muscle B-Disease
problems I-Disease
( O
physiotherpist O
say O
there O
is O
other O
causes O
) O
but O
there O
is O
no O
denying O
that O
my O
cholesterol O
levels O
have O
been O
improved O
( O
they O
never O
were O
that O
bad O
) O
. O

the O
muscle O
spasms O
in O
my O
legs O
were O
so O
bad O
I O
had O
difficulty O
climbing O
4 O
stairs O
- O
highly O
unusual O
for O
me O
. O
you O
need O
to O
keep O
on O
top O
of O
these O
drugs O
because O
the O
dr. O
does O
n't O
always O
monitor O
enough O
. O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
known O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
me O
if O
I O
had O
n't O
seen O
an O
ad O
on O
t.v O
. O
for O
this O
med O
. O
describing O
side O
effects O
. O
Dr O
said O
it O
was O
vitamin B-Drug
C I-Drug
deficiency O
. O
I O
stopped O
the O
lipitol B-Drug
and O
the O
symptoms O
went O
away O
. O
I O
would O
have O
believed O
the O
dr. O
if O
it O
were O
n't O
for O
a O
kind O
pharmacist O
who O
said O
I O
should O
get O
a O
second O

Makes O
me O

silly B-Disease
, O
sleepy B-Disease

No O

Nothing O

Works O
wonderful O
as O
a O

I O
still O
have O
the O
pain B-Disease
, O
I O
believe O
my O
Dr O
has O
misdiagnosed O
me O
. O

I O
've O
been O
taking O
20 O
mg O
. O
lipitor B-Drug
daily O
since O
1989 O
or O
1990. O
no O
side O
effects O
to O
date O
and O
I O
have O
liver O
functions O
tests O
every O
six O
months O
. O
I O
tried O
other O
statins O
before O
lipitor B-Drug
, O
but O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
affect O
lipitor B-Drug
did O
. O

After O
taking O
40 O
mg/day O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
, O
I O
started O
to O
notice O
foot B-Disease

diagnosed O
as O
a O

in I-Disease
the I-Disease
right I-Disease
foot I-Disease
, O
then O
a O

then O
left B-Disease

I O
did O
n't O
connect O
this O
with O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
continued O
to O
take O
it O
. O
I O
saw O
a O
podiatrist O
who O
made O
no O
mention O
of O
the O
connection O
between O
foot B-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
statins O
. O
One O
day O
a O
pharmacist O
told O
my O
husband O
that O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
connection O
between O
taking O
statins O
and O
foot B-Disease

some O
daily O

My O

I O
initially O
could O
n't O
tell O
I O
was O
taking O
it O
. O
About O
two O
years O
ago O
I O
started O
waking O
up O
with O
significant O
congestion B-Disease
with I-Disease
clear I-Disease
phlem I-Disease
. O
Chest O
xray O
was O
clear O

My O
doctor O
suspected O

. O
Having O
2 O
pets O
that O
seemed O
reasonable O
. O
About O
a O
year O
ago O
my O
elbows B-Disease
would I-Disease
burn I-Disease
like I-Disease
fire I-Disease
at O
times O
when O
I O
rested O
my O
arms O
on O
a O
surface O
. O
This O
would O
come O
and O
go O
. O
I O
also O
began O
having O
trouble B-Disease
focusing I-Disease
while I-Disease
reading I-Disease
and O
would O
skip O
around O
. O
Two O
months O
ago O
my O
right B-Disease
heel I-Disease
became I-Disease
painful I-Disease
for O
no O
reason O
. O
The O
more O
I O
walked O
on O
it O
the O
worse O
it O
felt O
. O
I O
switched O
shoes O
with O
no O
change O
. O
It O
hurt O
enough O
that O
I O
began O
to O
worry O
I O
might O
end O
up O
on O
disability O
if O
it O
got O
much O
worse O
. O
I O
was O
recently O
out O
of O
state O
for O
two O
weeks O
and O
still O
had O
congestion B-Disease
in O
spite O
of O
being O
in O
a O
totally O
different O
environment O
. O
That O
was O
when O
I O
suspected O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
did O
some O
research O
on O
line O
and O
saw O
matches O
with O
all O
of O
my O
symptoms O
. O
I O
immediately O
stopped O
it O
and O
the O
next O
morning O
the O
congestion B-Disease
was O
80 O
% O
less O
. O
I O
saw O
my O
doctor O
who O
agreed O
I O
need O
to O
stop O
it O
. O
He O
explained O
that O
there O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
side O
affects O
and O
there O
is O
no O
way O
to O
predict O
who O
will O
get O
which O
ones O
or O
when O
they O
will O
develop O
. O
The O
blood O
tests O
give O
a O
false O
sense O
of O
security O
since O
the O
results O
( O
like O
mine O
) O
can O
be O
normal O

other O
serious O

can O
develop O

HORRIBLE B-Disease
GAS I-Disease

CONSTIPATION B-Disease

My O
trigycerides O
and O
cholesterol O
were O
all O
normal O
and O
healhty O
ranges O
, O
before O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug

But O
because O
of O
a O
high B-Disease
C-reactive I-Disease
protein I-Disease
level I-Disease
, O
I O
was O
prescribed O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
After O
3 O

, O
My O

and O
total O
cholesteral O
went O
down O
, O
even O

went O
UP O

! O
! O
From O
5.96 O

! O
Since O
treating O
the O

the O
initial O
purpose O
in O

me O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
and O
since O
it O
did O
NOTHING O
to O
help O
these O
levels O
, O
I O
am O
therefore O
unsure O
if O
taking O
LIPITOR B-Drug
for O
high O
C-reactive O
protein O
levels O
is O
necessary O
, O
let O
alone O
effective O
. O
I O

much O
longer O

I O
've O

only O
after O
15 O
months O
the O
muscle O

started O
- O
particularly O
in O
the O
glutes O

I O
've O
also O
had O

but O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
could O
be O
the O
cause O
. O
Also O
a O
hard O
to O
describe O
feeling O
like O
a O
very O
inner O
mild B-Disease
panic I-Disease
attack I-Disease

only O
lasts O
a O

Abdominal B-Disease
rash I-Disease
for O
the O
last O
6 O

I O
thought O
it O
was O
shingles B-Disease
but O
the O
doctor O
said O
no O
and O
prescribed O
an O
ointment O
. O
I O
have O
had O
high O
blood O
pressure O
for O
the O
last O
three O
months O
too O
but O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
Lipitor B-Drug
could O
be O
the O
cause O
. O

started O
having O
muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
in O
upper O
right O

then O

etc O
. O
unable B-Disease
to I-Disease

the O
worst O
is O
being O
unable B-Disease
to I-Disease

. O
These O
symptoms O
have O
developed O
over O
the O
years O

Have O
only O
just O
come O
off O

the O
symptoms O
will O
improve O

I O
have O
vaginal O
bleeding O

. O
. O
. O
it O
's O
taken O
me O
almost O
a O
week O
to O
realize O
this O
bleeding O
is O
due O
to O
the O
medication O
. O
The O
bleeding O
started O
almost O
immediately O
after O
taking O
the O
first O
dose O
. O
I O
initially O
thought O
I O
was O
having O
my O
period O
( O
even O
though O
it O
was O
not O
time O
) O
. O
If O
anyone O
can O
give O

how O
long O
this O
bleeding O

lasts O

about O
the O

she O
insisted O
that O
I O
needed O
to O
take O
it O

would O

out O

my O

After O
about O
10 O

I O
suddenly O

sporatic O
from O

to O
calf O
to O

then O
back O

it O
did O

I O
had O
n't O
done O
anything O
out O
of O
the O
ordinary O
to O
be O
feeling O
this O

the O
Toprol B-Drug
at O
first O
due O
to O
low B-Disease
bp I-Disease
and I-Disease
pulse I-Disease
also O
. O
So O
started O
back O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
within O
a O
week O
felt O
horrible O
again O
. O
Stopped O
it O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
will O
NOT O
go O
back O
on O
it O
. O

Muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
which O
I O
thought O
was O
Arthritis B-Disease
. O

back B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
aching B-Disease
joints I-Disease
and O
muscles O
, O
flatulence B-Disease
and O
wind B-Disease

. O

My O
doctor O
switched O
me O
from O
Pravachol B-Drug
to O
Lipitor B-Drug
almost O
a O
year O
ago O
because O
of O
a O
study O
that O
was O
done O
in O
CHF O
patients O
and O
when O
Lipitor B-Drug
was O
used O
, O
hospitalizations O
were O
cut O
almost O
in O
half O
. O
Normally O
I O
have O
to O
go O
into O
the O
hospital O
a O
minimum O
of O
2 O
times O
a O
year O
. O
Since O
I O
started O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
I O
have O
not O
been O
in O
the O
hospital O
even O
once O
! O
Also O
, O
he O
also O
told O
me O
that O
Lipitor B-Drug
was O
better O
for O
my O
kidneys O
than O
the O
statins O
. O

heavy B-Disease
aching I-Disease
legs I-Disease
, O
especially O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
Never O
considered O
it O
a O
side O
effect O
before O
reading O
about O
it O
. O
Certainly O
nothing O
I O
ca O
n't O
live O
with O
unless O
it O
worsens O
and O
after O
10 O
yrs O
I O
doubt O
that O
will O
happen O
. O
4 O
yrs O
on O
zocor B-Drug
then O
6 O
on O
lipitor B-Drug
( O
40mg O
) O
. O
Cholestrol O
went O
from O
300 O
to O
200 O
. O

No O
side O
affects O
. O
This O
pill O
works O
like O
magic O
to O
releive O
my O
arthritic B-Disease
pain I-Disease
! O
I O
do O
n't O
take O
it O
regularly O
, O
only O
when O
required O
- O
approximately O
once O
per O
month O
. O

For O
about O
15 O
months O
I O
experienced O
SEVERE B-Disease
fatigue I-Disease
, O
and O
initially O
for O
about O
three O
months O
very O
bad O
headaches O
which O
diminished O
in O
intensity O
but O
never O
completely O
went O
away O
. O
Insomnia B-Disease
, O
I O
would O
wake O
up O
at O
3:00 O
am O
and O
be O
unable O
to O
go O
back O
to O
sleep O
. O
Difficulty B-Disease
in I-Disease
swallowing I-Disease
and O
constipation B-Disease
. O
I O
went O
to O
3 O
different O
doctors O
for O
these O
symptoms O
. O
All O
of O
them O
dismissed O
my O
view O
that O
maybe O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
was O
causing O
all O
of O
this O
even O
though O
the O
symptoms O
started O
about O
3 O
weeks O
after O
uping O
the O
dosage O
from O
20 O
mg. O
to O
40 O
. O
I O
quit O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
about O
a O
week O
ago O
- O
thanks O
in O
part O
to O
this O
web O
site O
. O
Within O
3 O
days O
I O
was O
no O
longer O
consistently O
waking O
up O
at O
3:00 O
am O
unable O
to O
go O
back O
to O
sleep O
. O
Headaches B-Disease
seem O
to O
be O
dissipating O
as O
well O
, O
and O
the O
extreme B-Disease
fatigue I-Disease
is O
disappearing O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
expect O
MD O
's O
to O
be O
knowledgeable O
about O
every O
drug O
and O
I O
recognize O
that O
this O
drug O
has O
probably O
saved O
a O
lot O
of O
lives O
, O
but O
it O
is O
the O
attitude O
that O
I O
find O
irresponsible O
, O
that O
these O
problems O
could O
n't O
possibly O
be O
caused O
by O
Lipitor B-Drug
since O
as O
all O
the O
doctors O
said O
. O

gas B-Disease
, O
constipation O
. O

I O
was O
experiencing O
lower B-Disease
back I-Disease
pain I-Disease
& O
noticed O
my O
spouse O
had O
some O
arthrotec B-Drug
50mg O
anti O
inflammatory O
pills O
left O
. O
So O
i O
read O
about O
it O
online O
then O
decided O
to O
take O
one O
. O
Then O
about O
20mins O
later O
i O
had O
MAJOR B-Disease
menstrual I-Disease
cramps I-Disease
& O
started O
bleeding B-Disease
. O
i O
had O
rlly O
bad O
sickness B-Disease
& O
ended O
up O
puking B-Disease
. O
. O
thank O
god O
i O
got O
the O
pill O
out O
my O
system O
, O
the O
pain B-Disease
stopped O
10mins O
later O
but O
i O
am O
still O
menstrating B-Disease
. O
This O
drug O
cant O
be O
good O
for O
you O
if O
it O
brought B-Disease
my I-Disease
period I-Disease
on I-Disease
when O
ive O
only O
just O
finished O
my O
last O
cycle O
10 O
dyas O
prior O
to O
taking O
the O
drug O
! O
I O
would O
not O
reccomend O
taking O
this O
drug O
if O
it O
hasnt O
been O
suggested O
by O
your O
physician O
. O
I O
wont O
be O
making O
that O
mistake O
again O
! O
. O

Muscle B-Disease

, O
extreme O

. O
In O
horrible O
pain B-Disease
, O
I O
quit O
taking O
it O
and O
replaced O
it O
with O
natural O
therapies O
. O
Starting O
to O
feel O
better O
. O
I O
hope O
and O
pray O
the O
damage O
is O
n't O
permanent O
. O
This O
medication O
is O
nothing O
but O
a O
pharmaceutical O
money O
maker O
. O
It O
should O
be O
banned O
! O
! O
I O
wish O
I O
would O
have O
known O
the O
side O
effects O
when O
I O
started O
taking O
it O
, O
instead O
of O
dealing O
with O
extreme B-Disease
pain I-Disease
for O
so O
many O
years O
! O
. O

On O
lipitor O
for O
4 O
years O
. O
Reduced O
cholesterol O
levels O
to O
normal O
BUT O
since O
taking O
lipitor B-Drug
I O
've O
developed O
horrible B-Disease
pain I-Disease
in I-Disease
both I-Disease
shoulders I-Disease
and O
left O
knee O
. O
Sleeping O
has O
become O
extemely O
difficult O
due O
to O
pain O
. O
Have O
to O
sleep O
in O
a O
chair O
most O
nights O
. O
Orthopedist O
seems O
to O
think O
its O
normal O
aging O
( O
I O
'm O
only O
55 O
) O
and O
internist O
is O
skeptical O
that O
lipitor B-Drug
is O
the O
culprit O
. O
I O
have O
also O
noticed O
that O
I O
have O
short B-Disease
term I-Disease
memory I-Disease
loss I-Disease
and O
am O
easily B-Disease
fatigued I-Disease
. O
After O
reading O
the O
entries O
on O
this O
site O
I O
'm O
stopping O
the O
lipitor B-Drug
today O
and O
we O
'll O
see O
the O
result O
. O

I O
have O
been O
taken O
for O
approximately O
4 O
yrs O
. O
I O
have O
some O
difficulty B-Disease
with I-Disease
digestive I-Disease
system I-Disease
and O
some O
muscle O
pain O
and O
joint B-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O
Lipitor B-Drug
did O
the O
job O
on O
my O
cholesterol O
both O
LDL O
and O
HDL O
. O
I O
have O
quit O
taken O
recently O
to O
see O
if O
it O
affects O
above O
problems O
. O
It O
probably O
is O
a O
trade O
off O
. O
I O
feel O
that O
the O
drug O
is O
too O
expensive O
. O
I O
do O
think O
that O
it O
will O
do O
what O
it O
is O
used O
for O
, O
but O
I O
think O
your O
body O
pays O
a O
price O
. O
Again O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
trade O
off O
. O

Pain B-Disease

for O
years O
, O
told O
it O
was O

in I-Disease
my I-Disease

. O
After O
reading O

on O
the O
internet O
I O
stopped O
it O
a O
month O
ago O
and O
its O
about O
50 O
% O
better O
already O
. O
muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
side O
effects O
seem O
much O
more O
common O
than O
realized O
by O
doctors O
or O
admitted O
by O
the O
company O

. O
I O
was O
not O
informed O
by O
my O
doctor O
to O
look O
out O
for O
these O
symptoms O
, O
in O
fact O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
they O
were O
connected O
to O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
I O
know O
my O
body O
and O
this O
is O
not O
me O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
stop O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

works O
fine O
, O
but O
Pfizer O
is O
now O
screwing O
the O
American O
public O
by O
denying O
access O
to O
the O
drug O
through O
legitimate O
Candian O
pharmacies O
. O
Therefore O
, O
I O
'm O
switching O
to O
Zocor B-Drug
. O

I O
had O
a O
chronic O
backache O
that O
kept O
getting O
worse O
. O
I O
complained O
about O
this O
for O
some O
time O
finally O
a O
doctor O
scheduled O
me O
for O
a O
MRI O
. O
The O
results O
indicated O
I O
have O
arthritis B-Disease
so O
I O
accepted O
that O
and O
attributed O
the O
aches O
to O
simply O
getting O
old O
, O
( O
69 O
yrs O
) O
. O
Two O
weeks O
ago O
it O
got O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
stopped O
my O
regular O
exercise O
. O
About O
a O
week O
ago O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
after O
taking O
my O
usual O
Lipitor B-Drug
dose O
, O
while O
making O
my O
nightly O
trip O
to O
the O
toilet O
, O
a O
severe B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
back I-Disease
cramp I-Disease
almost O
sent O
me O
to O
the O
floor O
. O
After O
finishing O
my O
business O
, O
I O
hardly O
could O
sleep O
that O
night O
. O
As O
I O
got O
out O
of O
bed O
that O
morning O
I O
started O
getting O
severe B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
spasms I-Disease
in O
the O
same O
old O
place O
. O
The O
spasms B-Disease
lasted O
most O
of O
the O
day O
and O
gradually O
the O
intensity O
, O
frequency O
and O
duration O
diminished O
. O
Since O
I O
had O
done O
nothing O
recently O
to O
cause O
a O
cramp B-Disease
or O
spasm B-Disease
, O
and O
realizing O
that O
in O
the O
past O
, O
the O
back B-Disease
aches I-Disease
usually O
were O
the O
worst O
in O
the O
morning O
but O
got O
better O
during O
the O
day O
and O
best O
at O
night O
just O
before O
my O
Lipitor B-Drug
dose O
, O
I O
suspected O
Lipitor B-Drug

I O

I O
kept O
telling O
my O

about O
the O
body B-Disease

he O
always O
blamed O
it O
on O
something O

Also O
much B-Disease
fatigue I-Disease
then O
- O
and O
now O
. O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
STATINS O
- O
and O
if O
you O
do O
I O
hear O
the O
CQ10 B-Drug
is O
a O
good O
protector O
for O
some O
of O
the O
muscle O
damage O
that O
the O
statins O
can O
cause O
. O
Too O
late O
for O
me O
, O
I O
think O
, O
as O
the O
damage O
is O
done O
and O
permanent O
. O

muscle B-Disease
weariness I-Disease
in I-Disease
legs I-Disease
, O
especially O
after O
waking O
up O

Soreness O
in O
right O

. O
Have O
generally O
been O
fit O
and O
healthy O
and O
at O
58 O
feel O
physically O
older O
than O
I O
feel O
I O
should O
. O
Have O
been O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
10 O
months O
but O
on O
other O
lipids O
previously O
for O
10 O
years O
. O
Am O
definitely O
thinking O
of O
going O
off O
lipids O
since O
doing O
some O
research O
. O
People O
over O
60 O
with O
high O
cholesterol O
live O
longer O
than O
people O
over O
60 O
with O
low O
cholesterol O
! O
. O

I O
feel O
a O
bit O
drowsy O
& O
have O
a O
little B-Disease
blurred I-Disease
vision I-Disease
, O
so O
far O
no O
gastric B-Disease
problems I-Disease
. O
I O
've O
been O
on O
Arthrotec O
50 O
for O
over O
10 O
years O
on O
and O
off O
, O
only O
taking O
it O
when O
I O
needed O
it O
. O
Due O
to O
my O
arthritis B-Disease
getting O
progressively O
worse O
, O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
am O
in O
tears O
with O
the O
agony B-Disease
, O
gp O
's O
started O
me O
on O
75 O
twice O
a O
day O
and O
I O
have O
to O
take O
it O
. O
every O
day O
for O
the O
next O
month O
to O
see O
how O
I O
get O
on O
, O
here O
goes O
. O
So O
far O
its O
been O
very O
good O
, O
pains B-Disease
almost O
gone O
, O
but O
I O
feel B-Disease
a I-Disease
bit I-Disease
weird I-Disease
, O
did O
n't O
have O
that O
when O
on O
50 O
. O

After O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
a O
number O
of O
years O
my O
muscles O
and O
joints O
in O
my O
legs O
and O
shoulders O
gradually O
became O
very O
painful O
. O
My O
arms O
are O
so O
weak O
I O
can O
hardly O
lift O
them O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
drug O
for O
about O
a O
month O
. O
Symptoms O
have O
decreased O
but O
I O
am O
worried O
I O
have O
caused O
permanent O
damage B-Disease
to I-Disease
my I-Disease
shoulder I-Disease
joints I-Disease
. O
I O
also O
can B-Disease
not I-Disease
concentrate I-Disease
like O
I O
used O
to O
I O
get B-Disease
tired I-Disease
vry I-Disease
easily I-Disease
. O
Lipitor B-Drug
reduced O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
the O
side O
effects O
are O
too O
great O
. O

fuzzy B-Disease
vision I-Disease
, O
bad O
because O
I O
only O
have O
vision O
in O
one O
eye O
. O
A O
month O
after O
quiting O
, O
it O
has O
NOT O
gone O
away O
. O
migraine B-Disease
almost O
daily O
, O
tintinitus B-Disease
, O
. O
Since O
I O
found O
later O
that O
vision B-Disease
problems I-Disease
were O
listed O
as O
a O
side O
effect O
, O
I O
have O
great O
concern O
that O
my O
doctor O
, O
who O
was O
aware O
of O
my O
vision B-Disease
problems I-Disease
, O
prescribed O
this O
drug O
. O

Severe O
muscle O
and O
joint B-Disease
pain I-Disease
in O
left O
leg O
. O
My O
cardiologist O
started O
with O
a O
dosage O
of O
80 O
mg O
which O
seems O
very O
high O
. O
Symptoms O
started O
after O
second O
dose O
. O
After O
third O
dose O
pain B-Disease
was O
so O
severe O
I O
could B-Disease
hardly I-Disease
move I-Disease
. O
I O
stopped O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
The O
doctor O
recommended O
laying O
off O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
a O
week O
and O
then O
restarting O
. O
NO O
WAY O
! O
The O
pain B-Disease
has O
gradually O
subsided O
but O
it O
has O
not O
disappeared O
over O
a O
period O
of O
several O
months O
. O
This O
stuff O
is O
poison O
. O
I O
would O
rather O
take O
my O
chances O
of O
a O
heart B-Disease
attack I-Disease
than O
live O
with O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
I O
experienced O
weight B-Disease
gain I-Disease
because O
my O
level O
of O
activity O
has O
dropped O
. O

serious O
hands O
& O
feet O
cramping O
, O
weakness B-Disease
, O
painful B-Disease
inflamation I-Disease
of I-Disease
joints I-Disease
/knuckles O
and O
significant O
strength O

. O
persistent B-Disease
feeling I-Disease
of I-Disease
tiredness I-Disease
and O
overall B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
soreness I-Disease
/ O
weakness B-Disease
/ O
fatigue B-Disease
. O
All O
symptoms O
worse O
upon O
waking O
. O
I O
significanlty O
lowered O
my O
chol O
by O
using O
10mg O
lipitor B-Drug
and O
excercising O
. O
However O
, O
for O
months O
I O
attributed O
all O
my O
pains B-Disease
to O
my O
busy O
schedule O
and O
my O
exercise O
routine O
. O
I O
went O
from O
a O
36 O
year-old O
who O
can O
do O
60 O
min O
of O
cardio/45 O
min O
of O
free O
weights O
every O
other O
day O
, O
to O
someone O
who O
can O
barely O
pick O
up O
his O
15 O
mo O
. O
son O
. O
My O
life O
right O
now O
is O
a O
disaster O
. O
I O
've O
been O
off O
it O
2 O
weeks O
and O
the O
pain B-Disease
has O
only O
subsided O
20 O
% O
. O
I O
can O
barely B-Disease
walk I-Disease
when O
I O
wake O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
I O
can O
not O
get O
anything O
done O
around O
the O
house O
. O
My O
life O
right O
now O
is O
depressing O
until O
I O
get O
back O
to O
normal O
. O
All O
exercise O
has O
ceased O
and O
my O
wife O
picks O
up O
the O
slack O
for O
chores O
around O
the O
house O
that O
I O
can O
not O
do O
. O
I O
HAVE O
NEVER O
experienced O
symptoms O
like O
these O
in O
my O
life O
. O
I O
am O
hoping O
this O
goes O
away O
soon O
and O
does O
n't O
cause O
any O
long O
term O
damage O
. O
I O
can O
not O
say O
that O
I O
'd O
do O
it O
over O
again O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
at O
my O
risk O
, O
I O
doubt O
I O
'll O
take O
any O
meds O
willingly O
if O
I O
can O
. O
Drug O
companies O
really O
downplay O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
know O
how O
this O
goes O
, O
I O
work O
with O
stats O
too O
! O
. O

always B-Disease
feeling I-Disease
tired I-Disease
. O
high O
priced O
. O

After O
only O
3 O
weeks O
on O
10 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
I O
called O
my O
Dr O
to O
discontinue O
. O
I O
have O
recently O
begun O
a O
workout O
regimine O
6 O
days O
a O
week O
doing O
elliptical O
training O
and O
weight O
training O
. O
After O
workouts O
I O
would O
be O
so O
tired O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
was O
going O
to O
bed O
at O
8pm O
( O
I O
'm O
normally O
a O
night-owl O
) O
. O
I O
was O
mostly O
feeling O
drained B-Disease
and I-Disease
tired I-Disease
which O
was O
unusual O
for O
me O
and O
did O
n't O
feel O
that O
way O
previous O
to O
taking O
the O
drug O
. O
I O
have O
also O
experienced O
tingling B-Disease
or O
a O
sense O
of O
my O
hand B-Disease
being I-Disease
asleep I-Disease
( O
example O
: O
if O
you O
lay O
on O
it O
wrong O
and O
it O
's O
numb-like B-Disease
) O
. O
I O
have O
only O
been O
off O
one O
day O
. O
but O
have O
already O
slept O
better O
than O
I O
had O
in O
the O
3 O
wks O
on O
it O
. O
Do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
worked O
to O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
since O
I O
was O
n't O
on O
it O
for O
the O
6 O
wks O
to O
do O
the O
bloodwork O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
to O
lower O
it O
naturally O
through O
exercise O
and O
diet O
instead O
of O
the O
drug O
. O
not O
sure O
it O
's O
worth O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
Stay O
in O
tune O
with O
your O
body O
. O
I O
elected O
to O
discontinue O
immediately O
with O
onset O
of O
side O
effects O
. O
Will O
consider O
other O
alternatives O
. O

Fatigue B-Disease
, O
very O
tired O
after O
working O
hours O
( O
and O
I O
'm O
not O
doing O
much O
phisical O
work O
) O
. O
Also O
rush O
all O
over O
my O
face O
. O
It O
helps O
lower O
the O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
's O
not O
worth O
. O

this O
was O
the O
last O
shot O
at O
using O
a O
statin O
to O
reduce O
cholesterol O
ldl O
. O
I O
have O
tried O
all O
the O
statin O
drugs O
, O
you O
know O
the O
very O
expensive O
drug O
of O
choice O
for O
all O
the O
doc O
's O
out O
there O
. O
For O
all O
of O
you O
who O
now O
have O
extremely O
low O
LDL O
and O
a O
bad O
case O
of O
joint O
pain O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
it O
is O
very O
arthritic O
or O
having O
bad O
muscle B-Disease
cramps I-Disease
that O
you O
never O
got O
prior O
to O
the O
drug O
, O
it O
is O
from O
the O
statins O
. O
The O
drug O
is O
able O
to O
decrease O
LDL O
through O
a O
mechanism O
which O
also O
destroys O
and O
depletes O
your O
bodies O
ability O
to O
make O
CoQ10 O
. O
This O
is O
necessary O
for O
they O
health O
of O
muscles O
and O
joints O
( O
that O
's O
why O
you O
are O
experiencing O
the O
joint B-Disease
pains I-Disease
and O
numbness B-Disease
) O
. O
Remember O
your O
heart O
is O
a O
muscle O
, O
guess O
what O
is O
happening O
to O
it O
with O
the O
depletion O
of O
the O
CoQ10 O
? O
? O
? O
If O
you O
do O
some O
research O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
all O
these O
statins O
make O
no O
claims/nor O
have O
studies O
shown O
them O
to O
reduce O
heart B-Disease
attacks I-Disease
, O
but O
they O
cause O
muscle B-Disease
problems I-Disease
i.e O
. O
your O
heart O
, O
this O
is O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
put O
younger O
and O
younger O
people O
on O
these O
drugs O
and O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
that O
you O
do O
your O
own O
research O
versus O
just O
listening O
to O
the O
doctor O
who O
wants O
your O
LDL O
down O
to O
like O
below O
130 O
, O
neurosurgeons O
, O
who O
have O
studied O
this O
would O
tell O
you O
not O
to O
get O
it O
all O
too O
low O
. O
And O
just O
because O
your O
test O
come O
back O
and O
show O
your O
liver O
functions O
are O
fine O
and O
do O
n't O
show O
any O
broken O
down O
muscle O
toxins O
in O
the O
blood O
does O
n't O
mean O
the O
lack O
of O
CoQ10 O
is O
n't O
breaking O
down O
and O
damaging B-Disease
your I-Disease
muscles I-Disease
very O
slowly O
. O
Mine O
always O
showed O
fine O
and O
I O
had O
severe B-Disease
arthritis I-Disease
symptoms I-Disease
in I-Disease
knees I-Disease
and O
hip O
joints O
( O
never O
had O
this O
in O
my O
life O
before O
statins O
) O
and O
bad O
muscle B-Disease
cramps I-Disease
( O
also O
never O
got O
those O
until O
statins O
) O
. O
Granted O
is O
you O
have O
high O
blood O
pressure O
, O
high B-Disease
LDL I-Disease
, O
over B-Disease
weight I-Disease
and O
maybe O
smoke O
, O
then O
you O
probably O
need O
something O
to O
lower O
the O
LDL O
, O
if O
you O
only O
have O
high O
LDL O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
. O
Read O
the O
drug O
company O
studies O
, O
they O
even O
say O
it O
may O
help O
prevent O
a O
heart B-Disease
attack I-Disease
when O
you O
have O
3 O
of O
the O
aforementioned O
risk O
factors O
. O

After O
3 O
doses O
of O
this O
med O
over O
24 O
hour O
period O
, O
my O
pain B-Disease
was O
better O
; O
however O
, O
I O
experienced O
severe O
stomach O
cramping O
and O
diarrhea B-Disease
. O
IBS B-Disease
, O
which O
had O
been O
under O
control O
, O
seems O
to O
have O
returned O
with O
a O
vengeance O
! O
. O

Very B-Disease
Painful I-Disease

for O
past O
3 O

walk I-Disease
without O
higher O

. O
I O
stopped O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
a O
few O
days O
before O
now O
and O
the O
pain O
did O
not O
subside O
. O
I O
now O
know O
from O
this O
site O
that O
it O
takes O
longer O
to O
recover O
then O
a O
few O
days O
. O
This O
has O
caused O
me O
to O
miss O
out O
on O
my O
Summer O
Vacation O
with O
Family O
. O

Stomach B-Disease
cramps I-Disease
, O
diarrhea B-Disease

a O
severe B-Disease
sudden I-Disease

in I-Disease
the I-Disease

3 O
weeks O
after O

the O
medicine O
. O
I O
only O
took O

7 O
days O
, O
and O
it O
caused O
this O
much O
problems O
. O
Never O
again O
, O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
to O
use O
. O
I O
have O
had O
2 O
trips O

since O
this O
happened O
and O
a O

to O
the O

3 O
more O
days O

I O

Muscle B-Disease
weakness I-Disease
in O
arms O
and O

, O
but O
worst O
of O
all O
, O
burning B-Disease
feet I-Disease
and O
painful O
heels O
. O
Taking O
the O
drug O
did O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
and O
after O
9 O
years O
my O
liver O
enzyme O
tests O
suddenly O
were O
in O
a O
good O
range O
. O
I O
believe O
a O
good O
diet O
can O
do O
more O
for O
me O
than O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O

None O
noticable O
. O

Over O
the O
past O
three O
years O
the O
drug O
has O
definately O
worked O
but O
I O
have O
developed O
almost O
a O
dibilitating O
problem O
with O
both O
of O
my O
arms O
. O
I O
am O
unable O
to O
move O
them O
in O
any O
direction O
but O
the O
normal O
motion O
. O
It O
has O
got O
to O
the O
point O
where O
turning O
over O
in O
bed O
wakes O
me O
up O
because O
of O
the O
pain B-Disease
it O
causes O
. O
I O
have O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
to O
determine O
if O
Lipior B-Drug
is O
causing O
this O
serious O
problem O
and O
the O
results O
said O
no O
it O
was O
n't O
. O
However O
, O
I O
even O
went O
to O
an O
orthopdetic O
surgeon O
and O
after O
he O
checked O
me O
out O
, O
he O
looked O
at O
the O
drugs O
that O
I O
take O
( O
i O
am O
also O
a O
type O
2 O
diabetic O
) O
and O
he O
said O
ahh O
, O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
more O
people O
taking O
this O
drug O
come O
to O
me O
with O
problems O
like O
this O
. O
I O
have O
an O
annual O
physical O
on O
8/27 O
and O
am O
going O
to O
tell O
the O
doctor O
I O
'm O
stopping O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
to O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

After O
about O
4 O
months O

Took O
for O
5 O
years O
and O
thought O
foot B-Disease
pain I-Disease
was O
from O
bunion B-Disease
and O
hammer B-Disease
toe I-Disease
until O
I O
started O
to O
review O

Severe B-Disease

sensation B-Disease
of I-Disease
cold I-Disease
toes I-Disease
when O
they O
were O
indeed O

at O
times O
I O
had O
severe B-Disease
burning I-Disease

the I-Disease
feet I-Disease

cramps I-Disease
, O
. O
It O
may O
have O
done O
an O
excellent O
job O
of O
reducing O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
it O
is O
important O
to O
have O
quality O
of O
life O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
that O
anymore O
. O
I O
WOULD O
NEVER O
TAKE O
LIPITOR B-Drug
( O
or O
any O
statin O
) O
AGAIN O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
. O

I O
did O
not O
experience O
any O
, O
but O
only O
took O
1 O
tab O
once O
a O
day O
for O
two O
days O
. O
I O
found O
that O
Voltaren B-Drug
took O
away O
all O
my O
pain B-Disease
, O
i O
rarely O
use O
pain O
relief O
because O
i O
find O
it O
never O
helps O
or O
takes O
too O
long O
to O
take O
affect O
and O
just O
`` O
soldier O
on O
'' O
. O
As O
i O
am O
only O
young O
and O
relatively O
healthy O
i O
did O
not O
experience O
any O
side O
effects O
. O
HOWEVER O
my O
parents O
both O
have O
had O
bad O
side O
effects O
. O
so O
i O
dont O
recommend O
it O
if O
you O
suffer O
from O
High B-Disease
blood I-Disease
pressure I-Disease
, O
IBS B-Disease
, O
are O
prone O
to O
stomache B-Disease
ulcers I-Disease
, O
prone O
to O
reflux B-Disease
, O
heart B-Disease
burn I-Disease
or O
are O
an O
asthmatic B-Disease
. O
Otherwise O
if O
like O
me O
you O
are O
healthy O
and O
just O
need O
pain O
relief O
when O
nothing O
else O
will O
cut O
it O
just O
take O
one O
a O
day O
, O
and O
dont O
stay O
on O
them O
. O
the O
chances O
of O
getting O
side O
effects O
seem O
to O
increase O
according O
to O
the O
length O
of O
time O
you O
continue O
using O
them O
( O
like O
most O
drugs O
) O
and O
the O
effectiveness B-Disease
of I-Disease
the I-Disease
pain I-Disease
relief I-Disease
can I-Disease
also I-Disease
wear I-Disease
off I-Disease
over I-Disease
time I-Disease

Did O

My O
Prostate O
Oncologist O
prescribed O
10 O
mg O
per O
day O
for O
high O
LDL O
. O
The O
first O
day O
I O
did O
my O
normal O
excercise O
routine O
, O
ran O
two O
miles O
, O
lifted O
weights O
, O
etc O
That O
night O
I O
had O
neck B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
and O
thought O
it O
was O
nothing O
. O
Took O
the O
second O
tablet O
the O
next O
day O
. O
Upon O
arising O
on O
the O
second O
day O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
I O
was O
very B-Disease
tired I-Disease
. O
Pain O
or O
cramping B-Disease
in I-Disease
both I-Disease
quads I-Disease
( I-Disease
above I-Disease
knee I-Disease
, I-Disease
back I-Disease
of I-Disease
leg I-Disease
) I-Disease
. O
I O
was O
not B-Disease
motivated I-Disease
to I-Disease
do I-Disease
anything I-Disease
. O
Spent O
most O
of O
the O
day O
in O
bed O
, O
reading O
a O
book O
, O
something O
I O
rarely O
do O
. O
By O
the O
afternoon O
I O
could O
barely O
function O
. O
Felt B-Disease
generally I-Disease
terrible I-Disease
, O
flu B-Disease
like I-Disease
symptoms I-Disease
, O
lower B-Disease
back I-Disease
ache I-Disease
, O
irritable B-Disease
, O
no B-Disease
motivation I-Disease
, O
and O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
knuckles I-Disease
, O
neck O
, O
and O
both O
upper O
legs O
. O
I O
had O
a O
worse B-Disease
headache I-Disease
than I-Disease
usual I-Disease
( I-Disease
I I-Disease
have I-Disease
migraine I-Disease
) I-Disease
, O
but O
who O
knows O
? O
Went O
to O
the O
internet O
and O
found O
this O
site O
. O
Saw O
Lipitor B-Drug
commercial O
on O
TV O
warning O
about O
muscle O
pain O
. O
I O
did O
not O
take O
the O
tablet O
today O
, O
and O
I O
am O
feeling O
better O
. O
I O
attribute O
the O
condition O
to O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
although O
there O
is O
no O
proof O
. O
I O
am O
a O
prostate B-Disease
cancer I-Disease
patient O
and O
take O
a O
number O
of O
other O
drugs O
, O
which O
raise O
the O
LDL O
. O
Apparently O
, O
some O
( O
a O
few O
) O
patients O
can O
not O
tolerate O
this O
drug O
. O
I O
note O
that O
there O
are O
some O
on O
this O
list O
who O
have O
permanent O
damage O
, O
so O
it O
is O
serious O
for O
some O
of O
us O
. O
My O
legs O
are O
still O
sore O
, O
and O
feel O
worse O
than O
they O
did O
after O
a O
day O
of O
agressive O
downhill O
skiing O
a O
week O
ago O
. O
Apparently O
this O
works O
for O
most O
, O
but O
some O
people O
have O
a O
severe O
and O
not O
so O
obvious O
reaction O
. O
Stop O
immediately O
if O
there O
is O
any O
muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O

I O
have O
never O
been O
so O
miserable O
in O
my O
life O
. O
Started O
out O
with O
severe B-Disease
back I-Disease
spasms I-Disease
, O
then O
had O
intense O
pain O
in O
my O
knees O
and O
spasms B-Disease
all I-Disease
throughout I-Disease
my I-Disease
legs I-Disease
. O
Weakness B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
right I-Disease
arm I-Disease
. O
The O
worst O
of O
all O
was O
feeling B-Disease
like I-Disease
I I-Disease
was I-Disease
walking I-Disease
through I-Disease
waist-deep I-Disease
mud I-Disease
, O
I B-Disease
simply I-Disease
could I-Disease
not I-Disease
walk I-Disease
. O
Extreme B-Disease
anxiety I-Disease
as O
well O
. O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
what O
an O
evil O
poison O
this O
is O
. O
My O
doctor O
never O
told O
me O
any O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
but O
since O
then O
I O
have O
learned O
of O
so O
many O
people O
with O
the O
same O
problems O
. O
Taking O
200 O
mg/day O
of O
COQ10 B-Drug
has O
helped O
immensely O
as O
well O
as O
the O
potassium B-Drug
of O
bananas O
. O

Both O
entire O
legs B-Disease
ached I-Disease
several O
hours O
a O
day O
, O
diziness B-Disease
, O
droped O
down O
to O
20mg O
every O
other O
day O
with O
more O
exercise O
and O
dont O
really O
have O
a O
problem O
to O
say O
, O
collest O
. O
is O
158 O
now O
. O
Lipitor B-Drug
brought O
me O
down O
about O
70 O
points O
, O
but O
diet O
was O
important O
at O
the O
time O
. O
Ive O
had O
5-bypass O
1985 O
and O
9-stents O
5 O
years O
ago O
Was O
on O
Mevecor B-Drug
and O
asked O
to O
change O
to O
lipitor B-Drug
as O
Mev B-Drug
was O
n't O
doing O
anything O
. O
I O
also O
take O
some O
alternatives O
which O
have O
definately O
made O
a O
differance O
. O
I O
dropped O
my O
Lipitor B-Drug
of O
20mg O
down O
to O
every O
other O
day O
instead O
of O
just O
laying O
off O
of O
it O
and O
this O
has O
been O
pretty O
much O
the O
case O
so O
far O
. O
Collestrol O
has O
stablized O
at O
147-158 O
and O
really O
not O
on O
any O
diet O
. O
I O
enjoy O
eating O
whatever O
comes O
along O
. O
. O

None O
that O
I O
noticed O
. O
I O
did O
take O
my O
blood O
pressure O
today O
though O
, O
and O
it O
was O
slightly O
elevated O
from O
the O
norm O
. O
I O
suspect O
the O
drug O
is O
responsible O
, O
but O
as O
I O
am O
only O
taking O
it O
short-term O
, O
I O
am O
not O
overly O
concerned O
. O
I O
had O
acute B-Disease
shoulder I-Disease
tendonitis I-Disease
and O
was O
in O
absolute O
agony B-Disease
. O
Within O
24 O
hours O
of O
taking O
this O
medicine O
, O
the O
inflammation B-Disease
was O
reduced O
dramatically O
and O
I O
have O
continued O
to O
improve O
, O
gaining O
back O
more O
of O
my O
range O
of O
motion O
with O
each O
day O
. O

Gave O
pretty O
good O
pain B-Disease
relief O
, O
with O
no O
side O
effects O
, O
and O
is O
very O
fast O
acting O
. O
Better O
than O
mobic B-Drug
. O

None O
for O
the O
first O
5 O
years O
. O
It O
DID O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
However O
, O
in O
the O
6th O
year O
, O
I O
developed O
terrible O
ankle/knee/leg/ O
hip B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
aching B-Disease
and O
soreness B-Disease
. O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
a O
muscle B-Disease
problem I-Disease
. O
I O
got O
so O
weak B-Disease
I O
had B-Disease
to I-Disease
use I-Disease
a I-Disease
cane I-Disease
to I-Disease
walk I-Disease
. O
Then O
, O
I O
had O
to O
use O
the O
handicapped O
carts O
in O
the O
grocery O
store O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
to O
get O
a O
handicapped O
permit O
because O
I O
could B-Disease
not I-Disease
walk I-Disease
more O
than O
25 O
steps O
. O
I O
could B-Disease
not I-Disease
sleep I-Disease

No O

. O
I O
tried O
the O
advertised O
Arthritis O
medicines O
with O
severe O
side-effects O
and O
only O
tried O
this O
one O
because O
the O
doctor O
had O
samples O
. O
Instead O
of O
taking O
the O
pill O
2X O
daily O
, O
as O
prescribed O
I O
take O
it O
at O
most O
once O
per O
day O
, O
usually O
about O
3-4 O
times O
per O

often O
skipping O
a O

two O
at O
a O
time O
. O
My O
arthritis B-Disease
has O
been O
under O
control O
for O

and O
only O
causes O
me O
trouble O
if O
I O
skip O
taking O
the O
pills O
for O
about O
a O
month O
. O
At O
the O
time O
this O
was O
prescribed O
the O
doctor O
was O
discussing O
the O
strongest O
possible O
medicines O
in O
serious O
( O
threatening O
) O
doses O
. O
This O
drug O
has O
been O
a O
god-send O
for O
me O
. O

If O
you O

a O
severe B-Disease
pain I-Disease
of O

origin O
this O
is O
the O
best O
I O
've O
suffered O

almost O
4 O
month O
without O

a O
reason O

It O
was O
a O

Ifyou O

first O
of O
all O

an O

( O
I O
thought O
it O
might O
be O
the O
Advil B-Drug
I O
had O
taken O
earlier O

in O
) O
However O
, O
several O

later O
, O

pain I-Disease
in I-Disease
wrist I-Disease
. O
Squeezed O
out O
a O
few O

it O
in O

pain B-Disease
relief O
was O
almost O
immediate O
. O
I O
read O
that O
this O
is O
prescribed O
for O
knee B-Disease
pain I-Disease
but O
my O
doctor O
gave O
me O
a O
sample O
because O
the O
voltaren B-Drug
has O
worked O
ok O
for O
me O
and O
I O
ca O
n't O
take O
Advil B-Drug
a O

positive O
results O
. O
Doctor O
had O
my O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
Tricor B-Drug
which O
seems O
to O
increase O
the O
chances O
of O
side O
effects O
. O
This O
is O
very O
scary O
, O
thought O
I O
had O
some O
type O
of O

Will O

First O
started O

a O
stiff B-Disease
neck I-Disease

That O

then O
it O
was O
my O
knee O
. O
The O
pain O
has O
since O
radiated O
to O
wrists O
and O
hips O
. O
I O
felt O
general B-Disease
malaise I-Disease
and O
depression B-Disease
. O
When O
shopping O
, O
I O
needed O
a O
cart O
for O
support O
. O
This O
is O
very O
unlike O
me O
. O
I O
have O
been O
on O
this O
drug O
for O
almost O
3 O
years O
. O
I O
have O
a O
very O
high O
tolerance O
to O
pain O
, O
so O
I O
hesitated O
to O
call O
my O
doctor O
thinking O
the O
pain B-Disease
would O
go O
away O
. O
When O
I O
did O
call O
, O
his O
advice O
, O
get O
off O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
! O
I O
was O
glad O
to O
find O

That O

, O
but O
in O
my O
case O
it O
came O
with O
mild O
side O
effects O
like O
general B-Disease
body I-Disease
stiffness I-Disease
and O
muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O
I O
'll O
ask O
for O
another O
medicine O
. O

Unusually O
fatigued B-Disease
in O
afternoon O

Felt B-Disease
lazy I-Disease
and O
unmotivated B-Disease

Went O

rededicated O
myself O

Now O

has O
dropped O
another O
15 O
lbs O

and O
lack B-Disease
of I-Disease

After O
about O
4 O
years O
of O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
I O
started O
experiencing O
severe B-Disease
leg I-Disease
cramping I-Disease
at O
night O
with O
the O
pain O
traveling O
to O
my O
buddocks O
and O
stomach O
as O
well O
. O
The O
pain B-Disease
was O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
had O
to O
crawl O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bathroom O
to O
take O
Advil B-Drug
for O
the O
pain B-Disease
. O
I O
asked O
my O
doctor O
what O
could O
have O
caused O
this O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
from O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
Recently O
I O
experienced O
extreme O
stomach B-Disease
pain I-Disease
that O
stretched O
to O
my O
side O
and O
back O
. O
The O
stomach B-Disease
pain I-Disease
came O
suddenly O
and O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
for O
a O
week O
before O
it O
became O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
sleep O
. O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
urinery B-Disease
tract I-Disease
infection I-Disease
and O
I O
thought O
it O
had O
returned O
but O
the O
symptoms O
were O
different O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
urge B-Disease
to I-Disease
urinate I-Disease
constantly I-Disease
but O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
and O
I O
would O
have O
no O
symptoms O
for O
a O
day O
then O
it O
would O
return O
again O
. O
I O
remembered O
reading O
the O
phamplet O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
it O
mentioning O
some O
of O
symptoms O
that O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
a O
day O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
mor O
. O
I O
think O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
to O
lowering O
cholesterol O
than O
such O
a O
potent O
drug O
that O
can O
cause O
so O
many O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
case-study O
when O
they O
finally O
take O
this O
drug O
off O
the O
market O
. O

Taking O
40mg O
daily O
for O
several O
years O
. O

much O
lower O
, O

higher O
, O

. O

Lipitor B-Drug
cut O
my O
LDL O
in O
half O
while O
my O
HDL O
increased O
slightly O
. O
My O
total O
cholesterol O
went O
from O
240 O
to O
140 O
. O

Sterted O
with O
swelling B-Disease
in I-Disease
one I-Disease
ankle I-Disease
then O
a O
knee O
thenb O
the O
other O
knee O
. O
Also O
lots O
of O
soreness O
in O
shoulders O
and O
some O
general O
lowering B-Disease
of I-Disease
energy I-Disease
. O

I O
've O
been O
taking O
Liptor B-Drug
for O
about O
a O
year O
with O
no O
major O
side O

, O
but O
recently O
I O
have O
been O
experiencing O
a O
sore B-Disease
, I-Disease
tingly I-Disease

( I-Disease
Glossitis I-Disease
) I-Disease
and O

ruled O
out O

I O
have O
also O
had O
dizzy B-Disease
spells I-Disease
, O
headaches B-Disease
, O
and O
trouble B-Disease
sleeping I-Disease
. O
Doctor O
told O
me O
to O
discontinue O
Lipitor B-Drug
which O
I O
just O
did O
a O
couple O
days O
ago O
and O
I O
should O
know O
in O
a O
month O
or O
so O
if O
this O
is O
the O
cause O
( O
glossitis B-Disease
and O
other O
symptoms O
are O
listed O
as O
possible O
side O
effects O
, O
although O
in O
my O
case O
it O
's O
been O
a O
delayed O
reaction O
) O
Lipitor B-Drug
did O
bring O
my O
cholesterol O
down O
from O
268 O
to O
153 O
but O
I O
want O
the O
glossitis B-Disease
, O
headaches B-Disease
and O
dizziness B-Disease
to O
go O
away O
. O
I O
hate O
feeling O
this O
way O
. O
I O
will O
find O
another O
way O
to O
control O
my O
cholesterol O
if O
Lipitor B-Drug
proves O
to O
be O
the O
culprit O
. O

Confusion B-Disease

Returned O

a O
week O
of O
quitting O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
I O
had O
rather O
risk O
living O
with O
a O
228 O
cholesterol O
level O
than O
deal O
with O
the O
memory B-Disease
loss I-Disease
. O
It O
was O
quite O
frightening O
as O
it O
seemed O
like O
incipient B-Disease

. O

some O

some O

it O
works O
very O
well O
for O
the O

; O
I O
could O

on O
it O
very O

before O

I O
realize O
that O
a O
knee O
replacement O
is O
inevitable O
, O

I O
need O
the O

My O

Lipitor B-Drug
as O
a O

Possible O
body O
stiffness O

joint B-Disease
pain I-Disease

My O
mother O
started O
taking O
40 O
mg. O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
3 O
months O
ago O
. O
During O
the O
first O
month O
she O
complained O
about O
her O
head B-Disease
hurting I-Disease
. O
She O
began O
getting O
very B-Disease
confused I-Disease
. O
She O
was O
always O
exhausted B-Disease
, O
falling B-Disease
asleep I-Disease
all I-Disease
the I-Disease
time I-Disease
. O
Complained O
about O
her O
legs B-Disease
always I-Disease
feeling I-Disease
like I-Disease
lead I-Disease
. O
Within O
the O
last O
six O
weeks O
, O
her O
physical O
health O
has O
deteriorated O
to O
the O
point O
of O
her O
being O
confined O
to O
a O
wheelchair O
, O
in O
constant O
pain O
with O
her O
shoulders O
, O
knees O
, O
and O
a O
feeling O
like O
her O
whole B-Disease
body I-Disease
hurts I-Disease
. O
She O
shakes O
as O
if O
she O
has O
Parkinsons B-Disease
. O
If O
I O
had O
not O
seen O
the O
news O
recently O
about O
the O
two O
men O
suing O
Pfizer O
over O
what O
Lipitor B-Drug
had O
done O
to O
their O
lives O
, O
I O
would O
n't O
have O
even O
thought O
about O
that O
being O
the O
cause O
. O
Finding O
this O
website O
confirmed O
it O
. O
I O
have O
taken O
her O
off O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
and O
am O
hoping O
that O
alot O
of O
her O
pain B-Disease
and O
fatigue B-Disease
and O
muscle B-Disease
problems I-Disease
will O
start O
to O
get O
better O
, O
although O
it O
scares O
me O
that O
alot O
of O
people O
are O
saying O
they O
have O
n't O
improved O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
know O
about O
this O
a O
week O
after O
she O
started O
with O
the O
symptoms O
. O
I O
would O
NEVER O
recommend O
this O
drug O
to O
anyone O
! O
It O
has O
ruined O
whatever O
years O
my O
mother O
had O
left O
to O
enjoy O
life O

she O
was O
very O
active O
for O
her O

My O

I O
check O

immidiately O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
no O
side O

Some O

early O
on O
, O
which O
has O
subsided O
. O
I O
do O
have O
some O
weight O
around O
the O
middle O
which O
I O
was O
n't O
noticing O
so O
much O
before O
, O
but O
this O
may O
be O
due O
to O
fact O
I O
'm O
now O
in O
my O
early O
40 O
's O
. O
I O
've O
started O
exercising/dieting O
more O
and O
lost O
15 O
pounds O
in O
last O
month O
, O
but O
not O
around O
the O
middle O
much O
. O
Some O
darkness B-Disease
in I-Disease
urine I-Disease
, O
but O
I O
think O
it O
's O
due O
to O
not O
enough O
fluids O
. O
Nonetheless O
, O
I O
'm O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
drug O
. O
Went O
from O

the O
fact O
I O
was O
n't O
dieting O
as O
much O
as O
I O
should O
have O
been O
. O
Now O
on O
40mg O
but O
am O
eating O
more O
healthy O
and O
will O
have O
blood O
checked O
soon O
. O
Am O
hoping O
to O
go O
back O
to O
20mg O
, O
though O
I O
have O
not O
seen O
any O
difference O
symptom-wise O
between O
20 O
and O
40 O
. O
I O
lost O
an O
older O
brother O
to O
a O

attack I-Disease
last O
year O
and O
everyone O
at O
the O
funeral O
said O
he O
had O
STOPPED O
taking O
his O
Lipitor B-Drug
! O
I O
wo O
n't O
make O

mistake O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
this O
medicine O
for O
about O
8 O
years O
. O
Reduce O
my O
cholesterol O
level O
for O
8.6 O
to O
4.8 O
over O
a O
3 O
month O
period O
. O
This O
has O
meant O
that O
I O
can O
eat O
and O
live O
a O
normal O
life O
. O
Over O
time O
however O
I O
have O
noticed O
the O
occassional O
muscle B-Disease
soreness I-Disease
, O
lower B-Disease
back I-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
now O
a O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
left I-Disease
hip I-Disease
. O
The O
hip B-Disease
pain I-Disease
is O
a O
muscle O
that O
continually O
knots O
up O
and O
often O
needs O
physiotheraphy O
to O
fix O
it O
. O
Over O
the O
last O
few O
years O
years O
6 O
- O
8 O
of O
using O
this O
product O
I O
have O
noticed O
that O
from O
time O
to O
time O
I O
suffer O
from O
unusual O
amount O
of O
vagueness B-Disease
, O
short B-Disease
term I-Disease
memory I-Disease
loss I-Disease
and O
shortness B-Disease
of I-Disease
breath I-Disease
. O
The O
muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
keeps O
me O
awake O
at O
night O
and O
life O
is O
just O
a O
pain O
, O
but O
I O
must O
point O
out O
I O
am O
not O
feel O
depressed O
about O
it O
at O
all O
. O
I O
just O
get O
on O
with O
life O
and O
try O
to O
manage O
the O
muscle B-Disease
pains I-Disease
. O
I O
am O
today O
a O
bit O
concerned O
after O
being O
feeling O
strange O
for O
about O
the O
last O
3 O
week O
, O
by O
strange O
I O
mean O
daily O
events O
of O
vagues B-Disease
, O
loss B-Disease
of I-Disease
short I-Disease
term I-Disease
memory I-Disease
, O
head B-Disease
aches I-Disease
and O
shortness B-Disease
of I-Disease
breath I-Disease
so O
I O
when O
to O
see O
the O
doctor O
and O
he O
suggested O
I O
stop O
taking O
the O
med O
. O
Worked O
well O
for O
the O
first O
5 O
years O
but O
cholesterol O
seems O
to O
have O
creeped O
up O
a O
bit O
from O
4.4 O
to O
5.3 O
over O
years O
6 O
, O
7 O
& O
8 O
. O

I O
can O
hardly O
believe O
that O
a O
topically O
applied O
gel O
is O
causing O
this O
stuff O
, O
but O
it O
gets O
better O
when O
I O
quit O
using O
it O
and O
returns O
when O
I O
do O
use O
it O
. O
hard B-Disease
to I-Disease
breathe I-Disease
, O
lungs B-Disease
feel I-Disease
heavy I-Disease
, O
general O
feeling O
of O
sadness B-Disease
, O
tiredness B-Disease
, O
wanting B-Disease
to I-Disease
quit I-Disease
everything I-Disease
and I-Disease
give I-Disease
up I-Disease
( O
SOOOOOO O
not O
my O
personality O
) O
. O
I O
was O
blaming O
my O
antibiotic B-Drug
for O
these O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
now O
I O
see O
that O
they O
come O
and O
go O
with O
the O
use O
of O
the O
solaraze B-Drug
. O
Scary O
. O
LEt O
me O
be O
the O
first O
to O
say O
that O
I O
have O
extremely O
porous O
skin O
, O
so O
I O
am O
probably O
absorbing O
a O
higher O
dose O
than O
was O
thought O
likely O
, O
I O
have O
eczema B-Disease
and O
take O
other O
meds O
that O
exfoliate O
my O
skin O
, O
so O
probably O
a O
whopping O
dose O
is O
going O
in O
. O
I O
have O
found O
that O
I O
can O
use O
a O
q-tip O
and O
just O
put O
it O
on O
a O
few O
spots O
and O
then O
do O
not O
get O
the O
global O
bad O
effect O
, O
so O
I O
may O
do O
it O
this O
way O
and O
just O
treat O
one O
arm O
at O
a O
time O
, O
then O
one O
leg O
. O

I O
was O
on O
10 O
mgs O
. O
and O
then O
cut O
it O
in O
half O
for O
over O
two O
years O
. O
Stopped O
taking O
it O
11/04 O
due O
to O
severe O
legs O
problems O
; O
muscle B-Disease
aches I-Disease
/ O
weakness B-Disease
/ O
stiffness B-Disease
, O
cramps B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
feet I-Disease
and O
hands O
, O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
arms I-Disease
and O
chest O
, O
memory B-Disease
problems I-Disease
along O
with O
vision B-Disease
problems I-Disease
. O
This O
drug O
needs O
to O
be O
taken O
off O
the O
market O
and O
doctors O
need O
to O
realize O
how O
much O
damage O
it O
has O
done O
to O
many O
innocent O
people O
. O

Just O
before O
this O
last O
Christmas O
I O
had O
a O
small O
stroke B-Disease
and O
spent O
three O
days O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O
To O
make O
a O
long O
story O
short O
, O
there O
are O
no O
after O
effects O
of O
the O
stroke O
. O
In O
other O
words O
the O
symptoms O
went O
away O
. O
But O
, O
my O
Doc O
put O
me O
on O
Aggrenox O
and O
20mg O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
I O
have O
very O
high O
arches O
and O
have O
had O
a O
little O
tingling B-Disease
in O
my O
feet O
for O
years O
. O
This O
is O
really O
helped O
with O
a O
good O
arch O
support O
. O
But O
for O
the O
last O
two O
months O
the O
pain B-Disease
in O
my O
feet O
and O
calves O
( O
and O
sometimes O
thigh O
) O
has O
gotten O
much O
worse O
. O
I O
can B-Disease
not I-Disease
walk I-Disease
very O
far O
and O
sleeping O
has O
become O
a O
problem O
because O
of O
the O
pain B-Disease
. O
Because O
of O
the O
preexisting O
arch B-Disease
problem I-Disease
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
just O
naturally O
getting O
worse O
but O
after O
finding O
this O
web O
site O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
is O
not O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
On O
a O
pain B-Disease
scale O
it O
has O
gone O
from O
a O
1 O
or O
2 O
to O
7 O
or O
8 O
. O
I O
have O
a O
followup O
apointment O
with O
my O
Doctor O
in O
two O
days O
and O
was O
thinking O
of O
asking O
him O
if O
I O
could O
go O
off O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
What O
do O
you O
think O
? O
. O

after O
I O
had O
been O
on O
it O
for O
3 O
months O
, O
started O
breaking O
out O
in O
blisters B-Disease
, O
and O
my O
face O
looked O
like O
it O
was O
on O
fire O
. O
the O
dr O
took O
me O
off O
of O
it O
. O
but O
it O
helped O
my O
cholestrol O
. O

Tastes O
gross O
-- O
heavy O
mint O

. O
Felt O
like O
it O
was O
burning B-Disease
my I-Disease
esophagus I-Disease
all O
the O

down O
, O
then O
dry O
heaves O
once O
it O
hit O
my O
stomach O
. O
But O
it O
did O
n't O
make O
me O
actually O
vomit B-Disease
, O
and O
the O
burning B-Disease
sensation I-Disease
went O
away O
quickly O
. O
Was O
prescribed O
Cambia B-Drug
as O
a O
backup O
to O
Maxalt B-Drug
, O
since O
triptans B-Drug
can O
be O
taken O
only O
2 O
days/week O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
it O
did O
n't O
work O
at O
all O
on O
my O
migraines B-Disease
, O
so O
I O
'll O
continue O
to O
look O
for O

else O
as O
a O
backup O

the O

left O
us O
floundering O
on O
our O
own O
, O
going O
from O
one O
specialist O

another O
to O
counter O
what O
was O
happening O

My O

some O

I O
was O

included O

about O
the O

I O
stopped O
Voltaren B-Drug

conclusion O

I O
stopped O

After O

I O
quickly O

cause O
me O
more O
pain B-Disease
. O
The O
side O
effects O
are O
much O
worst O
than O

itself O

I O

continues O
even O
after O
stopping O
the O

I O
took O
the O

9 O
months O
( O
my O
doctor O
said O
the O
pains B-Disease
were O
n't O
from O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
because O
there O
was O
no O
indication O
in O
the O

years O

with O

mg O
then O
6 O
mos O
later O
doc O
upped O

20 O
. O
About O
3 O
mos O
ago O
I O
had O
several O
severe O
left O
leg B-Disease
cramps I-Disease
-never O
had O
them O
before O
. O
Then O
about O
2-3 O
weeks O
later O
, O
woke O
up O
and O
could B-Disease
barely I-Disease
stand I-Disease
and I-Disease
walk I-Disease
. O
Legs O
and O
toes O
were O
numb B-Disease
( O
worse O
in O
left O
) O
, O
weak B-Disease
, O
back B-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
calves B-Disease
hurt I-Disease
terribly O
. O
Walking O
was O
possible O
but O
only O
with O
intense O
effort O
and O
pain B-Disease
. O
Could O
n't O
stand O
for O
more O
than O
1 O
or O
2 O
minutes-too O
painful B-Disease
and O
weak B-Disease
. O
Waited O
a O
couple O
3 O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
it O
would O
clear O
up-did O
not O
. O
Went O
to O
doc O
. O
Took O
x-rays O
said O
everything O
fine O
, O
blood O
test O
fine O
. O
Interested O
in O
doing O
MRI-thinking O
nacrotic O
nerve O
in O
lower O
spine O
. O
On O
an O
aside O
he O
said O
stop O
taking O
lipitor B-Drug
on O
an O
off O
chanch O
it O
may O
be O
an O
uncommon O
reaction O
. O
I O
started O
looking O
up O
lipitor B-Drug
reactions O
and O
came O
across O
so O
much O
info O
on O
side O
effects O
it O
was O
startling O
. O
I O
look O
back O
to O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
years O
ago O
when O
I O
no O
longer O
had O
that O
special B-Disease
feeling I-Disease
that I-Disease
all I-Disease
males I-Disease
experience I-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
organ I-Disease
and O
a O
decreased B-Disease
sex I-Disease
drive I-Disease
( O
not O
typical O
for O
me O
) O
. O
At O
the O
time O
I O
attributed O
it O
to O
male O
menopause-being O
around O
54 O
. O
I O
went O
to O
my O
accupuncturist O
and O
was O
told O
my O
chee O
was O
dry O
. O
Had O
4 O
treatments O
over O
as O
many O
weeks O
. O
Started O
to O
see O
some O
improvement O
. O
At O
the O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
would O
imagine O
someone O
that O
had O
MS B-Disease
would O
feel O
like O
, O
swaying B-Disease
, O
pulling O
myself O
up O
stairs O
, O
dragging B-Disease
legs I-Disease
. O
After O
having O
stopped O
lipitor B-Drug
and O
acupuncture O
treatments O
, O
I O
would O
say O
I O
am O
at O
about O
50 O
or O
55 O
% O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
continue O
to O
keep O
getting O
better O
as O
this O
has O
really O
hit O
my O
life O
at O
a O
bad O
time O
. O
My O
cholesterol O
did O
go O
down O
but O
If O
I O
knew O
I O
would O
have O
these O
kinds O
of O
problems O
I O
would O
never O
have O
started O
taking O
the O
drug O
nor O
will O
I O
EVER O
AGAIN O
take O
it O
irregardless O
of O
my O
cholesterol O
level O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
to O
those O
who O
have O
not O
had O
any O
lessening O
of O
symptons O
to O
try O
accupuncture O
. O

to O
my O

after O
just O
3 O
weeks O
of O
5 O
mg./day O
about O
muscle O
and O
joint B-Disease
pains I-Disease
. O
( O
I O
stopped O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
myself O
after O
reading O
the O
label O
warnings O
. O
The O
pain B-Disease
stopped O
within O
days O
. O
) O
He O
checked O
the O
CK O
reading O
, O
which O
came O
back O
negeative O
. O
I O
used O
to O
work O
out O
at O
a O
gym O
for O
one O
hour O
twice O
a O
week O
, O
and O
he O
suggested O
that O
I O
was O
getting O
older O
and O
the O
workouts O
might O
be O
too O
extreme O
. O
I O
went O
back O
to O
taking O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
began O
cutting O
back O
on O
my O
exercise O
. O
After O
6 O
months O
, O
in O
agony O
, O
I O
went O
for O
more O
blood O
work O
-- O
everything O
was O
negative O
. O
After O
9 O
months O
I O
stopped O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
myself O
, O
but O
by O
then O
I O
was O
a O
mess O
: O
could B-Disease
n't I-Disease
walk I-Disease
, O
could B-Disease
n't I-Disease
lift I-Disease
my I-Disease

, O
horrible O

body I-Disease
, O
particularly O
the O
Achilles O
tendon O
and O
those O
on O
the O
back O
of O
the O
head O
. O
My O
family O
doctor O
was O
at O
a O
loss O
. O
I O
went O
to O
a O
NY O
neurologist O
, O
then O
to O
a O
neuromuscular O
doctor O
who O
said O
it O
sounded O
like O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
even O
though O
I O
had O
been O
off O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
almost O
6 O
months O
. O
He O
suggested O
coenzymeQ10 B-Drug
, O
600 O
mg O
per O
day O
. O

My O
fingers O
swelled O
up O
and O
hurt O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
gout B-Disease
or O
arthritis B-Disease
. O
My O
joints B-Disease

my I-Disease
hands I-Disease
hurt I-Disease

My O
knee O

It O

my I-Disease

. O
I O
took O
10 O
mg. O
each O
day O
for O
120 O
days O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
lipitor B-Drug
now O
for O
40 O
days O
and O
joint B-Disease
pain I-Disease
is O
slowly O
improving O
and O
not O
as O
bad O
. O
I O
have O
lost O
trust O
in O
most O
doctors O
. O
they O
are O
only O
doing O
what O
they O
know O
, O
which O
is O
very O

there O
are O
natural O

Neurologist O

and O

stated O
my O
symptoms O
were O
not O
all O
related O
to O

side O
effects O
. O
After O
trying O
Zocor B-Drug
, O
Provachol B-Drug
, O
Zetia B-Drug
and O
Crestor B-Drug
, O
Lipitor B-Drug
seemed O
to O
be O
the O
lessor O
of O
the O
evils O
with O
regard O
to O
side O
effects O
. O
However O
, O
due O
to O
heart B-Disease
problems I-Disease
, O
cardiologist O
gradually O
increased O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
dosage O
from O
10mg O
to O
40mg O
. O
Symptoms O
have O
been O
gradual O
over O
the O
years O
with O
recent O
face B-Disease
and I-Disease

problems I-Disease
diagnosed O
as O
trigeminal B-Disease
neuralgia I-Disease
after O
MRI O
ruled O
out O
tumor O
or O
MS B-Disease
. O
After O
reading O
your O
comments O
regarding O
Liptior B-Drug
, O
I O
have O
decided O
to O
reduce O
the O
dosage O
from O
40mg O
to O
20mg O
for O
a O
week O
to O
see O
if O
this O
relieves O
the O
most O
recent O
symptoms O
. O
If O
improvement O
is O
noted O
, O
then O
I O
will O
contact O
my O
doctor O
for O
a O
further O
reduction O
in O
the O
dosage O
to O
determine O
if O
other O
symptoms O
abate O
. O
I O
appreciate O
all O
the O
feedback O
on O
this O
medication O
and O
will O
keep O
you O
posted O
on O
my O
progress O
. O

I O
took O
this O
drug O
for O
2 O
years O
before O
onset O
of O
joint B-Disease
pain I-Disease
( I-Disease
knees I-Disease
) I-Disease
and O
painfull B-Disease
welts I-Disease
on I-Disease
bottom I-Disease
of I-Disease
feet I-Disease
( O
had O
to O
use O

to O

) O
. O
Initially O
, O
my O
quack O
MD O
put O
me O
on O
anti-inflam O
. O
drugs O
. O
Subsequently O
, O
I O
quit O
the O
drug O
and O
the O
MD O
. O
All O
symptoms O
subsided O
completely O
. O
However O
, O
I O
had O
a O
milder O
reaction O
to O
Zocor B-Drug
; O
dizziness B-Disease
with O
Pravachol B-Drug
; O
now O
on O
Zetia B-Drug
( O
mild B-Disease
joint I-Disease
pain I-Disease
) O
. O
I O
believe O
that O
Lipitor B-Drug
left O
me O
with O
permanent B-Disease
joint I-Disease
damage I-Disease
and O
would O
join O
any O

over O
four O

the O

of O
the O
side O

their O
likely O
root O

finally O
hit O
me O
over O
the O

The O
adverse O
effects O
were O
insidiously O
gradual O
in O
their O
development O
which O
kept O
the O
alarm O

from O
going O
off O
sooner O
. O
Like O
many O
, O
I O
attributed O
each O
individual O
symptom O
to O
. O

It O
began O
with O
stomach B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
then O
slight B-Disease
nausea I-Disease

then O

time O
I O
took O
a O

the O

symptoms O
only O
now O
the O
abdominal B-Disease

would O
be O
with O

all O
day O

I O
stopped O
pills O

abdominal B-Disease
cramps I-Disease
persist O
. O
The O
only O
good O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
about O
Arthrotec B-Drug
is O
that O
I O
did O
notice O
pain B-Disease
relief O
but O
I O
wo O
n't O
put O
up O
with O
the O
side O
effects O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O

I O
spent O
a O
long O
time O
getting O

a O

problem O
in O
the O
past O
. O
The O
abdominal B-Disease

, O

and O

are O
another O
thing O
I O
do O
n't O
want O

I O

I O

better O
. O
I O
noticed O
a O
difference O
within O
a O
week O

These O

are O
poison O
and O
should O
be O
taken O
off O
the O

E I-Drug

and O
heal O
my O
body O
. O
From O
all O
the O
reading O
I O
have O
done O
, O
the O
doctor O
should O
have O
told O
me O
to O
take O
this O
because O
the O
statins O
deplete O
your O
body O
of O
CoQ10 O
. O

The O
side O
effects O
came O
slowly O
and O
it O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
make O
the O
connection O
. O
I O
slowly O
started O
experiencing O
pain O
in O
one O
shoulder O
joint O
then O
the O
other O
. O
Then O
deep B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
pain I-Disease
in O
the O
muscle O
of O
one O

then O
the O

. O
Finally O
after O
the O
muscles B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
chest I-Disease
started I-Disease
aching I-Disease
and O
insomnia B-Disease
had O
set O
in O

I O
called O
my O
doctor O
who O
took O
me O
off O
the O
10 O
mg. O
dosage O
. O
Looking O
back O
I O
realize O
now O
that O
I O
had O
symptoms O
early O
on O
but O
chose O
to O
overlook O
them O
. O
Bad O
choice O
on O
my O
part O
. O
I O
hope O
now O
that O
the O
9 O
months O
of O
taking O
these O
meds O
has O
n't O
caused O
permanent O
damage O
! O
! O
. O
After O
reading O
more O
about O
the O
medication O
I O
can O
only O
say O
that O
for O
me O
. O
I O
am O
done O
with O
taking O
statins O
. O
I O
will O
control O
my O
cholesterol O
by O
losing O
weight O
, O
exercise O
and O
diet O
. O
It O
did O
lower O
my O
total O
cholesterol O

my O
LDL O
's O
but O
the O
effect O
it O
had O
on O
my O
overall O
well O

The O
doc O
. O
put O
me O
on O
seroquel B-Drug
after O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
bi-polar B-Disease
, O
SO O
much O
worse O
than O
being O
crazy O
. O
I O
've O
been O
off O
both O
medications O
and O
have O
returned O
to O
normal O
. O
This O
drug O
was O
casually O
prescribed O
as O
a O
pain O
reliever O
, O
it O
had O
serious O
side O
efeects O
and O
would O
not O
use O
it O
if O
there O
is O
ANY O
alternative O
. O
Take O
your O
ibuprofen B-Drug

Can O
not O
be O
sure O
it O
is O
the O
drug O
, O
but O
around O
the O
time O
I O
was O
on O
it O
a O
month O
, O
began O
having O
pain O
on O
outer O
sides O
of O
thighs O
. O
Knowing O
some O
cholesterol O
meds O
can O
cause O
leg B-Disease
pain I-Disease
my O
doc O
did O
some O
kind O
of O
check O
on O
me O
and O
said O
it O
was O
not O
the O
drug O
. O
Still O
have O
those O
pains B-Disease
, O
not O
terrible O
, O
just O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
been O
hiking O
uphill O
and O
am O
fatigued O
there O
. O
Has O
done O
a O
very O
good O
job O
keeping O
cholesterol O
down O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
request O
lowering O
the O
dose O
w/ O
the O
doc O
. O

I O
can O
not O
believe O
the O
immediate O
difference O
this O
medication O
had O
made O
in O
my O
life O
. O
I O
could O
not O
get O
up O
from O
my O
desk O
without O
holding O
onto O
the O
desk O
and O
walking B-Disease
up I-Disease
the I-Disease
stairs I-Disease
was I-Disease
intolerable I-Disease
. O
Within O
one O
day O
I O
felt O
the O
pain B-Disease
lessen O
. O
I O
am O
now O
walking O
up O
the O
stairs O
95 O
% O
normal O
and O
can O
actually O
walk O
through O
a O
mall O
without O
having O
to O
sit O
down O
every O
5 O
minutes O
. O
i O
am O
in O
need O
of O
a O
knee O
replacement O
, O
but O
in O
meantime O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
my O
life O
back O
. O

none O
whatsoever O
. O
I O
started O
taking O
voltaren B-Drug
twice O
a O
day O
and O
then O
switched O
to O
once O
a O
day O
which O
pretty O
much O
takes O
away O
all O
my O
pain B-Disease
. O
However O
, O
I O
have O
read O
so O
much O
on O
the O
side O
effects O
that O
I O
now O
only O
take O
it O
once O
or O
twice O
a O
week O
. O
I O
am O
68 O
and O
if O
I O
take O
it O
every O
day O
I O
feel O
like O
a O
25 O
yr O
old O
. O
It O
also O
takes O
care O
of O
all O
my O
arthritis B-Disease
pain O
as O
well O
. O
I O
love O
it O
and O
wish O
it O
did O
n't O
have O
so O
many O
side O
effects O
. O

no O
. O

I O
took O
this O
drug O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
went O
off O
it O
because O
my O
hair O
started O
thinning O
. O
This O
time O
around O
I O
am O
feeling O
very O
depressed B-Disease
, O
tired B-Disease
and O
nervous B-Disease
. O
I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
is O
the O
drug O
, O
but O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
go O
off O
it O
to O
see O
. O
Oh O

So O
I O
take O
it O
before O
going O
to O
sleep O

Strange O

. O
Ratio O
is O
also O
a O

but O
the O
lowering O
of O
my O
good O

has O
my O
doctor O
thinking O
I O
need O
yet O
another O
drug O
to O
bring O
good O
cholesterol O
back O
up O
. O

It O
only O
took O
three O
pills O
only O
one O
a O
day O
to O
realize O
that O
the O
side O
effects O
can O
be O
quite O
dangerous O

night O
my O
heart B-Disease

this O

can O
be O

. O
Side O

can O
easily O
bring O
you O
closer O
to O
the O
grave O

now O
on O
80 O
mg O
and O
feeling O
extremely O

Why O
am O
I O
on O
80 O

? O
because O
the O

required O
a O
trial O
at O
this O

, O
before O
I O
can O
switch O
to O
an O
alternative O
and O
reduce O
the O

back O
to O
40 O
mg O
. O
Since O
when O
did O
the O
insurance O
company O
go O
to O
med O
school O
so O
they O
can O
dictate O
what O
I O
should O

My O
Dr O
sent O
me O
to O
a O
Rheumatologist O
as O

suspected O
that O
I O
had O
Lupus B-Disease
. O
Within O
2 O
days O
of O
stopping O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
my O
symptoms O
began O
to O
subside O
. O
The O
leg B-Disease

is O
gone O
, O
I O
have O
lots O
of O
energy O

I O
can O
sleep O

What O
a O
concept O
! O
! O
. O
It O
did O
significantly O
and O
quickly O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
numbers O
, O
but O
they O
would O
immediately O
go O
back O
up O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
went O
off O
of O
it O
. O
I O
eat O
steel-cut O
oats O
every O

to O
the O
point O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
have O
to O
quit O
my O
job O
. O
This O
drug O
dramatically O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
but O
ruined O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
After O
repeated O
visits O
to O
my O
doctor O
complaining O
of O
these O
debilitating O
symptoms O
he O
finally O
made O
the O
connection O
and O
took O
me O
off O
. O
Within O
3 O
days O
, O
I O
started O
to O
feel O
like O
myself O
again O

Cholesterol O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
brain O
and O
nerve O
function O
and O
is O
essential O
to O
our O
good O
overall O
health O
. O
Do O
your O
research O
. O
Stripping O
your O
body O
of O
it O
can O
be O
devastating O
. O
I O
would O
much O
rather O
take O
my O
chances O
with O
a O
slightly O
elevated O
level O
than O
go O
through O
that O
again O
. O
Horrible O
. O
Pfizer O
should O
be O
ashamed O
of O
themselves O
for O
not O
clearly O
stating O
the O
possibility O
of O
these O
side O
effects O
. O

After O
being O
on O
10 O
mg O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
about O
3 O
years O
, O
I O
started O
to O
experience O
speech O
and O
swallowing O
problems O
which O
got O
worse O
while O
I O
continued O
to O
take O
it O
as O
recommended O
by O
my O
physician O
. O
After O
6 O
months O
, O
my O
speech O
and O
swallowing O
were O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
stopped O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
It O
is O
now O
one O
year O
after O
stopping O
and O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
ALS B-Disease
( O
which O
tests O
later O
verified O
was O
incorrect O
) O
and O
I O
think O
that O
I O
am O
beginning O
to O
improve O
in O
speech O
and O
swallowing O
. O
but O
very O
slowly O
and O
I O
may O
never O
get O
back O
to O
where O
I O
was O
before O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
It O
has O
also O
affected B-Disease
my I-Disease
memory I-Disease
. O
Had O
Pfizer O
just O
mentioned O
in O
their O
precautions O
that O
Lipitor B-Drug
just O
might O
cause O
speech O
and O
swallowing B-Disease
problems I-Disease
, O
I O
would O
have O
stopped O
taking O
statin O
drugs O
6 O
months O
earlier O
and O
I O
would O
have O
been O
OK O
again O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
seem O
to O
have O
any O
side O
effects O
. O
Been O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
more O
than O
5 O
years O
now O

Have O
been O
to O
several O

I O
feel O
Lipitor B-Drug
has O
taken O
away O
my O
life O
. O

I O
gradually O
lost O
my O
. O
This O
drug O
did O
amazing O
things O
with O
my O
chloresterol O
levels O
, O
it O
reduced O
it O
from O

Australian O
standards O
) O
7.5 O
to O
1.9 O
( O
generally O
considered O
OK O
level O
is O
5.4 O
) O
. O
However O
I O
gradually O
noticed O
that O
during O
the O
day O
I O
would O
get O
very B-Disease
tired I-Disease
, O
and O
have O
to O
sleep O
, O
and O
I O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O

driving O
for O
work O
, O
and O
also O
my O

( O
I O
` O

. O
Had O
numerous O
odd O

But O
since O

After O
several O
doctors O

they O
are O

that O
it O

The O
only O
good O

Gemfibrozil B-Drug
, O
as O
well O

This O
went O
on O
much O

long O
, O
mostly O
due O
to O
my O
inability O
to O
make O

due O

effects I-Disease
. O
After O

I O
was O

quick B-Disease
, I-Disease
sharp I-Disease
pain I-Disease
in I-Disease
center I-Disease
of I-Disease

followed O
by O
a O
hot/heated B-Disease
flushing I-Disease
sensation I-Disease
that I-Disease
began I-Disease
mid-torso I-Disease

continued I-Disease
up I-Disease

the I-Disease
top I-Disease
of I-Disease
head I-Disease
( I-Disease
top I-Disease

By O
the O
time O

it O
was O

a O
heart B-Disease

They O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
related O
to O
stress B-Disease
or O
a O
panic B-Disease

ridiculous O
because O
I O

amazing O

Had O
n't O
realised O
it O
was O

until O
I O
read O
this O
but O
I O
get O
the O
hunger B-Disease
pangs I-Disease
too O
, O
I O
'm O
assuming O
this O
is O
the O
acids O
and O
gas O
in O
your O
stomach O
constantly O
churning O
over O
that O
make O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
're O
hungry O
. O
I O
've O
taken O
co-codamol B-Drug
for O
my O
fibromyalgia B-Disease
for O
many O
years O
which O
I O
have O
very O
few O
side O
effects O
with O
. O
I O
've O
recently O
had O
this O
severe B-Disease
hip I-Disease
pain I-Disease
on O
both O
sides O
which O
the O
co B-Drug
codamol I-Drug
was O
n't O
touching O
so O
I O
went O
back O
to O
the O
Dr O
He O
recommended O
this O
anti-inflamatory O
and O
as O
he O
said O
next O
stop O
would O
be O
cortozone B-Drug
injections I-Drug
I O
was O
willing O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
. O
I O
've O
tried O
it O
for O
a O
week O
but O
it O
makes O
me O
feel B-Disease
dreadful I-Disease
. O
Every O
time O
I O
stand O
up O
I O
have O
to O
hold O
onto O
something O
for O
fear B-Disease
of I-Disease
falling I-Disease
over I-Disease
, O
I O
feel O
sick B-Disease
and O
light B-Disease
headed I-Disease
and O
I O
get O
those O
waves O
of O
nausea B-Disease
where O
you O
suddenly O
feel B-Disease
all I-Disease
clammy I-Disease
. O
It O
's O
very O
much O
like O
having O
a O
permanent B-Disease
hangover I-Disease
, O
even O
down O
to O
the O
hunger B-Disease
which O
until O
I O
read O
thsi O
site O
I O
had O
n't O
connected O
to O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
. O
I O
've O
felt O
no O
discernible O
difference O
in O
the O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
hips I-Disease
and O
the O
side O
effects O
simply O
are O
n't O
worth O
it O
so O
thats O
it O
for O
me O
and O
this O
drug O
. O

After O
taking O
the O
drug O
for O
7 O
years O
, O
i O
've O
suddenly O
developped O
diarrhea B-Disease
, O
nausea B-Disease
, O
loss B-Disease
of I-Disease
apetite I-Disease
, O
stomach O
cramps O
. O
I O
've O
had O
these O
symptoms O
for O
4 O
weeks O
and O
i O
've O
just O
realised O
it O
could O
be O
side O
effects O
from O
arthotec B-Drug
. O
The O
problem O
is O
if O
i O
stop O
arthrotec B-Drug
I O
become O
paralysed O
by O
back B-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O
Seeing O
the O
doctor O
next O
week O
. O
But O
not O
sure O
if O
my O
symptoms O
are O
due O
to O
the O
drug O
as O
i O
've O
been O
on O
it O
for O
so O
long O
with O
no O
side O
effects O
. O
After O
trying O
several O
NSAIDs O
with O
side O
effects O
, O
I O
finally O
discovered O
arthrotec B-Drug
which O
relieved O
the O
pain B-Disease
and O
no O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
usually O
take O
1 O
or O
2 O
a O
day O
and O
when O
the O
pain O
gets O
really O
bad O
increase O
it O
to O
3 O
a O
day O
for O
one O
or O
two O
weeks O
. O

For O
the O
first O
week O
I O
took O
one O
pill O
at O
bedtime O
, O
but O
then O
switched O
to O
mornings O
with O
breakfast O
. O
I O
experienced O
extreme B-Disease
uterine I-Disease
cramping I-Disease
within O
30 O
minutes O
of O
taking O
in O
the O
morning O
; O
I O
was O
in O
excruciating B-Disease
pain I-Disease
for O
an O
hour O
so O
I O
called O
an O
ambulance O
and O
was O
rushed O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
. O
Heavy B-Disease
bleeding I-Disease
started O
within O
30 O
minutes O
after O
the O
cramping B-Disease
ceased O
. O
Medical O
personnel O
dismissed O
the O
symptoms O
as O
not O
being O
related O
to O
taking O
this O
drug O
, O
but O
once O
I O
stopped O
taking O
, O
my O
cramping B-Disease
and O
bleeding B-Disease
stopped O
. O
Subsequent O
uterine O
& O
vaginal O
ultrasounds O
did O
not O
show O
anything O
else O
to O
be O
the O
cause O
. O
My O
OB/Gyn O
told O
me O
that O
she O
uses O
misoprostal B-Drug
( O
1 O
of O
the O
drugs O
in O
Arthrotec B-Drug
) O
for O
miscarriages O
& O
advised O
me O
to O
stop O
taking O
the O
drug O
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
to O
females O
. O
If O
you O
do O
take O
this O

my O

to O
relieve O
severe O
shoulder B-Disease

which O
I O
extended O
to O
ten O

when O
I O
noticed O
an O
amazing O
improvement O
in O
my O
general O
well-being O
and O
after O
the O
ten O
days O
felt O
so O
much O
better O
I O
stopped O

it O
altogether O
. O
For O
those O
who O
feel O
a O
long O
life O
is O
preferable O
to O
a O
good O

, O
this O

may O
be O
worth O
taking O
; O
for O
those O
who O
have O
enjoyed O
life O
and O
would O
prefer O
a O
slightly O
shorter O
one O
to O
a O
longer O
miserable O
one O
, O
stopping O
it O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
idea O

I O

for O
almost O
3 O
years O
and O
still O
have O
some O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
this O
is O
a O
very O
bad O
drug O
for O
some O
people O
. O

Particularly O
diahrea B-Disease
! O
Many O
unscheduled O
washroom O
stops O
over O
the O
time O
I O
've O
taken O
this O
medication O

Lately O
ankle B-Disease
swelling I-Disease
and O
lower B-Disease
tendon I-Disease
pain I-Disease
that O
was O
not O
experienced O
previously O
. O
Males O
tend O
to O
tolerate O
this O
medication O
better O
than O
women O
from O
my O
observation O
. O
This O
medication O
helped O
get O
me O
back O
to O
work O
and O
achieve O
tolerable O
pain B-Disease
levels O
and O
mobility B-Disease
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
for O
4 O
days O
and O
the O
pain B-Disease
returned O
. O
Currently O
take O
one O
75mg O
dose O
2 O
hours O
before O
work O
and O
seems O
to O
be O
enough O
to O
ease O
my O
particular O
condition O
. O
Probably O
alright O
for O
otherwise O
healthy O
individuals O
but O
those O
with O
other O
medical O
problems O
should O
probably O
avoid O
it O
. O
It O
will O
most O
likely O
exacerbate O
there O
ill O
health O
with O
unwelcome O
side O

This O
is O
the O
only O
NSAID O
I O
've O
ever O
taken O
that O
gave O
me O
discernable O
relief O
within O
90 O
minutes O
of O
taking O
it O
. O
Gastrointestinal B-Disease
problems I-Disease
were O
due O
largely O
to O
my O
taking O
the O
drug O
too O
close O
together O
, O
or O
after O
having O
consumed O
large O
amounts O
of O
alcohol O
. O

Mild B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
burning B-Disease
. O
My O
symptoms O
grew O
dramatically O
worse O
after O
adding O
Tricor B-Drug
145mg O
on O
advice O
of O
physician O
. O
Took O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
about O
8 O
years O
to O
reduce O
cholesterol O
from O
240 O
to O
160 O
. O
On O
advice O
of O
physician O
added O
Tricor B-Drug
145mg O
to O
reduce O
trigycerides O
from O
330 O
. O
Combination O
was O
very O
effective O
- O
cholesterol O
to O
140 O
, O
triglycerides O
to O
150 O
. O
Side O
effects O
increased O
noticeably O
a O
few O
months O
after O
starting O
tricor B-Drug
. O
About O
4 O
months O
after O
starting O
tricor B-Drug
, O
spent O
a O
day O
of O
heavy O
physical O
exertion O
( O
shoveling O
snow O
) O
. O
Immediately O
afterward O
side O
effects O
increased O
dramatically O
, O
severe B-Disease

pain I-Disease
, O
burning B-Disease
, O
cramps B-Disease
, O
exhaustion B-Disease
, O
mild B-Disease
nausea I-Disease
, O
inability B-Disease
to I-Disease
concentrate I-Disease
. O
After O
two O
weeks O
of O
decline O
, O
contacted O
physician O
, O
who O
directed O
me O
to O
stop O
both O
medications O
. O
One O
week O
after O
cessation O
and O
I O
am O
starting O
to O
feel O
a O
little O
better O
. O
Belatedly O
reading O
on O
the O
web O
about O
this O
combination O
( O
I O
was O
never O
informed O
that O
physical O
exertion O
can O
bring O
on O
these O
side O
effects O
) O
I O
recommend O
extreme O
caution O
with O
this O
combination O
. O

None O
whatsoever O
. O
Cholesterol O
dropped O
from O

( O
January O

Left O
shoulder O

and O
right O
hip O
and O
muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
over O
3 O
weeks O
. O
I O
'm O
a O
physician O
and O
initially O
figured O
the O
pain B-Disease
was O
sports O
related O
( O
although O
being O
right O
handed O
, O
I O
was O
suspicious O
about O
the O
unilateral O
left O
shoulder B-Disease
pain I-Disease
) O
. O
I O
stuck O
it O
out O
for O
3 O
weeks O
until O
I O
had O
a O
significant B-Disease
limp I-Disease
. O
Then O
stopped O
Lipitor B-Drug
3 O
days O
ago O
and O
noticed O
a O
very O
significant O

Doctor O
gave O
me O
a O
prescription O
for O
a O
year O
's O
worth O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
I O
took O
it O
for O
four O
months O
and O
asked O
for O
a O
retest O
before O
renewing O
my O
prescription O
. O
In O
four O
months O
, O
my O
cholesterol O
dropped O
100 O
points O
, O
HDL O
and O
LDL O
were O
in O
better O
, O
though O
not O
perfect O
balance O
. O
With O
my O
cholesterol O
at O
139 O
, O
I O
declined O
to O
take O
more O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
Got O
HDL O
and O
LDL O
into O
perfect O
balance O
within O
another O
two O
months O
using O
certain O
over-the-counter O
amino O
acids O
, O
tocotrienols O
, O
and O
other O
nutrients O
I O
found O
online O
that O
supposedly O
do O
the O
job O
. O
They O
do O
! O
And O
the O
nice O
thing O
is O
, O
if O
my O
cholesterol O
goes O
up O
again O
, O
I O
know O
that O
very O
low O
dose O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
will O
take O
care O
of O
it O
. O
Good O
stuff O
! O
. O

I O

almost O

I O
had O

else O

I O
attribute O

Why O
is O
there O
such O
denial O
as O
to O
the O

these O

a O

two O

before O
I O

the O

Wondering O

Lipitor B-Drug
does O
help O

considerably O
in O
many O
patients O
but O
the O
side O
effects O
of O
this O
'poisonous O
' O
medication O
are O
extremely O
alarming O
. O
I O
fail O
to O
comprehend O
why O
this O
medication O
is O
still O
permitted O
to O
be O
on O
the O
market O
as O
there O
is O
evidence O
that O
those O
who O
have O
been O
on O
long O

have O
suffered O
irreversible B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
damage I-Disease
plus O
other O

How O
come O
no O
one O
has O
sued O
the O

yet O
? O
Do O
patients O
have O
to O
die O
first O
before O
a O
pharmaceutical O
entity O
can O
be O
sued O
? O
Surely O
some O
of O
the O
people O
who O

should O
get O

institute O

The O

this O

works O
like O
a O

. O
no O
side O
effects O
and O
it O
does O
its O
job O
. O
my O
cholesterol O
has O
been O
lowered O
substantially O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
sure O
if O
this O
is O
related O
to O
the O
lipitor B-Drug
, O
but O
shortly O
after O
I O
started O
taking O
it O
, O
I O
exprienced O
complete O
paralysis B-Disease
in O
my O
forehead O
( O
peripheral B-Disease
neuropathy I-Disease
) O
. O
Went O
to O
a O
neurologist O
, O
GP O
and O
ENT O
, O
none O
of O
whom O
have O
ever O
seen O
this O
kind O
of O
paralysis B-Disease
( O
both O
sides O
) O
with O
no O
other O
symptoms O
. O
Has O
any O
one O
else O
come O
across O
this O
symptom O
? O
I O
m O
tempted O
to O
go O
off O
the O
medicine O
to O
see O
if O
the O
paralysis B-Disease
goes O
away O
. O
It O
really O
lowered O
my O
cholestrol O
a O
lot O
, O
so O
I O
hope O
this O
problem O
isn O
; O
t O
related O
. O

Gradual O
numbing O
of O
the O
feet O
over O
a O
period O
of O
a O
year O
. O
Started O
on O
Zocor B-Drug
and O
Insurance O
recommended O
switch O
to O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
had O
gradual O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
'm O
back O
on O
Zocor B-Drug
and O
doing O
much O
better O
after O
a O
week O
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O

none O
I O
can O
attribute O
directly O
to O
the O
medication O
. O
One O
must O
follow O
liver O
function O
tests O
( O
e.g O
. O
SGOT O
, O
SGPT O
) O
to O
insure O
no O
significant O
injury O
to O
liver O
cells O
. O

It O
's O
not O
clear O
that O
there O
were O
any O
. O
I O
'm O
concerned O
that O
I O
'm O
imagining O
them O
because O
of O
the O
long O
list O
of O
potential O
side O
effects O
. O
Medicine O
is O
scary O
, O
but O
it O
's O
sure O
working O
. O
This O
drug O
was O
prescribed O
to O
help O
with O
severe B-Disease
knee I-Disease
pain I-Disease
while O
I O
wait O
for O
additional O
diagnostics O
and O
possibly O
surgery O
after O
1/1 O
( O
due O
to O
high O
deductible O
on O
health O
insurance O
) O
. O
Pain O
was O
bad O
enough O
that O
I B-Disease
had I-Disease
trouble I-Disease
standing I-Disease
up I-Disease
from I-Disease
sitting I-Disease
position I-Disease
. O
After O
about O
24 O
hours O
, O
the O
pain O
was O
essentially O
gone O
and O
has O
stayed O
gone O
so O
far O
. O

Weak B-Disease
muscles I-Disease
. O
Achey O
like O
when O
you O
have O
a O
very O
high O
fever O
, O
only O
without O
the O
fever O
. O
Elevated O
white O
blood O
cell O
count O
( O
very O
high O
) O
, O
but O
liver O
emzymes O
were O
normal O
. O
I O
was O
on O
lowest O
dose O
. O
My O
LDL O
started O
at O
90 O
, O
but O
MD O
insisted O
that O
because O
I O
am O
diabetic B-Disease
, O
I O
should O
be O
on O
lipitor B-Drug
and O
try O
to O
get O
below O
70 O
. O
Lipitor B-Drug
knocked O
it O
down O
to O
25 O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
problems O
were O
due O
to O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
or O
having O
LDL O
down O
to O
25 O
. O
I O
asked O
MD O
he O
stated O
They O
( O
whomever O
they O
are O
) O
, O
have O
not O
established O
a O
low O
threshold O
for O
what O
is O
safe O
. O
I O
stated O
that O
just O
because O
it O
has O
not O
been O
proven O
in O
a O
lab O
, O
does O
not O
mean O
it O
is O
not O
true O
. O
I O
went O
off O
the O
meds O
, O
and O
am O
now O
in O
search O
of O
a O
new O
MD O
, O
as O
I O
have O
felt O
worse O
under O
this O
DR O
care O
than O
ever O
before O
in O
my O
life O
. O

Severe B-Disease
leg I-Disease
muscle I-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
leg B-Disease
cramping I-Disease
which O
started O
gradually O
and O
within O
four O
weeks O
interfered O
with O
my O
ability O
to O
drive O
because O
of O
calf B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
cramping I-Disease
. O
I O
have O
been O
informed O
by O
my O
doctor O
that O
my O
LDL O
was O
much O
improved O
over O
the O
short O
period O
while O
I O
was O
on O
the O
drug O
. O
However O
, O
this O
drug O
has O
caused O
a O
major O
change O
in O
my O
life O
style O
. O
Although O
I O
stopped O
this O
drug O
three O
months O
ago O
and O
I O
was O
assured O
the O
leg B-Disease
pain I-Disease
would O
resolve O
, O
I O
have O
been O
unable O
to O
function O
because O
of O
the O
continuous O
leg B-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
discomfort B-Disease
. O
I O
was O
on O
10mg O
a O
day O
and O
was O
informed O
that O
this O
was O
a O
low O
dose O
. O
The O
result O
of O
taking O
this O
drug O
has O
seriously O
impaired B-Disease
my I-Disease
ability I-Disease
to I-Disease
take I-Disease
long I-Disease
walks I-Disease
or O
exercise O
in O
general O
since O
to O
do O
so O
causes O
the O
leg B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
pain I-Disease
to O
flair O
up O
. O
Although O
I O
have O
been O
assured O
that O
this O
will O
resolve O
, O
I O
have O
been O
off O
the O
drug O
for O
3 O
months O
and O
have O
only O
experienced O
a O
modicum O
of O
improvement O
. O

Within O
a O
week O
or O
two O
of O
taking O
the O
prescribe O
dose O
, O
I O
began O
developing O
something O
I O
never O
had O
before O
: O
eczema B-Disease
. O
It O
became O
progressively O
worse O
, O
and O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
first O
month O
had O
created O
a O
massive B-Disease
triangular I-Disease
rash I-Disease
on I-Disease
my I-Disease
forehead I-Disease
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
patch B-Disease
on I-Disease
one I-Disease
cheek I-Disease
. O
The O
skin B-Disease
was I-Disease
very I-Disease
red I-Disease
and I-Disease
rough I-Disease
, O
and O
made O
public O
life O
miserable O
and O
embarassing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
the O
rash B-Disease
cleared O
up O
greatly O
, O
but O
has O
NEVER O
gone O
away O
completly O
, O
flaring O
up O
slightly O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
but O
not O
nearly O
as O
bad O
as O
it O
was O
during O
dosing O
with O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
I O
was O
not O
taking O
any O
other O
medications O
at O
the O
time O
, O
and O
never O
had O
eczema B-Disease
before O
. O
The O
anti-lipid O
effect O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
was O
unusually O
strong O
in O
my O
case O
, O
causing O
my O
CHO O
to O
drop O
below O
90 O
( O
from O
a O
baseline O
of O
over O
200 O
) O
. O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
first O
2 O
weeks O
of O
dosing O
, O
my O
physician O
had O
me O
cutting O
the O
smallest O
dose O
tablet O
in O
half O
to O
be O
taken O
once O
a O
day O
. O
Even O
so O
, O
the O
rash B-Disease
continued O
to O
enlarge O
and O
get O
worse O
, O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
stop O
taking O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O

aching O
joints O
: O
wrists O
, O
elbows O
, O
shoulders O
, O
knees O
, O
and O
gas B-Disease
. O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
i O
can O
not O
sleep O
through O
the O
night O
. O

First O
of O
all O
, O
I O
noticed O
severe B-Disease
lower I-Disease
back I-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O
I O
put O
this O
off O
as O
a O
work-out O
related O
pain B-Disease
. O
After O
the O
pain B-Disease
intensified O
after O
it O
should O
have O
gone O
away O
, O
I O
became O
concerned O
. O
Then O
I O
noticed O
that O
my O
knee O
and O
my O
right O
hip B-Disease
hurt I-Disease
. O
Then O
I O
started O
crying B-Disease
for I-Disease
no I-Disease
reason I-Disease
. O
I O
yelled O
at O
my O
poor O
dog O
for O
doing O
nothing O
. O
ALl O
in O
all O
, O
this O
drug O
really O
sucks O
. O
I O
hate O
it O
. O
I O
hate O
the O
doctor O
that O
put O
me O
on O
it O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
wait O
to O
get O
off O
of O
it O
. O
I O
should O
n't O
have O
been O
on O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O
I O
swear O
she O
must O
be O
doing O
it O
for O
the O
drug O
compant O
kick O
backs O
. O

For O
the O
past O
year O
and O

just O
took O
the O

about O
30 O
minutes O

the O
worst O
abdominal B-Disease
pain I-Disease
ever O
, O
like O
mentstrual B-Disease

/ O
diarreah B-Disease
cramping I-Disease
combined O
. O
i O
had O
to O
keep O
dropping O
into O
a O
crouched O
position O
due O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
the O
lower B-Disease
abdominal I-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O
i O
was O
put O
on O
this O
medication O
because O
i O
was O
taking O
such O
high O
doses O
of O
Advil B-Drug
to O
quell O
the O
inflammation B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
neck I-Disease

back O

that O
it O
caused O
me O
to O
have O
a O
GI B-Disease
bleed I-Disease
. O
but O
after O
this O
little O
episode O
, O
and O
after O
reading O
that O
it O
can O
cause O

i O
highly O

this O

is O
the O
best O
fit O
for O
my O
problem O
! O
! O
i O
already O
have O
anemia B-Disease

of O
this O
? O

I O
have O
been O
on O
this O
medication O
for O
approximately O
two O
years O
and O
it O
has O
been O
very O
affective O
in O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
; O
however O
, O
I O
did O
notice O
that O
I O
became O
depressed B-Disease
with O
intermittent O
muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O
I O
recently O
mentioned O
this O
to O
my O
physician O
and O
asked O
if O
he O
knew O
if O
this O
particular O
medication O
causes O
these O
symptoms O
as O
all O
my O
blood O
studies O
for O
liver O
function O
, O
etc O
have O
been O
normal O
. O
I O
decided O
to O
stop O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
within O
a O
few O
days O
I O
felt O
so O
much O
better O
. O
I O
will O
call O
him O
tomorrow O
and O
ask O
if O
I O
can O
be O
switched O
to O
another O
medication O
. O
It O
is O
a O
very O
effective O
medication O
, O
but O
obviously O
has O
its O
problems O
as O
indicated O
by O
those O
patients O
who O
had O
very O
similar O
effects O
. O

OK O
for O
4 O

but O
a O
month O
later O
started O
going O

again O

have O
now O

with O
ALS B-Disease

I O
am O
an O
unlikely O
candidate O
for O
MND B-Disease
. O
I O
know O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
poisoned O
me O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
stopped O
taking O
this O
poison O
before O
it O
caused O
permanent B-Disease
nerve I-Disease

The O
week O
I O
started O
to O
take O
I O
had O
the O
chest B-Disease
ache I-Disease
, O
confirmed O
to O
be O
muscular O
by O
doctors O
. O
At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
second O
week O
, O
I O
accidentally O
took O
a O
dose O
in O
the O
morning O
instead O
of O
the O
night O
because O
I O
took O
the O
wrong O
pill O
( O
skipped O
the O
night O
dose O
) O
. O
The O
day O
after O
I O
started O
to O
have O
the O
other O
symptons O
. O
The O
worst O
one O
- O
the O
mouth O
one O
has O
faded O
, O
but O
the O
others O
remain O
. O
I O
found O
out O
too O
late O
grapefruit O
juice O
can O
make O
this O
drug O
stronger O
. O
I O
drank O
it O
some O
days O
during O
the O
first O
2 O
weeks O
. O
Stopped O
drinking O
it O
. O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
third O
week O
I O
took O
50mg O
of O
CoQ10 B-Drug
per O
day O
for O
3 O
days O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
sense O
an O
improvement O
, O
but O
after O
stopping O
for O
other O
three O
days O
I O
will O
try O
again O
. O
( O
I O
need O
better O
evidence O
before O
buying O
a O
can O
of O
CoQ10 B-Drug
, O
it O
is O
very O
expensive O
and O
hard O
to O
find O
around O
here O
) O
. O
Will O
beg O
my O
cardiologist O
to O
let O
me O
try O
natural O
exercise O
before O
continuing O
statins O
. O
Giving O
it O
a O
3 O
, O
because O
it O
was O
effective O
, O
in O
a O
single O
month O
and O
with O
ezetimibe B-Drug
and O
exercise O
all O
my O
numbers O
are O
in O
very O
safe O
ranges O
. O
Please O
be O
careful O
about O
natural O
supplements O
. O
Homeopathy O
simply O
does O
not O
work O
- O
it O
is O
just O
water O
- O
The O
supplements O
that O
do O
work O
may O
also O
have O
side O
effects O
, O
just O
like O
the O
drugs O
. O
Red O
Yeast O
Rice O
, O
for O
example O
, O
actually O
contains O
a O
statin O
( O
lovastatin B-Drug
) O
, O
so O
it O
will O
most O
likely O
have O
all O
the O
set O
of O
side O
effects O
as O
the O
other O
statins O
. O

After O

me O
try O

although O
my O
cholesterol O
level O
was O
only O
205 O
. O
I O
told O
her O
about O

thought O
I O
would O
do O
ok O
on O
it O
. O
I O
even O
questioned O
her O
about O
the O
liver B-Disease
damage I-Disease
it O
can O
cause O

she O
said O
it O
hardly O
ever O
happens O
. O
In O
less O
than O
two O
weeks O
I O
was O
so O
hyperactive B-Disease
I O
thought O
I O
was O
going O
crazy O
. O
I O
worked O
overnight O
at O
my O
job O
and O
I O
was O
trying O
to O
do O
things O
so O
fast O
that O
I O
would O
frustrate O
myself O
. O
My O
brain O
also O
felt O
like O
it O
was O
kicked O
into O
high O
gear O
as O
if O
I O
was O
on O
constant B-Disease
alert I-Disease
for O
something O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
after O
two O
weeks O
and O
told O
my O
doctor O
. O
She O
said O
if O
it O
was O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
she O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
that O
happening O
to O
anyone O
before O
and O
recommended O
I O
continue O
its O
' O
use O
. O
I O
stopped O
and O
now O
refuse O
to O
use O
it O
. O
At O
my O
last O
physical O
she O
said O
she O
was O
happy O
that O
I O
was O
so O
healthy O

DID O
READ O
THEM O
. O

Lipitor B-Drug
reduced O
my O
readings O
to O
almost O
normal O
. O
At O
the O
same O
time O
I O
suffered O
from O
fibromyalgia B-Disease
. O
The O
pain O
all O
over O
my O
body O
got O
worse O
as O
time O
went O
on O
. O
I O
noticed O
that O
when O
I O
left O
my O
Lipitor B-Drug
at O
home O
when O
I O
was O
on O
vacation O
or O
other O
trip O
, O
that O
I O
began O
to O
feel O
better O
. O
My O
doctor O
told O
me O
there O
was O
a O
remote O
possibility O
that O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
was O
agravating O
the O
fibromyalgia B-Disease
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
feel O
so O
much O
better O
! O
But O
, O
it O
seems O
I O
buggered O
up O
my O
stomach O
from O
all O
the O
pain O
killers O
that O
I O
took O
. O
What O
to O
do O
next O
? O
. O
Please O
be O
carefull O
with O
this O
drug O
and O
watch O
for O
all O
types O
of O
body B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
. O

I O
had O
been O
taking O
two O
tablets O
per O
day O
( O
one O
@ O
breakfast O
time O
, O
the O
other O
@ O
dinner O
time O
) O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
when O
I O
was O
alerted O
to O
possible O
long O
term O
side O
effects O
& O
then O
consulted O
my O
GP O
who O
advised O
because O
of O
the O
time O
I O
had O
been O
taking O
them O
to O
only O
take O
them O
on O
a O
`` O
need O
to O
basis O
'' O
. O
I O
immediately O
stopped O
completely O
but O
found O
that O
I O
had O
muscular B-Disease
pains I-Disease
all O
over O
my O
body O
, O
I O
have O
now O
reduced O
my O
intake O
to O
one O
per O
day O
@ O
breakfast O
time O
& O
find O
that O
this O
has O
proved O
a O
moderately O
succesful O
outcome O
. O

Extreme B-Disease
fatigue I-Disease
, O
headaches B-Disease
, O
cramping B-Disease
in I-Disease
both I-Disease

, O
memory B-Disease
problems I-Disease
, O
like B-Disease
Im I-Disease
in I-Disease
a I-Disease

all I-Disease
the I-Disease
time I-Disease
. O
Dr O
has O
taken O
me O
off O
the O
drug O
. O
Previously O
I O
have O
taken O
ZOCOR B-Drug
and O
MEVACOR B-Drug
with O
similar O
results O
, O
but O
not O
has O
pronounced O
as O
with O
LIPITOR B-Drug
. O
Find O
another O
way O
to O
reduce O
blood O
cholesterol O
. O

pain B-Disease
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
had O
sever B-Disease
arthritic I-Disease
condition I-Disease
. O
even O
tried O
two O
times O
per O
week O
with O
same O
results O
. O
tried O
other O
statins O
with O
same O
side O
effect O
. O
presently O
on O
crestor B-Drug
one O
time O
per O
week O
with O
occasional O
side O
effect O
of O
mild B-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O
MD O
said O
one O
time O
a O
week O
can O
be O
very O
effective O
for O
patients O
that O
have O
reaction O
to O
statins O
. O
Have O
not O
had O
bloodwork O
as O
yet O
to O
see O
if O
helped O
. O

It O
did O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
I O
became O
so O
depressed B-Disease
that O
I O
called O
my O
doctor O
and O
told O
her O
I O
refused O
to O
take O
it O
anymore O
. O
I O
think O
this O
effect O
may O
have O
been O
caused O
by O
an O
interaction O
with O
the O
birth B-Drug
control I-Drug
pill I-Drug
. O
it O
lowered O
my O
numbers O
, O
but O
made O
my O
life O
miserable O
. O

Numbness O
started O
in O
left O
toe O
& O
went O
to O
right O
toe O
then O
went O
to O
all O
toes O
. O
Burning B-Disease
feet I-Disease
especially O
at O
night O
. O
I O
was O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
about O
2 O
years O
when O
this O
started O
. O
It O
went O
to O
all O
of O
my O
feet O
. O
My O
dr O
wanted O
to O
keep O
me O
on O
lipitor B-Drug
but O
when O
I O
quit O
taking O
I O
got O
better O
gradually O
. O
I O
really O
had O
to O
fight O
my O
dr O
to O
get O
him O
to O
believe O
that O
lipitor B-Drug
was O
causing O
this O
. O
He O
put O
me O
on O
another O
statin O
after O
a O
month O
of O
not O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
the O
same O
thing O
started O
to O
happen O
. O
I O
am O
now O
taking O
herbs O
for O
my O
cholesterol O
and O
it O
is O
still O
high O
but O
going O
lower O
and O
my O
feet O
are O
doing O
better O
. O
Drug O
co O
should O
inform O
doctors O
of O
these O
problems O
so O
they O
will O
understand O
them O
when O
their O
patients O
come O
to O
them O
for O
help O
and O
. O
I O
found O
that O
all O
statins O
cause O
this O
problem O
and O
the O
drug O
companies O
should O
help O
rather O
than O
hide O
the O
problems O
. O

Lots O
of O
stomach O
gurgling O

, O
which O
has O
been O
consistent O
even O
after O
adjusting O
to O
the O
medication O
, O
and O
initial O
doses O
gave O
diarrhea B-Disease
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O
I O
have O
switched O
to O
taking O
it O
with O
a O
snack O
before O
bedtime O
with O
good O
results O
. O
For O
me O
, O
it O
has O
been O
very O
effective O
pain O
relief O
for O
my O
chronic B-Disease
bone/joint I-Disease
pain I-Disease
from O
a O
broken O
elbow O
. O
So O
effective O
that O
I O
was O
able O
to O
substantially O
reduce O
the O
amount O
of O
narcotic O
pain O
reliever O
I O
was O
using O
once O
the O
Voltaren B-Drug

about O
2 O

either O
. O
I O

I O
'd O
been O

many O
times O
before O
but O
this O
I O
could O
n't O
work O
out O
witch O
door O
to O

out O
( O
I O
think O
it O
also O
has O
an O
effect B-Disease
on I-Disease
your I-Disease
memory I-Disease
) O
. O
Also O
I O
suffer O
badly O
from O

. O
My O

not O

I O
just O
wish O
the O
doctors O
would O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
side O
affects O
to O
expect O
. O

Initially O
there O
were O
no O
side O
effects O
. O
It O
took O
the O
better O
part O
of O
two O

them O
to O
start O

During O
that O
time O
, O
my O

But O
then O
, O
very O
gradually O

My O

the O

was O
very O
embarrasing O
for O

The O

At O
the O

I O
did O
not O
had O
any O
side O
effects O
, O
until O
a O
few O
months O
after O
start O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
I O
experienced O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
the I-Disease
lower I-Disease
legs I-Disease
, O
sometimes O
I O
could O
not O
even O
walk O
in O
the O
mornings O
my O
muscles B-Disease
were I-Disease
very I-Disease
stiff I-Disease
. O
After O
consulting O
with O
my O
doctor O
he O
told O
me O
to O
stop O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
until O
the O
pain B-Disease
went O
away O
and O
to O
start O
taking O
it O
after O
the O
pain B-Disease
was O
gone O
. O
I O
followed O
the O

After O
a O

in I-Disease
the I-Disease

in I-Disease
the I-Disease

area I-Disease
, O
upper O
back O

, O
the O
pain O

of O
my O

was O
so O
bad O
that O
sometimes O
I O
could O
n't O
even O
turn O
my O
head O
when O
I O
was O
driving O
. O
I O
went O
to O
my O

thought O
it O
was O
stress B-Disease
. O
I O
took O
off O
work O
for O
a O
month O
and O
during O
this O
time O
I O
tried O
to O
relax O
and O
the O
pain O
did O
not O
go O
away O
. O
I O
decided O
to O
be O
off O
Lipitor B-Drug
on O
my O
own O
and O
within O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
the O

from O
the O

and O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
the I-Disease
shoulder I-Disease
and O
back O
is O
going O
away O
, O
I O
feel O
much O
better O
now O
that O
I O
am O
not O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
I O
do O
not O
think O
I O
will O
take O
Lipitor B-Drug
ever O
again O
, O
the O
problems O
that O
have O
been O
causing O
me O
are O
too O
much O
to O
risk O
my O
health O
again O
. O
I O
will O
look O

alternatives O
ways O
of O
reducing O
my O

THIS O
DAY O
AFTER O
BEING O
OFF O
THE O
DRUG O
FOR O
ALMOST O
A O
YEAR O
. O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
THIS O
DRUG O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
. O
I O
was O
put O
on O
this O
drug O
by O
my O
doctor O
for O
my O
somewhat O
high B-Disease
cholesterol I-Disease
. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
after O
starting O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
suddenly O
felt B-Disease
like I-Disease
I I-Disease
had I-Disease
aged I-Disease
to I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old I-Disease
overnight I-Disease
but O
did O
not O
connect O
it O
to O
starting O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
feeling B-Disease
all I-Disease
that I-Disease
age I-Disease
caught I-Disease
up I-Disease
with I-Disease
you I-Disease
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
I B-Disease
was I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old I-Disease
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
hypochondriac B-Disease
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
eighty B-Disease
years I-Disease
old I-Disease
feeling I-Disease
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O
pill O
can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O
recovering O
like O
I O
did O
the O
first O
time O
. O
This O
has O
ruined O
my O
life O
and O
I O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
Lipitor B-Drug
if O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
know O
now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O
permanent O
damage O
. O
My O
doctor O
, O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
this O
, O
wanted O
to O
change O
statins O
because O
he O
was O
still O
worried O
about O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
I O
told O
him O
no O
more O
statins O
and O
he O
then O
prescribed O
Zetia B-Drug
, O
which O
he O
said O
was O
was O
less O
effective O
but O
was O
not O
a O
statin O
, O
which O
I O
am O
still O
afraid O
to O
take O
unless O
I O
improve O
from O
the O
affects O
of O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
He O
told O
me O
he O
was O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
himself O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problems O
but O
then O
said O
, O
well O
he O
did O
have O
neck B-Disease
pains I-Disease
that O
could O
have O
been O
a O
side O
affect O
, O
but O
that O
he O
had O
been O
on O
the O
drug O
two O
years O
before O
this O
developed O
. O
I O
told O
him O
of O
the O
information O
on O
this O
site O
that O
describes O
some O
people O
having O
that O
delayed O
reaction O
and O
I O
advised O
him O
to O
take O
himself O
off O
of O
this O
drug O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
the O
neck O

cleared O
up O

I O
advise O
, O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
THIS O
DRUG O

20mg O
dose O

months O
, O
if O
something O
happens O
sooner O
I O
'll O
stop O
before O
the O
two O
months O
are O
up O
. O
What O
I O
am O
reading O
is O
that O
most O
doctors O
are O
NOT O
prescribing O
conservative O
dosages O
- O
maybe O
take O
that O
back O
to O
them O
the O
next O
appointment O
? O
Eh O
? O
My O
first O
night O
- O
the O
soundest O
sleep O
in O
over O
four O
years O
! O
without O

killers O
for O
the O
constant O
trigeminal B-Disease
neuralgis I-Disease
( O
a O
side O
benefit O
to O
be O
sure O
) O
. O
Not O
happy O
about O
the O
idea O
of O
statins O
- O
strange B-Disease
psychic I-Disease
events I-Disease
when O
my O
mother O
was O
taking O
them O
( O
Zocor B-Drug
) O
- O
too O
strange O
to O
repeat O
in O
a O
public O
forum O
. O
So O
I O
am O
here O
looking O
for O
information O
about O
the O
side O
effects O
- O
anecdotally O
presented O
- O
as O
the O
web O
site O
for O
Lipitor B-Drug
does O
not O
have O
the O
information O
that O
would O
typically O
come O
on O
the O
drug O
sheet O
. O
If O
anyone O
knows O
of O
a O
site O
that O
has O
the O
real O
skinny O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
's O
effects O
- O
please O
pass O
it O
along O
. O
Much O
appreciated O
! O
. O

muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O

Was O
on O
Provachol O
. O
Dr O
switched O
me O
to O
Lipitor B-Drug
since O
he O
said O
it O
was O
more O
effective O
. O
After O
78 O
days O
on O
Lipitor O
, O
I O
had O
constant B-Disease
low I-Disease
level I-Disease
pain I-Disease
in O
my O
butt O
and O
upper O
thighs O
. O
Strong B-Disease
pain I-Disease
would O
come O
and O
go O
randomly O
. O
There O
would O
be O
spikes B-Disease
of I-Disease
pain I-Disease
so I-Disease
severe I-Disease
that O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
would O
collapse O
. O
Would O
have O
to O
stop O
standing/walking O
and O
sit O
down O
for O
5 O
or O
10 O
minutes O
. O
After O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
the O
pain B-Disease
gradually O
subsided O
over O
a O
9 O
month O
period O
. O
I O
was O
pain B-Disease
free O
for O
a O
few O
months O
, O
but O
the O
same O
pain B-Disease
has O
returned O
and O
has O
been O
with O
me O
for O
the O
past O
5 O
months O
. O
I O
now O
wonder O
if O
this O
is O
a O
chronic B-Disease
pain I-Disease
condition I-Disease
. O

I O
took O
one O
dose O
and O
15 O
minutes O
later O
i O
felt O
dizzy B-Disease
and O
had O
chest B-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
felt O
like O
my O
life O
was O
gon O
na O
slip O
away O
and O
die O
. O
i O
called O
my O
Dr O
and O
he O
is O
an O
idiot O
. O
he O
told O
me O
that O
this O
medicine O
does O
not O
cause O
these O
symptoms O
I O
hate O
when O
Pharmecitical O
company O
push O
these O
and O
have O
DR O
's O
advertise O
and O
experiment O
on O
us O
like O
animals O
they O
jsut O
make O
us O
sicker O
. O

The O
symptoms O
got O
progressively O
worse O
with O
time O
. O
They O
included O
fluid B-Disease
retention I-Disease
, O
all O
over O
muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
cramps B-Disease
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
them O
a O
week O
ago O
and O
felt O
much O
better O
the O
next O
day O
. O
Some O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
have O
n't O
totally O
disappeared O
but O
I O
'm O
improving O
with O
each O
day O
. O
My O
doctor O
does O
n't O
believe O
that O
this O
medication O
could O
cause O
this O
reaction O
. O

No O
side O
effects O
. O
My O
doctor O
( O
conservative O
and O
top-rate O
) O
says O
that O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
is O
a O
no O
brainer O
. O
All O
advantages O
, O
no O
disadvantages O
. O
And O
for O
me O
that O
's O
true O
. O
My O
cholesterol O
fell O
to O
160 O
and O
I O
've O
had O
no O
side O
effects O
. O
My O
husband O
and O
I O

have O
been O
taking O
10mg O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug

. O
After O
1 O

I O
had O
severe O
diarrhoea B-Disease
which O

but O

treatment O
. O
I O
was O
puzzled O
! O
! O
Recently O
after O
walking O
for O
a O
while O
I O
experienced O
severe O
pain O
in O
my O
right O
leg O
from O
thigh O
to O
knee O
and O
then O
to O
ankle O
which O
caused B-Disease
me I-Disease
to I-Disease
limp I-Disease
. O
I O
found O
this O
website O
and O
I O
seem O
to O
have O
similar O
symtoms O
as O

take O
this O
medication O
. O

that O
went O
away O
after O
3 O
days O
off O
Lipitor B-Drug
) O
. O
I O
am O
scared O
of O
permanet O
damage O
. O
I O
really O
really O
hope O
it O
is O
reversible O
, O
because O
I O
ca B-Disease
n't I-Disease
walk I-Disease
or O
do O
anything O
with O
my O
hands O
. O

I O
have O
done O
very O
well O
with O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
the O
last O
2 O
1/2 O
years O
. O
It O
has O
reduced O
my O
cholesterol O
significantly-from O
over O
300 O
to O
under O
150 O
. O
Two O
weeks O
ago O
I O
was O
given O
the O
new O
generic O
. O
This O
week O
I O
noticed O
that O
all O
my O
fingers B-Disease
and I-Disease
toes I-Disease
were I-Disease
tingling I-Disease
, O
a O
pins B-Disease
and I-Disease
needles I-Disease
feeling I-Disease
. O
It O
was O
like O
they O
had O
fallen O
asleep O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
back O
to O
pharmacy O
and O
got O
brand O
name O
again O
( O
luckily O
my O
insurance O
pays-it O
will O
be O
$ O
15/ O
3 O
month O
supply O
more O
, O
but O
it O
's O
worth O
it O
) O
. O
I O
have O
noticed O
just O
within O
the O
last O
two O
days O
the O
tingling B-Disease
is O
gone O
. O
Thank O
goodness O
! O
I O
read O
that O
generics O
have O
the O
same O
active O
ingredients O
, O
but O
there O
may O
be O
a O
difference O
in O
how O
the O
medicine O
is O
released O
. O
It O
's O
not O
EXACTLY O
the O
same O
. O
High O
cholesterol O
runs O
in O
my O
family O
and O
I O
am O
greatful O
that O
Lipitor B-Drug
can O
help O
me O
manage O
this O
. O

After O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
several O
months O
, O
and O
gradually O
incrasing O
my O
dose O
to O
40mg O
, O
I O
started O
to O
get O
EXTREMELY O
fatigued O
. O
I O
had O
to O
take O
a O
nap O
every O
day O
for O
2 O
- O
3 O
hours O
. O
After O
discontinuing O
the O
medicine O
, O
my O
energy O
levels O
bounced O
back O
to O
normal O
. O
It O
really O
helped O
lower O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
have O
to O
wonder O
what O
it O
was O
doing O
to O
me O
to O
make B-Disease
me I-Disease
so I-Disease
tired I-Disease
. O

I O
experienced O
lightheadedness B-Disease
, O
depression B-Disease
, O
short B-Disease
term I-Disease
memory I-Disease
problems I-Disease
. O
The O
worst O
side O
effects O
by O
far O
were O
the O
severe B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
pains I-Disease
and O
cramps B-Disease
, O
especially O
in O
my O
shins O
, O
front O
of O
my O
thighs O
, O
feet O
and O
hands O
. O
I O
noticed O
that O
they O
usually O
began O
about O
an O
hour O
after O
taking O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
would O
continue O
for O
several O
hours O
into O
the O
night O
. O
I O
was O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
2 O
years O
when O
I O
noticed O
that O
on O
a O
day O
that O
I O
had O
forgotten O
to O
take O
it O
, O
that O
I O
did O
n't O
experience O
the O
severe B-Disease
pains I-Disease
. O
I O
experimented O
by O
taking O
the O
medication O
one O
night O
and O
then O
not O
taking O
it O
the O
next O
. O
Sure O
enough O
, O
every O
night O
I O
took O
the O
medication O
I O
had O
the O
severe B-Disease
cramps I-Disease
/ O
pains B-Disease
but O
the O
nights O
I O
did O
n't O
take O
it O
, O
either O
I O
did O
n't O
experience O
the O
pain B-Disease
at O
all O
or O
it O
was O
at O
a O
much O
lesser O
degree O
. O
After O
a O
few O
days O
, O
I O
stopped O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
a O
2 O
week O
period O
and O
noticed O
that O
all O
my O
symptoms O
improved O
and O
the O
muscle B-Disease
pains I-Disease
and O
cramps B-Disease
completely O
resolved O
. O
I O
notified O
my O
doctor O
. O
She O
stopped O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
suggested O
that O
I O
try O
Red B-Drug
Yeast I-Drug
Rice I-Drug
instead O
. O
It O
has O
given O
good O
results O
with O
no O

my O

. O
I O
could O
not O

12 O
weeks O
after O

I O
reported O
to O
my O
cardiologist O
and O
internist O
who O
both O
denied O
problems O
were O
related O
to O
Lipitor B-Drug
because O
my O

only O
mildly O

He O
said O
he O
sees O

around O
my O

It O
would O
last O

a O
few O
minutes O

a O

then O
fade O
away O
for O

I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
for O
a O
few O
days O
and O
tried O
it O
again O
with O
the O
same O
results O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
but O
it O
took O
at O
least O
a O
month O
for O
the O
muscle B-Disease
pains I-Disease
to O
stop O
completely O
. O
My O
doctor O
had O
me O
try O
2 O
or O
3 O
other O
similar O
medications O
before O
this O
one O
with O
the O
same O
results O
. O
When O
I O
told O
him O
that O
I O
was O
still O
getting O
the O
muscle B-Disease

occasionally O
a O
couple O
weeks O
after O
I O
stopped O

he O
said O
I O
was O

I O

heal O
an O

. O
The O
doctor O
did O
say O
to O
only O
take O
it O
5 O
days O
though O
because O
it O
reduces O
mucus O

According O
to O
my O
'GP O
' O
( O
Dr O
) O
, O
the O
UK O
male O
'desireable O
target O
' O
is O
5.1 O
mmol/litre O
or O
196 O
mg/decilitre O
. O
Docs O
now O
actually O
like O
you O
to O
be O
lower O
than O
that O
if O
possible O
. O
In O
1977 O
( O
at O
age O
28 O
) O
with O
a O
'count O
' O
of O
10mmol/L O
( O
385mg/dL O
) O
, O
a O
VERY O
careful O
low-chol O
. O
diet O
made O
virtually O
NO O
difference O
to O
my O
count O
. O
So O
I O
went O
onto O
Zocor B-Drug
( O
new-ish O
then O
) O
and O
remained O
on O
it O
for O
21 O
years O
, O
finally O
on O
a O
dose O
of O
40mg/day O
with O
no O
real O
side O
effects O
- O
it O
lowered O
my O
count O
to O
5.6mmol/L O
. O
As O
my O
count O
started O
to O
rise O
again O
to O
7.8 O
in O
1997 O
( O
at O
age O
48 O
) O
, O
I O
switched O
to O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
starting O
with O
20mg/day O
and O
then O
40mg/day O
which O
dropped O
my O
count O
A O
LOT O
to O
just O
5.1mmol/L O
and O
with O
an O
HDL O
'good O
cholesterol O
' O
count O
of O
1.6 O
. O
After O
a O
3-week O
holiday O
without O
pills O
, O
my O
count O
rose O
to O
10.4 O
, O
so O
I O
went O
back O
onto O
40mg/day O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
- O
but O
my O
count O
was O
still O
only O
6.7 O
, O
so O
I O
put O
myself O
onto O
80mg/day O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
my O
count O
went O
down O
to O
5.5 O
- O
this O
is O
the O

I O
quit O

3 O
months O
ago O
and O
still O
have O
not O
gotten O
any O
better O
. O
In O
the O
four O
years O
Ive O
been O
taking O
this O
medication O
noone O
has O
every O
told O
me O
about O
this O
side O
effect O
. O
I O
even O
went O
to O
the O
doctor O
and O
told O
him O
of O
all O
the O
pain B-Disease
and O
he O
said O
it O
could O
be O
arthrites B-Disease
. O
. O

Not O
much O
-- O
occasional O
itchiness B-Disease
. O
I O
was O
taking O
Red B-Drug
Yeast I-Drug
statins O
for O
chlolesterol O
of O
230 O
, O
but O
then O
big-pharma O
got O
in O
the O
picture O
and O
made O
that O
illegal O
. O
Do O
n't O
know O
if O
that O
is O
still O
the O
case O
. O
My O
doctor O
said O
Lipitor B-Drug
was O
the O
most O
tested O
statin O
drug O
. O
My O
real O
concern O
is O
heart B-Disease
disease I-Disease
which O
is O
in O
my O
family O
. O
Not O
sure O
of O
how O
tight O
the O
correlation O
is O
between O
low O
chlosterol O
numbers O
and O
low O
risk O
of O
coronary B-Disease
problems I-Disease
. O
AMA O
dumbs O
down O
the O
information O
to O
make O
is O
sound O
like O
getting O
down O
to O
ridiculous O
levels O
( O
100 O
) O
insures O
that O
you O
wo O
n't O
have O
problems O
. O
I O
doubt O
it O
. O
Probably O
much O
more O
based O
on O
genetic O
history O
. O
So O
Lipitor B-Drug
is O
great O
for O
reducing O
your O
numbers O
, O
but O
extending O
your O
life O
? O
? O
? O
. O

Has O
been O
all O
OK O
until O
recently O
when O
I O

As O
I O
had O
just O
recently O
had O
flu B-Drug

thought O
this O
was O
the O
cause O
. O
However O
the O
symptoms O
persisted O
, O
GP O
said O
`` O
just O
flu B-Drug

`` O
- O
but O
after O
4 O
weeks O
! O
Noticed O
today O
after O
leaving O

off O

a O

so O
, O
that O
things O
were O
much O

until O
I O

returned O
within O
a O

Draw O
your O

I O
did O

think O
I O
had O
any O

I O
started O
reading O
through O
some O
of O
the O

I O
thought O
it O

I O
too O

What O

There O

RR O
0.98 O

Thus O
the O

after O

about I-Disease

After O
being O
off O

this O
medication O
for O
only O
48 O
hours O
, O
I O
am O
already O
beginning O
to O
see O
an O
improvement O
in O
my O
moods O
, O
but O
this O
will O
be O
a O
long O
journey O
back O
to O
my O
old O
self O
, O
I O
feel O
. O
Oh O
yes O
, O
and O
I O
also O
suffered O
from O
: O
Gas B-Disease
, O
Constipation B-Disease
, O
EXTREME O
FATIGUE B-Disease
, O
weight B-Disease
gain I-Disease
and O
bloating B-Disease
, O
and O
occassional O
bouts O
of O
diaharrea B-Disease
. O
It O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
. O
But O
it O
also O
significantly O
lowered O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
This O
website O
has O
been O
an O
absolute O
lifeline O
for O
me O
. O
My O
doctor O
had O
seemed O
so O
completely O
unwilling O
to O
accept O
that O
my O
symptoms O
could O
've O
possibly O
been O
related O
to O
my O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
However O
, O
I O
know O
my O
body O
and O
know O
when O
things O
are O
not O
as O
they O
should O
be O
. O
I O
have O
been O
feeling O
this O
way O
since O
almost O
immediately O
after O
I O
took O
my O
first O
dose O
. O
Hearing O
that O
so O
many O
other O
people O
have O
experienced O
the O
same O
exact O
symptoms O
as O
me O
has O
given O
me O
the O
courage O
needed O
to O
STOP O
this O
medication O
. O
So O
many O
of O
my O
family O
members O
and O
friends O
have O
had O
bad O
reactions O
to O
this O
stuff- O
I O
can O
not O
trust O
it O
, O
and O
will O
be O
looking O
for O
another O
way O
to O
get O
my O
cholesterol O
under O
control O
, O
if O
possible O
. O
Be O
very O
careful O
and O
very O
informed O
before O
you O
start O
any O
new O
medication O
. O
Do O
n't O
always O
trust O
the O
word O
of O
your O
doctor O
as O
the O
only O
word O
and O
take O
it O
at O
its O
face O
value O
. O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
your O
body O
, O
you O
have O
every O
right O
to O
dictate O
, O
understand O
, O
and O
call O
the O
shots O
about O
what O
does O
and O
does O
not O
go O
in O
to O
it O

The O

that O
the O

that O

all O

I O
WILL O

TO O
SAY O

severe B-Disease
muscle I-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O
It O
has O
been O
about O
seven O
years O
since O
I O
've O
been O
off O
this O
but O
I O
still O
have O
muscle O
pains O
. O

I O
have O
been O
taking O
this O
medication O
for O
more O
than O
4 O
years O
for O
cholesterol O
. O
It O
has O
reduced O
the O
numbers O
, O
BUT O
I O
now O
have O
totally O
changed O
my O
way O
of O
life O
with O
general B-Disease
weakness I-Disease
, O
constant B-Disease
leg I-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
and O
specifically O
terrible B-Disease
pain I-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
feet I-Disease
and O
ankles O
. O
The O
bottoms B-Disease
of I-Disease
my I-Disease
feet I-Disease
hurt I-Disease
to O
the O
point O
of O
where O
I O
can O
no O
longer O
walk O
comfortably O
, O
and O
have O
experienced O
loss B-Disease
of I-Disease
balance I-Disease
several O
times O
a O
day O
. O
It O
is O
making O
me O
feel O
like O
75 O
instead O
of O
50 O
and O
I O
researched O
the O
web O
and O
came O
to O
this O
site O
. O
I O
have O
been O
telling O
my O
MD O
about O
symptoms O
for O
months O
. O
Blood O
tests O
keep O
coming O
back O
normal O
. O
Doc O
says O
must O
be O
circulation O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
'm O
wearing O
someone O
else O
's O
feet O
sometimes O
! O
Tingling B-Disease
toes I-Disease
to O
numb B-Disease
toes I-Disease
and O
sore B-Disease
ankles I-Disease
and O
legs O
. O
I O
finally O
get O
his O
attention O
and O
he O
tells O
me O
he O
's O
changing O
prescriptions O
to O
Mevacore B-Drug
( O
hello O
. O
it O
's O
the O
same O
thing O
) O
. O
After O
research O
I O
am O
quitting O
the O
medication O
and O
will O
give O
it O
a O
month O
to O
see O
what O
happens O
. O
Anyone O
put O
me O
onto O
some O
good O
information O
about O
withdrawals O
? O
Been O
reading O
some O
things O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
like O
. O

This O
drug O
enables O
me O
to O
be O
much O
more O
physically O
active O
with O
less O
dependence O
on O
pain B-Disease
relievers O
. O
I O
can O
bike O
at O
fairly O
high O
levels O
of O
intensity O
for O
as O
much O
as O
25 O
miles O
. O
I O
have O
n't O
tried O
longer O
but O
I O
'm O
sure O
I O
could O
and O
getting O
to O
that O
level O
was O
a O
great O
accomplishment O
. O
I O
have O
had O
6 O
knee O
surgeries O
including O
2 O
partial O
replacements O
. O
Use O
it O
before O
exercise O
. O
Reapply O
after O
shower O
and O
before O
bed O
. O
Highly O
recommended O
! O
It O
has O
not O
eliminated O
the O
need O
for O
oral O
pain O
meds O
in O
all O
situatations O
but O
has O
helped O
. O

Got O
shingles O
, O
and O
was O
told O
by O
a O
doctor O
the O
shingles B-Disease
resulted O
from O
the O
depletion O
of O
CoQ10 B-Drug
caused O
by O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
A O
research O
article O
in O
JAMA O
, O
2004 O
; O
291:2243-2252 O
concludes O
this O
: O
. O

Definitely O
short B-Disease
term I-Disease
memory I-Disease
issues I-Disease
, O
but O
I O
'm O
44 O
and O
I O
suppose O
it O
could O
be O
part O
of O
menopause B-Disease
on O
its O
way O
. O
lowered O
overall O
cholesterol O
and O
my O
hdl O
went O
up O
to O
59 O
from O
35 O
, O
and O
triglycerides O
went O
down O
but O
not O
enough O
. O
LDL O
down O
too O
but O
not O
enough O
so O
taking O
higher O
dose O
now O
. O
Worked O
like O
a O
champ O
at O
10 O
mg O
for O
first O
two O
years O
. O
Now O
switched O
from O
GP O
to O
cardiologist O
and O
he O
's O
upped O
it O
to O
40 O
mg O
so O
will O
see O
. O
have O
only O
taken O
3 O
tablets O
since O
new O
dosage O
. O

This O
drug O
makes O
me O
so O
agitated B-Disease
-- O
insomnia B-Disease
, O
hideously B-Disease
increased I-Disease
muscle I-Disease
tension I-Disease
, O
short B-Disease
tempered I-Disease
, O
impatient O
. O
It O
really O
helped O
with O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
hand I-Disease
& O
arm O
, O
but O
the O
agitation B-Disease
is O
unbearable O
. O
I O
got O
spasms B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
back I-Disease
from O
it O
and O
had O
to O
get O
therapy O
for O
those O
. O
I O
know O
it O
does O
n't O
make O
sense O
with O
the O
tiny O
dose O
I O
'm O
taking O
, O
& O
they O
say O
no O
systemic O
effects O
from O
the O
topical O
gel O
, O
but O
I O
've O
gone O
on O
& O
off O
it O
4 O
or O
5 O
times O
now O
and O
the O
effects O
when O
using O
it O
are O
unmistakeable O
. O

Was O
on O
LIPITOR O
for O
18 O
days O
. O
Developed B-Disease
sore I-Disease
legs I-Disease
, O
sore B-Disease
back I-Disease
, O
general O
tiredness B-Disease
and O
my B-Disease
head I-Disease
was I-Disease
foggy I-Disease
. O
making O
it O
difficult B-Disease
to I-Disease
concentrate I-Disease
. O
At O
day O
16 O
, O
developed O
excruciating O
toothache B-Disease
( O
that O
moved O
from O
day O
to O
day O
) O
. O
Gave O
up O
on O
day O
18 O
. O
At O
end O
of O
day O
19 O
, O
the O
toothache B-Disease
had O
gone O
. O
I O
would O
not O
recommend O
this O
drug O
to O
anyone O
. O
My O
father-in-law O
was O
on O
the O
same O
drug O
to O
defeat O
cholesterol O
and O
ended O
up O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
with O
symptoms B-Disease
of I-Disease
Parkison I-Disease
's I-Disease
disease I-Disease
. O
He O
died O
of O
a O
massive B-Disease
heart I-Disease
attack I-Disease
last O
year O
. O

Possibly O
diarrhea O
and O
stomach B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
but O
most O
likely O
none O
because O
I O
am O
taking O
this O
with O
a O
nasty O
antibiotic O
for O
a O
sinus B-Disease
infection I-Disease
that O
definitely O
causes O
diarrhea B-Disease
and O
nausea B-Disease
. O
I O
was O
supposed O
to O
take O
it O
2x/day O
for O
7 O
days O
and O
then O
2x/day O
as O
needed O
. O
I O
completed O
the O
7 O
days O
and O
then O
did O
not O
take O
it O
on O
the O
8th O
day O
. O
The O
pain B-Disease
was O
immediately O
worse O
than O
before O
taking O
Voltaren B-Drug
. O
It O
does O
help O
the O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
knee I-Disease
, O
which O
is O
a O
strained B-Disease
meniscus I-Disease
, O
but O
I O
'm O
afraid O
that O
the O
drug O
is O
masking O
the O
pain B-Disease
which O
enables O
me O
to O
overexert O
my O
joints O
and O
cause O
more O
injury O
. O
This O
really O
makes O
me O
nervous O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
speak O
with O
my O
doctor O
about O
this O
possibility O
. O

I O
am O
a O
61 O
year O
old O
male O
with O
a O
history O
of O
heart B-Disease
disease I-Disease
. O
I O
had O
a O
quadruple O
by-pass O
in O
1987 O
. O
I O
have O
not O
had O
any O
heart O
related O
issues O
since O
. O
My O
nurse O
practioner O
put O
me O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
about O
4 O
years O
ago O
. O
I O
have O
been O
experiencing O
pain O
in O
my O
right O

calf O
muscle O
for O
about O
3 O
years O

mentioned O
this O
on O
numerous O
office O
visits O
and O
was O
. O

Made O
a O
BIG O
improvement O
in O

, O
but O
in O
the O
three O
years O
I O

had O
extreme B-Disease
fatigue I-Disease
, O
muscle B-Disease

In O
recent O
months O
I O
've O
had O
chronic B-Disease
elbow I-Disease
pain I-Disease
in I-Disease
both I-Disease
arms I-Disease
. O
It O
just O
occurred O
to O
me O
that O
it O
might O
be O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
this O
site O
has O
convinced O
me O
. O
I O
just O
threw O
away O
a O
bottle O
with O
10 O
pills O
remaining O
and O
am O
going O
to O
continue O
with O
my O
diet O

Severe O
elbow O
, O

pain I-Disease

It O
's O
just O
a O
little O
white O
pill O
, O
this O
ca O
n't O
be O
causing O
all O
of O
my O
pain O
. O
Boy O
was O
I O
wrong O
, O
this O
pill O
has O
caused O
me O
so O
much O
grief O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
even O
watch O
TV O
with O
my O
family O
as O
the O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
arms I-Disease
and O
shoulder O
drove O
me O
to O
my O
bed O
. O
I O
felt O
so O
old O
and O
scared O
that O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
would O
be O
pain B-Disease
filled O
. O
One O
week O
ago O
I O
ran O
out O
of O
lipitor B-Drug
and O
after O
a O
few O
days O
found O
that O
my O
arm O
& O
elbow B-Disease
pain I-Disease
subsided O
. O
Why O
is O
n't O
this O
widely O
known O
? O
I O
'm O
angry O
and O
also O
sad O
, O
sad O
that O
I O
've O
wasted O
all O
this O
time O
and O
angry O
that O
the O
drug O
companies O
are O
getting O
richer O
by O

take O
Lipitor B-Drug
( O
10mg O
) O
. O
I O
have O
been O
taking O
it O
for O
about O
three O
months O
now O
. O
I O
will O
go O
for O
a O
blood O
test O
within O
a O
few O
days O
so O
we O
'll O
see O
how O
good O
it O
did O
its O
job O
. O
As O
far O
as O
side O
effects O
are O
concerned O
, O
I O
find O
that O
Lipitor B-Drug
also O
causes O
bloating B-Disease
and O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
gas B-Disease
build O
up O
although O
not O
as O
badly O
as O
my O
previous O
medication O
. O
I O
'm O
finding O
it O
difficult O
to O
fit O
into O
my O
clothes O
due O
to O
the O
bloating B-Disease
. O
I O
also O
find O
that O
it O
makes O
me O
a O
bit O
drowsy B-Disease
, O
almost O
like O
a O
sleeping O
pill O
. O
I O
therefore O
take O
it O
at O
bedtime O
but O
my O
sleep B-Disease
is I-Disease
not I-Disease
very I-Disease
sound I-Disease
and O
therefore O
not O
refreshing O
. O
I O
developed O
a O
pain O
that O
seems O
to O
originate O
at O
the O
base O
of O
my O
neck O
, O
travel O
down O
to O
my O
shoulder O
blades O
and O
then O
run O
to O
my O
shoulders O
, O
elbow O
and O
wrist O
. O
I O
first O
attributed O
this O
to O
work O
stress O
because O
I O
do O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
computer O
work O
. O
I O
thought O
perhaps O
that O
I O
was O
getting O
tendonitis B-Disease
looking O
at O
th O
. O
I O
have O
begun O
to O
take O
charge O
of O
fighting O
back O
against O
the O
side O
effects O
and O
have O
been O
taking O
multivitamins O
, O
B B-Drug
complex I-Drug
, O
CoQ10 B-Drug
, O
and O
GasX B-Drug
for O
bloating B-Disease
. O
I O
can O
honestly O
say O
that O
today O
is O
the O
first O
day O
in O

that O
I O
have O
felt O
really O

My O

But O
I O

fading O
away O

and O
it O
's O
a O

I O

just O
to O

. O
I O
've O
stopped O
taking O
it O

to O

what O
happens O

I O
was O
taking O

still O
on O

10mg O

each O
once O

after O
taking O
the O
cholesterol-lowering O
medicines O
( O
Mevacor B-Drug
and O
Lipitor B-Drug
) O
for O
approximately O
9 O
years O
. O
The O
Lipitor B-Drug
was O
great O
at O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
and O
improving O
the O
ratio O
of O
my O
HDL O
's O
to O
LDL O
's O
; O
however O
, O
on O
the O
advice O
of O
my O
doctor O
I O
have O
discontinued O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O
I O
did O
n't O
realize O
that O
I O
have O
n't O
been O
feeling O
well O
, O
until O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
now O
feel O
like O
my O
old O
self O
again O
. O
It O
's O
hard O
to O
explain O
, O
but O
I O
have O
a O
better O
sense O
of O
well-being O
and O
I O
've O
actually O
lost O
a O
few O
pounds O
even O
though O
I O
have O
not O
changed O
my O
diet O
. O
I O
feel O
less O
bloated B-Disease
, O
and O
my O
stomach O
feels O
more O
comfortable O
. O

No O
side O
effects O
so O
far O
, O
but O
have O
only O
been O
on O
it O
for O
a O
month O
. O
Has O
taken O
away O
20 O
% O
of O
my O
chronic B-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
trigger B-Disease
point I-Disease
pain I-Disease
on O
a O
good O
day O
and O
about O
5 O
to O
10 O
% O
on O
a O
bad O
day O
. O
No O
drowsiness B-Disease
, O
grogginess B-Disease
or O
memory B-Disease
loss I-Disease
like O
I O
had O
with O
Neurontin B-Drug
. O

It O
has O
taken O
its O
toll O
on O
my O
stomach O
in O
the O
past O
but O
it O
is O
the O
most O
effective O
med O
so O
far O
. O
Must O
take O
it O
with O
a O
full O
meal O
. O
I O
really O
made O
a O
difference O
, O
improvement O
of O
quality O
of O
life O
. O

51 O
yr O
old O
female O
. O
After O
2 O
1/2 O
years O
on O
it O
( O
10 O
mg/day O
) O
I O
developed O
serious O
muscle B-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
restlessness O
in O
my O
legs O
which O
made O
it O
almost O
impossible O
to O
sleep O
. O
Also O
, O
hot/cold B-Disease
fever-like I-Disease
sensations I-Disease
in I-Disease
the I-Disease
skin I-Disease
, O
but O
no O
fever B-Disease
. O
Constant B-Disease
sleepiness I-Disease
. O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
developed O
chronic B-Disease
fatigue I-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
and O
restless B-Disease
leg I-Disease
syndrome I-Disease
until O
I O
looked O
on O
the O
internet O
for O
Lipitor B-Drug
side O
effects O
. O
I O
am O
just O
glad O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
before O
permanent O
damage O
was O
done O
. O
Yes O
, O
it O
did O
a O
great O
job O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
but O
the O
side O
effects O
are O
very O
dangerous O
and O
I O
would O
think O
long O
and O
hard O
before O
taking O
any O
statin O
. O
I O
would O
guess O
that O
many O
of O
our O
elderly O
relatives O
who O
seem O
to O
have O
cognitive B-Disease
impairments I-Disease
are O
really O
suffering O
from O
statin O
side O
effects O
. O
The O
drug O
companies O
have O
certainly O
done O
a O
number O
on O
the O
American O
public O
. O

I O
Have O
been O
on O
lipitor B-Drug
for O
several O
years O
. O
I O
have O
noticed O
over O
the O
last O
few O
years O
that O
I O
have O
not O
been O

. O
The O
last O
couple O

they O
all O

I O
decided O
to O

I O

I O
have O
been O
on O
it O
. O
I O
'm O
hoping O
that O
this O
dizziness B-Disease
will O
go O
away O
in O
time O
now O
that O
I O
have O
stopped O
lipitor B-Drug
. O
None O
of O
my O
doctors O
will O
admit O
that O
is O
lipitor B-Drug

I O
started O
experiencing O
severe O
leg B-Disease
cramping I-Disease
at O
night O
with O
the O
pain B-Disease
traveling I-Disease
to I-Disease
my I-Disease
buddocks I-Disease
and O
stomach O
as O
well O
. O
The O
pain B-Disease
was O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
had O
to O
crawl O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bathroom O
to O
take O
Advil B-Drug
. O
I O
asked O
my O
doctor O
what O
could O
have O
caused O
this O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
from O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
Recently O
I O
experienced O
extreme O
stomach B-Disease
pain I-Disease
that O
stretched O
to O
my O
side O
and O
back O
. O
The O
stomach B-Disease
pain I-Disease
came O
suddenly O
and O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
for O
a O
week O
before O
it O
became O
so O
bad O
I O
could B-Disease
not I-Disease
sleep I-Disease
. O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
urinery B-Disease
tract I-Disease
infection I-Disease
( O
one O
of O
the O
side-effects O
) O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
had O
returned O
but O
the O
symptoms O
were O
different O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
urge B-Disease
to I-Disease
urinate I-Disease
constantly O
but O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
and O
I O
would O
have O
no O
symptoms O
for O
a O
day O
then O
it O
would O
return O
again O
. O
I O
remembered O
reading O
the O
phamplet O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
it O
mentioning O
some O
of O
symptoms O
that O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
a O
day O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
more O
stomach B-Disease
pain I-Disease
or O
urgency B-Disease
. O
I O
also O
had O
been O
experiencing O
lack B-Disease
of I-Disease
energy I-Disease
for O
quite O
some O
time O
and O
I O
attributed O
this O
to O
stress B-Disease
but O
after O
reading O
this O
website O
I O
feel O
it O
was O
due O
to O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
also O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
I O
will O
take O
this O
drug O
anymore O
and O
since O
I O
read O
that O
taking O
vitamin B-Drug
C I-Drug
can O
help O
you O
with O
your O
cholesterol O
I O
think O
I O
will O
try O
this O
method O
instead O
. O
I O
think O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
to O
lowering O
cholesterol O
than O
such O
a O
potent O
drug O
that O
can O
cause O
so O
many O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
be O
a O
case-study O
when O
they O
finally O
take O
this O
drug O
off O
the O
market O
. O

After O
almost O
1 O
year O
on O
10 O
mg/day O
, O
woke O
up O
one O
morning O
with O
right O
foot B-Disease
turned I-Disease

right I-Disease
angle I-Disease

Unable O
to O
straighten O
it O

doctors O
unable O
to O
find O
a O
reason O
for O
it O

Walked O
like O
that O
for O
about O
six O
months O
with O
increasing O
pain O
, O
especially O
in O
right O
thigh O
which O
felt O
. O
I O
'm O
so O
disillusioned O
with O
the O
drug O
companies O
and O
the O
FDA O
that O
I O
wo O
n't O
take O
anything O
my O
doctor O
recommends O
again O
. O
Lipitor B-Drug
has O
robbed O
me O
and O
my O
family O
of O
my O
former O
active O
self O
and O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
whether O
I O
will O
ever O
return O
to O
normal O
. O
Will O
try O
the O
CoQ10 B-Drug
idea O
and O
also O
physical O
therapy O
to O
try O
to O
realign O
everything O
from O
my O
hips O
down O
so O
I O
can O
move O
normally O
again O
. O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
THIS O
DRUG O
! O
IT O
IS O
NOT O
WORTH O
TRADING O
YOUR O
QUALITY O
OF O
LIFE O
FOR O
A O
LOWER O
CHOLESTEROL O
NUMBER O
! O
! O
! O
I O
too O
would O
like O
to O
join O
a O
class O
action O
suit O

as O
I O
feel O
Pfizer O
was O
well O
aware O
of O
the O
damage O
this O
drug O
could O
do O
. O

I O
am O
experiencing O
severe O
hip O

which O
is O
drastically O
impairing O
the O
ability O
to O
walk O
anything O
beyond O
a O
relatively O
short O
distance O
. O
The O
question O
is O
. O
is O
lipitor B-Drug
causing O
this O
? O
I O
am O
taking O
20 O
mg O
a O
day O
and O
have O
been O
taking O
this O
for O
6 O
years O
. O
This O
has O
been O
a O
huge O
problem O
for O
the O
last O
2.5 O
years O
. O
I O
read O
this O
website O
and O
feel O
that O
lipitor B-Drug
is O
causing O
my O
pain B-Disease
. O
I O
have O
been O
to O
numberous O
orthopods O
, O
rheumetoligists O
, O
neouroligist O
, O
and O
others O
who O
can O
not O
find O
any O
problems O
. O
So O
, O
when O
I O
read O
about O
all O
these O
people O
who O
seem O
to O
have O
figured O
this O
out O
. O
I O
have O
hope O
. O
But O
are O
they O
correct O
in O
thier O
assumptions O
? O
We O
are O
all O
desperate O
to O
find O
an O
answer O
( O
the O
cause O
) O
and O
ultimately O
a O
cure O
. O
But O
is O
lipitor B-Drug
the O
answer O
? O
That O
is O

None O
, O
unless O
too O
much O
is O
taken O
too O
close O
together O
, O
then O
it O
can O
cause O
gassy B-Disease
abdominal I-Disease

It O
is O
the O
BEST O
pain B-Disease
reliever O
I O
have O

I O
will O
never O
do O
without O
it O

has O
attached O

`` O
everything O

Sciatic B-Disease

I O
do O
Restorative O
Yoga O

to O
get O
myself O
loosened O
up O
every O
day O
, O
but O
keep O
the O
Cataflam B-Drug
handy O
as O
nothing O
works O
better O
for O
the O
pain B-Disease
, O
unless O
I O
have O
an O
extremely O
bad O
time O
where O
I O
have O
to O
take O
a O
Demerol B-Drug
with O
it O
( O
rarely O
) O

However O
, O
I O
have O
noticed O
in O
the O
`` O
patient O

they O
give O
with O
my O

that O
now O
warnings O
of O
NSAID O

strokes B-Disease
are O
written O
where O
they O
were O

I O
started O
this O
Rx O

The O
best O
dose O
for O
me O
( O
per O
my O
doctor O
) O
is O
2 O
pills O
to O
get O
in O
your O

then O
1 O

from O
a O
percentage O
perspective O
anyway O
) O
. O
It O
's O
always O
been O
right O
around O
120/120 O
. O
For O
what O
ever O
reason O
my O
LDL O
shot O
up O
to O
175 O
so O
a O
( O
not O
my O
normal O
one O
) O
Dr O
just O
prescribed O
me O
Lipitor B-Drug
. O
I O
did O
n't O
notice O
any O
problems O
for O
just O
over O
2 O
months O
then O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
one O
day O
I O
stared O
feeling B-Disease
horrible I-Disease
like I-Disease
a I-Disease
severe I-Disease

just I-Disease
hit I-Disease

she O
also O
drew O
blood O

Luckily O
most O
of O
the O

a O
small O

great O
as O
well O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
the O

does O

to O
how O

to O
listen O
to O
you O
regarding O

. O
Called O
Pfizer O

talked O
with O

recommended O
I O
let O
my O
doctor O
know O
about O
symptoms O
. O
She O
explained O
that O
drug O
was O
mfg O
in O
USA O
. O
My O
concern O
was O
that O
maybe O
some O
of O
the O
drug O
was O
mfg O
outside O
of O
USA O
, O
like O
maybe O
China O
and O
that O
a O
portion O
of O
the O
formula O
was O
causing O
problems O
. O
But O
in O
general O
the O
whole O
formula O
is O
poison O
so O
far O
as O
I O
am O
concerned O
. O
Thank O
God O
for O
this O
website O
. O
Am O
seeing O
new O

and O
if O
he O
does O

take O
me O

am O
going O
to O
do O
it O
myself O

Will O
take O
my O
chances O
rather O
than O
live O

For O

the O

me O
on O
40 O
mg/day O
after O
years O
of O
unsatisfactory O
results O
with O

I O
can B-Disease

-took O
for O
only O
10 O
days O
. O
Have O
been O
off O
for O
4 O
days O
with O
no O
improvement-I O
am O
terrified O
. O
Went O
to O
the O
doctor O
and O
he O
did O
no O
additional O
tests O
- O
just O
said O
to O
stay O
off O
lipitor B-Drug
. O
When O
I O
asked O
if O
I O
would O
feel O
better-he O
just O
said O
he O
hoped O
so-what O
is O
that O
supposed O
to O
mean O
? O
? O
Has O
anyone O
had O
any O
advice O
from O
their O
doctor O
on O
how O
to O
reverse O
these O
effects O
? O
. O
I O
WOULD O
NOT O
TAKE O
THIS O
MEDICINE-WOULD O

Muscle B-Disease

and O
extreme B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
nausea B-Disease
, O

, O
dark O
urine O
, O

. O
I O
have O
been O
off O
of O
it O
for O
4 O
days O
and O
can B-Disease
barely I-Disease
walk I-Disease
. O
I O
hope O
that O
this O
is O
not O
permanent O
. O
I O
thought O
that O
I O
had O
the O
flu B-Disease
bug I-Disease
tht O
was O
going O
around O
the O
neighborhood O
. O
I O
had O
taken O
pravochol B-Drug
for O
years O
with O
not O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
was O
n't O
lowering O
my O
cholesterol O
enough O
. O

I O
was O
prescribed O
this O
drug O
because O
I O
had O
spent O
a O
whole O
night O
in O
complete O
agony B-Disease
; O
abdominal B-Disease
pain I-Disease
, O
lower O
back O
pain O
, O
all O
that O
I O
imagine O
labor B-Disease
pain I-Disease
to O
be O
, O
except O
I O
was O
not O
in O
labor O
. O
Though O
the O
cause O
of O
my O
pain B-Disease
remains O
undetermined O
, O
the O
Arthrotec B-Drug
combined O
with O
Paracetamol B-Drug
pretty O
much O
eliminated O
the O
pain B-Disease
. O
This O
was O
a O
big O
relief O
, O
as O
the O
1200 O
MG O
of O
Ibuprofen B-Drug
I O
had O
taken O
throughout O
the O
night O
had O
done O
nothing O
. O
I O
only O
took O
1 O
Arthrotec B-Drug
and O
1 O
Paracetamol B-Drug
and O
that O
did O
the O
trick O
. O
HOWEVER O
: O
I O
had O
a O
very O
bad O
headache B-Disease
yesterday O
and O
Ibuprofen B-Drug
again O
did O
n't O
work O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
other O
Arthrotec B-Drug
pills O
left O
, O
so O
I O
took O
one O
. O
Although O
it O
alleviated O
the O
pain B-Disease
, O
I O
got O
up O
this O
morning O
with O
heavy B-Disease
vaginal I-Disease
bleeding I-Disease
even O
though O
my O
period O
ended O
last O
week O
. O
I O
was O
relieved O
to O
read O
that O
this O
could O
be O
a O
side O
effect O
, O
as O
it O
means O
I O
probably O
do O
n't O
have O
something O
serious O
, O
but O
I O
will O
have O
to O
be O
in O
some O
serious B-Disease
pain I-Disease
to O
risk O
bleeding B-Disease
from I-Disease
the I-Disease
vagina I-Disease
again O
. O
Next O
time O
I O
'll O
try O
my O
luck O
with O
Paracetamol B-Drug
. O
The O
pill O
I O
took O
consisted O
of O
50 O
MG O
Diclofenac O
and O

Depression B-Disease
came O
with O
a O
vengence B-Disease
. O
I O
have O
never O
gone O
for O
therapy O
, O
but O
had O
no O
choice O
. O
they O
suggested O
a O
connection O
with O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
so O
I O
went O
searching O
- O
wow O
what O
an O
eye O
opening O
- O
I O
am O
not O
the O
only O
one O
. O
As O
of O
now O
, O
never O
again O
will O
I O
take O
lipitor B-Drug
. O

After O
using O
Lipitor B-Drug
for O
2.5 O
years O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
stop O
two O
weeks O
ago O
because O
of O
severe O
pain O
in O
my O
left O
arm O
. O
I O
am O
left O
handed O
and O
recently O
could O
n't O
normally O
do O
my O
job O
. O
Twice O
I O
told O
my O
doctor O
about O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
arm I-Disease
and O
he O
did O
n't O
take O
that O
seriously O
, O
ignoring O
my O
complaint O
. O
After O
two O
weeks O
of O
not O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
my O
arm O
almost O
recovered O
and O
I O
can O
work O
without O
any O
pain B-Disease
or O
any O
problem O
. O
It O
started O
a O
long O
time O
ago O
with O
tingling B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
arms I-Disease
, O
they O
were O
often O
fall O

, O
usually O
when O
I O
wake O
up O
in O
the O

From O
month O

pain B-Disease
was O
worst O
until O
I O
almost O
lost B-Disease
all I-Disease
strength I-Disease
and O
could B-Disease
n't I-Disease
use I-Disease
my I-Disease
arm I-Disease
. O
Anyway O
, O
I O
think O
I O
made O
a O
good O
decision O
by O
not O
using O
Lipitor B-Drug
anymore O
( O
my O
doctor O
will O
be O
mad O
at O
me O
) O
. O

natural O
supplements O
and O
more O
exercising O
. O
I O
am O
very O
`` O
anxious O

that O
can O
cause O

I O
wish O

more O
open O
to O
the O
idea O
that O
it O
was O
causing O
me O
problems O

The O
only O
side O
effect O
they O
asked O
about O
was O
muscle B-Disease

which O
I O
did O

have O
, O
and O
I O
was O
basically O
told O
Lipitor B-Drug

cause O
anything O
else O

did O
you O
know O
that O
these O
. O
ALL O
side O

This O
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
drugs O
I O
have O
ever O
taken O
. O
I O
have O
now O
been O
off O
of O
this O
drug O
for O
over O
5 O
months O
and O
have O
still O
not O
fully O
recovered O
. O

after O
visiting O
this O
site O
it O
is O
like O
looking O
into O
a O
mirrow O
. O
i O
have O
had O
most O
of O
the O
problems O
many O
are O
having O
, O
infact O
it O
is O
4 O
am O
can O
not O
sleep O
for O
just O
turning B-Disease
in I-Disease
bed I-Disease
is I-Disease
painful I-Disease
. O
decided O
to O
do O
a O
little O
research O
on O
LIPITOR B-Drug
it O
has O
dropped O
cholosterol O
from O
395 O
to O
187 O
and O
tri O
from O
1100 O
to O
300 O
but O
i O
wounder O
if O
it O
worth O
the O
side-effects O
. O
before O
medication O
had O
mild B-Disease
heart I-Disease
attack I-Disease
was O
put O
on O
lipitor B-Drug
, O
at O
first O
i O
felt O
good O
but O
now O
back B-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
tiredness B-Disease
is I-Disease
at I-Disease
a I-Disease
high I-Disease
level I-Disease
, O
my O
wife O
complains O
that O
i O
need O
exercise O
but O
she O
does O
not O
understand O
i O
hurt O
just O
as O
much O
now O
as O
i O
did O
with O
the O
heart B-Disease
attack I-Disease
, O
i O
guess O
it O
all O
boils O
down O
to O
if O
i O
could O
get O
some O
rest O
, O
but O
seems O
impossible O
for O
just O
moving B-Disease
in I-Disease
bed I-Disease
is I-Disease
painful I-Disease
. O

Heartburn B-Disease
and O
stomach B-Disease
upset I-Disease
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
pretty O
well O
. O
I O
still O
have O
pain B-Disease
but O
less O
severe O
. O
I O
have O
been O
somewhat O
concerned O
about O
taking O
this O
drug O
for O
so O
long O
due O
to O
the O
possible O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
my O
Dr O
checks O
me O
out O
( O
blood O
work O
, O
etc O
) O
every O
four O
months O
and O
I O
seem O
to O
be O
doing O
allright O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
get O
started O
on O

There O
must O
be O
something O
better O
than O
this O
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
POLICOSANOL B-Drug
. O

Once O
I O
had O
bad O
nausea B-Disease
due O
to O
taking O
it O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
. O
Also O
causes O

problems I-Disease
. O
Stops O

immediately O
when O
taken O
early O
on O
when O
all O
others O
did O
n't O
. O
If O
I O
wait O
I O
have O
to O
take O
two O
doses O
. O
Easy O
to O
take O
- O
a O
powder O
in O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
water O
. O
It O
is O
an O
anti-inflammatory O
, O
not O
a O
hypnotic O
. O
My O
insurance O
only O
pays O
for O
4 O
doses O
a O
month O
, O
less O
than O
I O
need O
, O
and O
paying O
for O
it O
without O
insurance O
is O
too O
expensive O
. O

I O
called O
in O
a O
refill O
for O
Lexapro B-Drug
and O
they O
refilled O
it O
with O
LIPITOR B-Drug
by O
mistake O
. O
I O
went O
through O
nearly O
that O
whole O
bottle O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
before O
realizing O
the O
mistake O
. O
The O
side O
effects O
of O
this O

. O
EXTREME B-Disease

that O
I O
unknowingly O
ramped O
up O
on O

had O
to O
suffer O
those O
side O
effects O
but O
I O
was O
also O
as O
a O
result O

so O
I O
had O
to O

Went O
to O
the O

after O
the O
first O
two O
weeks O

cause O

did O
n't O
know O
about O
the O

It O
was O
so O

I O
had O
to O
go O

had O
spent O
the O
day O
there O
already O
for O

was O
given O
a O
prescription O

but O
after O
reading O
all O

I O
doubt O
it O
very O
much O

Will O
never O
take O

it O
just O

a O
little O
drowsy B-Disease
! O
. O

Extreme B-Disease
fatigue I-Disease
and O
general B-Disease
weak I-Disease
feeling I-Disease
overall I-Disease
like O
I O

all O
honestly O
, O
I O
feel O

taken I-Disease
a I-Disease
sudden I-Disease
decline I-Disease
after O

only O
two O
weeks O

I O
intend O
to O
phone O
my O
M.D O

morning O
about O

Severe O
back O

This O
was O
the O
worst O
drugs O
I O
could O

taken O
and O
could O
not O
possibly O
recommend O
that O
anyone O

Lipitor B-Drug
caused O
permanent O
liver O

kidney B-Disease
damage I-Disease

is O
a O
killer O
. O

Side O
effects O
are O
some O
drowsiness B-Disease
and O
some O
dry B-Disease
mouth I-Disease
. O
Can O
take O
it O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
The O
drowsiness B-Disease
is O
nice O
and O
helps O
me O
sleep O
, O
as O
well O
. O
Overall O
an O
excellent O
drug O
that O
works O
better O
than O
any O
other O
NSAID O
I O
've O
tried O
! O
. O
I O
was O
surprised O
to O
find O
that O
this O
drug O
noticeably O
lowers O
my O
pain B-Disease
level O
after O
about O
45 O
minutes O
. O
I O
still O
have O
to O
take O
it O
in O
combo O
with O
a O
stronger O
pain B-Disease
reliever O
, O
but O
it O
's O
just O
a O
good O
drug O
for O
aches B-Disease
and O
pains B-Disease
. O
Better O
than O
things O
like O
Vioxx B-Drug
and O
OTC O
stuff O
, O
for O
sure O
. O

I O
have O
been O
on O
Arthrotec B-Drug
for O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
and O
have O
been O
very O
pleased O
that O
it O
does O
help O
deal O
with O
my O
back B-Disease
pain I-Disease
. O
However O
. O
over O
the O
last O
six O
months O
, O
I O
have O
started O
having O
vaginal B-Disease
bleeding I-Disease
almost O
every O
day O
of O
the O
month O
. O
Lots O
of O
clotting B-Disease
, I-Disease
and I-Disease
horrible I-Disease
periods I-Disease
. O
I O
went O
to O
the O
obgyn O
and O
everything O
came O
out O
normal O
. O
The O
doc O
put O
me O
on O
birth B-Drug
control I-Drug
. O
But O
, O
the O
bleeding B-Disease
has I-Disease
not I-Disease
subsided I-Disease
. O
So O
now O
I O
am O
scheduled O
to O
have O
an O
endometrial O
biopsy O
on O
Wed O
. O
I O
had O
an O
ephiphany O
last O
night O
about O
Arthrotec B-Drug
and O
began O
researching O
the O
side O
effect O
. O
When O
I O
came O
across O
this O
website O
, O
I O
was O
appalled O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
the O
females O
mention O
heavy/extra B-Disease
vaginal I-Disease
bleeding I-Disease
. O
I O
firmly O
believe O
this O
is O
the O
answer O
to O
my O
bleeding B-Disease
problem I-Disease
and O
will O
be O
telling O
the O
doctor O
on O
Monday O
, O
. O
Although O
this O
drug O
has O
helped O
with O
the O
pain B-Disease
, O
it O
is O
not O
worth O
the O
cost O
and O
hassle O
of O
bleeding B-Disease
constantly I-Disease
. O
, O
On O
top O
of O
that O
, O
I O
am O
now O
having O
to O
have O
a O
procedure O
that O
a O
31 O
year O
old O
should O
not O
have O
to O
endure O
. O
I O
truly O
hope O
that O
there O
are O
no O
long O
term O
effects O
from O
this O
. O
I O
have O
not O
taken O
Arthrotec B-Drug
in O
almost O
a O
week O
, O
yet O
I O
am O
still O
bleeding B-Disease
. O
I O
do O
not O
look O
forward O
to O
the O
extra B-Disease
pains I-Disease
I O
will O
llkely O
experience O
in O
a O
couple O
weeks O
, O
but O
I O
am O
sure O
I O
can O
find O
something O
else O
to O
deal O
with O
them O
. O
I O
feel O
that O
I O
have O
become O
dependent O
on O
this O
medicine O
to O
function O

went O
from O
very O
active O
to O

I O
have O
tried O
all O

you O
know O
the O
very O
expensive O
drug O
of O
choice O
for O
all O
the O
doc O
's O
out O

. O
For O
all O
of O
you O
who O
now O
have O
extremely O
low O
LDL O
and O
a O
bad O
case O
of O
joint O
pain O
to O
the O
extent O
that O
it O
is O
very O
arthritic O

having O
bad O
Muscle B-Disease

that O
you O
never O
got O
prior O
to O
the O
drug O
, O
it O
is O
from O
the O
statins O
. O
The O
drug O
is O
able O
to O
decrease O
LDL O
through O
a O
mechanism O
which O
also O
destroys O
and O
depletes O
your O
bodies O
ability O
to O
make O
CoQ10 O
. O
This O
is O
necessary O
for O
they O
health O
of O
muscles O
and O
joints O
( O
that O
's O
why O
you O
are O
experiencing O
the O
Joint B-Disease
pains I-Disease

Numbness B-Disease
) O
. O
Remember O
your O
heart O
is O
a O
muscle O
, O
guess O
what O
is O
happening O
to O
it O
with O
the O
depletion O
of O
the O
CoQ10 O
? O
? O
? O
If O
you O
do O
some O
research O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
all O
these O
statins O
make O
no O
claims/nor O
have O
studies O
shown O
them O
to O
reduce O
Heart B-Disease
attacks I-Disease
, O
but O
they O
cause O
Muscle B-Disease
problems I-Disease
i.e O
. O
your O
heart O
, O
this O
is O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
put O
younger O
and O
younger O
people O
on O
these O
drugs O
and O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
that O
you O
do O
your O
own O
research O
versus O
just O
listening O
to O
the O
doctor O
who O
wants O
your O
LDL O
down O
to O
like O
below O
130 O
, O
neurosurgeons O
, O
who O
have O
studied O
this O
would O
tell O
you O
not O
to O
get O
it O
all O
too O
low O
. O
And O
just O
because O
your O
test O
come O
back O
and O
show O
your O
liver O
functions O
are O
fine O
and O
do O
n't O
show O
any O
broken O
down O
muscle O
toxins O
in O
the O
blood O
does O
n't O
mean O
the O
lack O
of O
CoQ10 O
is O
n't O
breaking O
down O
and O
Your B-Disease
muscles I-Disease
could I-Disease
be I-Disease
damaged. I-Disease
very O
slowly O

Mine O
always O

I O

never O

( O

, O
High B-Disease

and O
maybe O

you O

something O

the O

you O
do O

for O
a O

and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
mor O
. O
I O
think O
there O
should O
be O
a O
better O
alternative O
to O
lowering O
cholesterol O
than O
such O
a O
potent O
drug O
that O
can O
cause O

many O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
do O
n't O
want O
to O

a O
case-study O
when O

finally O
take O
this O
drug O
off O
the O
market O
. O

After O
about O
4 O
years O
of O
taking O
I O
started O
experiencing O
at O
night O
with O
the O
pain O
traveling O
to O
my O
buddocks O
and O
stomach O
as O
well O
. O
The O
was O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O
of O
the O
bed O
and O
had O
to O
crawl O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bathroom O
to O
take O
for O
the O
. O
I O
asked O
my O
doctor O
what O
could O
have O
caused O
this O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
from O
the O
. O
Recently O
I O
experienced O
extreme O
that O
stretched O
to O
my O
side O
and O
back O
. O
The O
came O
suddenly O
and O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
for O
a O
week O
before O
it O
became O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
sleep O
. O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
had O
returned O
but O
the O
symptoms O
were O
different O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
but O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
and O
I O
would O
have O
no O
symptoms O
for O
a O
day O
then O
it O
would O
return O
again O
. O
I O
remembered O
reading O
the O
phamplet O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
it O
mentioning O
some O
of O
symptoms O
that O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
for O
a O
day O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
mor O

not O
all O

, O
seemed O
to O
be O
the O

of O
the O
evils O
with O

However O
, O
due O

, O
cardiologist O
gradually O
increased O
the O

been O
gradual O
over O
the O

recent O
diagnosed O

after O

out O

After O
reading O
your O
comments O

I O
have O
decided O
to O
reduce O
the O
dosage O
from O
40mg O
to O
20mg O
for O
a O
week O
to O
see O
if O
this O
relieves O
the O
most O
recent O
symptoms O
. O
If O
improvement O
is O
noted O
, O
then O
I O
will O
contact O
my O
doctor O
for O
a O
further O
reduction O
in O
the O
dosage O
to O
determine O
if O
other O
symptoms O
abate O
. O
I O
appreciate O

keep O

The O
week O
I O
started O
to O
take O
I O
had O
the O
, O
confirmed O
to O
be O
muscular O
by O
doctors O
. O
At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
second O
week O
, O
I O
accidentally O
took O
a O
dose O
in O
the O
morning O
instead O
of O
the O
night O
because O
I O
took O
the O
wrong O
pill O
( O
skipped O
the O
night O
dose O
) O
. O
The O
day O
after O
I O
started O
to O
have O
the O
other O
symptons O
. O
The O
worst O
one O
- O
the O
mouth O
one O
has O
faded O
, O
but O
the O
others O
remain O
. O
I O
found O
out O
too O
late O
grapefruit O
juice O
can O
make O
this O
drug O
stronger O
. O
I O
drank O
it O
some O
days O
during O
the O
first O
2 O
weeks O
. O
Stopped O
drinking O
it O
. O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
third O
week O
I O
took O
50mg O
of O
per O
day O
for O
3 O
days O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
sense O
an O
improvement O
, O
but O
after O
stopping O
for O
other O
three O
days O
I O
will O
try O
again O
. O
( O
I O
need O
better O
evidence O
before O
buying O
a O
can O
of O
, O
it O
is O
very O
expensive O
and O
hard O
to O
find O
around O
here O
) O
. O
Will O
beg O
my O
cardiologist O
to O
let O
me O
try O
natural O
exercise O
before O
continuing O
statins O
. O
Giving O
it O
a O
3 O
, O
because O
it O
was O
effective O
, O
in O
a O
single O
month O
and O
with O
and O
exercise O
all O
my O
numbers O
are O
in O
very O
safe O
ranges O
. O
Please O
be O
careful O
about O
natural O
supplements O
. O
Homeopathy O
simply O
does O
not O
work O
- O
it O
is O
just O
water O
- O
The O
supplements O
that O
do O
work O
may O
also O
have O
side O

, O
just O
like O
the O

Red O
Yeast O
Rice O
, O
for O
example O
, O
actually O
contains O
a O
statin O
( O

, O
so O
it O
will O
most O
likely O
have O
all O
the O
set O
of O
side O
effects O
as O
the O

about O
2 O

went O

all O

wanted O

when O
I O
quit O

I O
got O

get O
him O
to O
believe O

Lipitor B-Drug

was O
causing O
this O

put O

hide O
the O

! O

! O
! O
. O
I O
was O
put O
on O
this O
drug O
by O
my O
doctor O
for O
my O
somewhat O
High B-Disease
cholesterol I-Disease
- I-Disease
. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
after O
starting O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
suddenly O
I B-Disease
felt I-Disease
that I-Disease
i I-Disease
had I-Disease
aged I-Disease
overnight I-Disease
to I-Disease
about I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old. I-Disease
but O
did O
not O
connect O
it O
to O
starting O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
I B-Disease
have I-Disease
felt I-Disease
all I-Disease
that I-Disease
your I-Disease
age I-Disease
caught I-Disease
up I-Disease
with I-Disease
you. I-Disease
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O

but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O
pill O
can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O
recovering O
like O
I O
did O
the O
first O
time O
. O
This O
has O
ruined O
my O
life O
and O
I O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
if O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
know O
now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O
permanent O
damage O
. O
My O
doctor O
, O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
this O
, O
wanted O
to O
change O
statins O
because O
he O
was O
still O
worried O
about O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
I O
told O
him O
no O
more O
statins O
and O
he O
then O
prescribed O
, O
which O
he O
said O
was O
was O
less O
effective O
but O
was O
not O
a O
statin O
, O
which O
I O
am O
still O
afraid O
to O
take O
unless O
I O
improve O
from O
the O
affects O
of O
the O
. O
He O
told O
me O
he O
was O
on O
himself O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problems O
but O
then O
said O
, O
well O
he O
did O
have O
that O
could O
have O
been O
a O
side O
affect O
, O
but O
that O
he O
had O
been O
on O
the O
drug O
two O
years O
before O
this O
developed O
. O
I O
told O
him O
of O
the O
information O
on O
this O
site O
that O
describes O
some O
people O
having O
that O
delayed O
reaction O
and O
I O
advised O
him O
to O
take O
himself O
off O
of O
this O
drug O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
the O
neck O
pains O
cleared O
up O
! O
I O
advise O
, O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
THIS O
DRUG O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
. O

My B-Disease
body I-Disease
has I-Disease
a I-Disease
serious I-Disease
fatigue. I-Disease
AND O
AND O
THAT O
CONTINUE O
TO O
THIS O
DAY O
AFTER O
BEING O
OFF O
THE O
DRUG O
FOR O
ALMOST O
A O
YEAR O
. O
DO O
NOT O
TAKE O
THIS O
DRUG O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
. O
I O
was O
put O
on O
this O
drug O
by O
my O
doctor O
for O
my O
somewhat O
. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
after O
starting O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
suddenly O
but O
did O
not O
connect O
it O
to O
starting O
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O

and O

I O

I O
found O
it O
caused O
Extreme B-Disease
bloating I-Disease

It O
also O
seem O
to O
increase O
my O
heart O

therefore O
Could B-Disease
not I-Disease

. O
I O
requested O
to O
take O
Lipitor B-Drug

( O
10mg O

. O
I O
have O
been O
taking O
it O
for O
about O
three O

I O
will O
go O
for O
a O
blood O

a O
few O

we O

how O
good O
it O
did O
its O
job O
. O
As O
far O
as O
side O
effects O
are O
concerned O
, O
I O
find O
that O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
also O
causes O
Bloating B-Disease
and O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
Gazette B-Disease
build O
up O
although O
not O
as O
badly O
as O
my O
previous O
medication O
. O
I O
'm O
finding O
it O
difficult O
to O
fit O
into O
my O
clothes O
due O
to O
the O
Bloating B-Disease
. O
I O
also O
find O

it O
makes O
me O
a O
bit O
Drowsy. B-Disease
, O
almost O
like O
a O
sleeping O
pill O

I O
therefore O
take O
it O
at O
bedtime O
but O
my O
The B-Disease
sleep I-Disease
is I-Disease
not I-Disease
very I-Disease
sound. I-Disease
and O
therefore O
not O
refreshing O
. O
I O
developed O
a O
pain O
that O
seems O
to O
originate O
at O
the O
base O
of O
my O
neck O
, O
travel O
down O

my O

run O

my O

I O

I O
called O
in O
a O
refill O
for O
Lexapro. B-Drug
and O
they O
refilled O
it O
with O
Lipitor B-Drug

by O
mistake O

I O
went O
through O
nearly O
that O
whole O
bottle O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
before O
realizing O
the O
mistake O
. O
The O
side O
effects O
of O
this O
drug O
was O
that O
my O
The B-Disease
muscles I-Disease
ached. I-Disease
so O
bad O
and O
my O
Joints B-Disease
hurt. I-Disease
and O
I O
felt O

an O
85 O
yr O

instead O
of O
a O
42 O
yr O
old O
. O
Extreme B-Disease
exhaustion I-Disease

It O
was O
bad O
enough O
that O
I O
unknowingly O
ramped O
up O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
and O
had O
to O
suffer O
those O
side O
effects O
but O
I O
was O
also O
as O
a O
result O
cold O
turkey O
on O
my O
anti-depressant O
so O
I O
had O
to O
endure O
its O
nasty O
cold O
turkey O
withdrawal O
symptoms O
. O
I O
know O
that O
for O
two O
weeks O
I O
could O
only O
work O
a O
half O
day O
before O
I O
HAD O
to O
go O
home O

PASS O
OUT O
. O
Then O
I O
took O
another O
week O
for O
vacation O
. O
Went O
to O
the O
doc O
after O
the O
first O
two O
weeks O
of O
the O
torment O

EVERYTHING O
checked O
good O
cause O
we O
did O
n't O
know O
about O
the O
Lexapro. B-Drug
/ O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
swap O
. O
I O
felt O

a O

I O
knew O
the O
Bone B-Disease
deep I-Disease

were O
not O
my O
