Terrific O
cramps O
in O
legs O
and O
awful O
and O
back O
for O
the O
last O
month O
at O
least O
. O
It O
lowered O
my O
LDL O
( O
not O
enough O
) O
but O
also O
lowered O
my O
HDL O
as O
well O
! O
! O
The O
ratio O
is O
not O
good O
! O
. O
I O
started O
taking O
about O
3 O
yrs O
. O
ago O
. O
I O
started O
at O
20. O
then O
my O
Dr O
doubled O
it O
to O
40 O
and O
kept O
wanting O
me O
to O
double O
it O
again O
to O
80 O
. O
After O
me O
telling O
him O
for O
months O
I O
would O
not O
do O
this O
. O
I O
gave O
it O
( O
about O
2 O
months O
ago O
) O
but O
decided O
to O
go O
to O
60 O
rather O
than O
80 O
. O
Well O
, O
let O
me O
tell O
you O
after O
taking O
this O
increased O
dosage O
for O
about O
two O
months O
I O
've O
had O
such O
and O
my O
back O
and O
also O
. O
I O
finally O
went O
to O
see O
a O
Dr O
in O
Urgent O
Care O
as O
the O
was O
so O
severe O
. O
He O
examined O
me O
and O
could O
not O
find O
any O
swellings O
etc O
and O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
had O
done O
anything O
different O
with O
my O
meds O
. O
I O
told O
him O
I O
had O
increased O
the O
and O
he O
suggested O
that O
I O
stop O
taking O
it O
ASAP O
. O
I O
only O
stopped O
taking O
it O
last O
night O
and O
I O
am O
anticipating O
that O
I O
will O
feel O
better O
( O
I O
like O
to O
be O
physical O

do O
lots O

really O
scaring O
me O
because O
my O
father O
had O
's O
. O
Also O
, O
in O
the O
last O
couple O
of O
days O
, O
I O
have O
started O
to O
get O
. O
I O
have O
not O
had O
my O
cholesterol O
tested O
since O
I O
started O
taking O
it O
; O
but O
I O
am O
stopping O
it O
today O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
work O
great O
for O
some O
people O
. O
But O
everyone O
should O
be O
very O
vigilant O
and O
check O
out O
any O
changes O
immediately O
. O
It O
is O
too O
easy O
to O
attribute O
a O
change O
to O
a O
pulled O
muscle O
or O
aging O
, O
etc O

for O
all O

out O

also O
destroys O

for O

what O

If O
you O

you O

I O

your O

no O

now O
on O

feeling O

Why O
am O
I O
on O

because O
the O
insurance O
company O
required O
a O
trial O
at O
this O
high O
level O
, O
before O
I O
can O
switch O
to O
an O
alternative O

reduce O
the O

Since O
when O
did O
the O

go O
to O

so O
they O
can O
dictate O
what O
I O
should O

'll O
not O

DRUG O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
! O
. O
I O
was O
put O
on O
this O
drug O
by O
my O
doctor O
for O
my O
somewhat O
High B-Disease
cholesterol I-Disease
- I-Disease
. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
after O
starting O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
suddenly O
I B-Disease
felt I-Disease
that I-Disease
i I-Disease
had I-Disease
aged I-Disease
overnight I-Disease
to I-Disease
about I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old. I-Disease
but O
did O
not O
connect O
it O
to O
starting O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
I B-Disease
have I-Disease
felt I-Disease
all I-Disease
that I-Disease
your I-Disease
age I-Disease
caught I-Disease
up I-Disease
with I-Disease
you. I-Disease
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
I B-Disease
was I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old. I-Disease
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
Hypochondriac B-Disease
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
Eighty B-Disease
old I-Disease
feeling. I-Disease
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O
pill O
can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O
recovering O
like O
I O
did O
the O
first O
time O
. O
This O
has O
ruined O
my O
life O
and O
I O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
if O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
know O
now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O
permanent O
damage O
. O
My O
doctor O
, O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
this O
, O
wanted O
to O
change O
statins O
because O
he O
was O
still O
worried O
about O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
I O
told O
him O
no O
more O
statins O
and O
he O
then O
prescribed O
Zetia B-Drug
, O
which O
he O
said O
was O
was O
less O
effective O
but O
was O
not O
a O
statin O
, O
which O
I O
am O
still O
afraid O
to O
take O
unless O
I O
improve O
from O
the O
affects O
of O
the O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
. O
He O
told O
me O
he O
was O
on O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
himself O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problems O
but O
then O
said O
, O
well O
he O
did O
have O
The B-Disease
neck I-Disease
pains. I-Disease
that O
could O
have O
been O
a O
side O
affect O
, O
but O
that O
he O
had O
been O
on O

of I-Disease

overnight. I-Disease

Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O

Feeling B-Disease
all I-Disease
that I-Disease
age I-Disease
caught I-Disease
up I-Disease
with I-Disease
you I-Disease
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
Lipitor B-Drug
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
i B-Disease
was I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old. I-Disease
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
Lipitor B-Drug
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
Hypochondriac B-Disease

I O
never O
read O

so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O

a O
year O
later O
I O
am O

. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
after O
starting O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
suddenly O
but O
did O
not O
connect O
it O
to O
starting O
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O
pill O
can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O
recovering O
like O
I O
did O
the O
first O
time O
. O
This O
has O
ruined O
my O
life O
and O
I O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
if O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
know O
now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O
permanent O
damage O
. O
My O
doctor O
, O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
this O
, O
wanted O
to O
change O
statins O
because O
he O
was O
still O
worried O
about O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
I O
told O
him O
no O
more O
statins O
and O
he O
then O
prescribed O
, O
which O
he O
said O
was O
was O
less O
effective O
but O
was O
not O
a O
statin O
, O
which O
I O
am O
still O
afraid O
to O
take O
unless O
I O
improve O
from O
the O
affects O
of O
the O
. O
He O
told O
me O
he O
was O
on O
himself O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problems O
but O
then O
said O
, O
well O
he O
did O
have O
that O
could O
have O
been O
a O
side O
affect O
, O
but O
that O
he O
had O
been O
on O
the O
drug O
two O
years O
before O
this O
developed O
. O
I O
told O
him O
of O
the O
information O
on O
this O
site O
that O
describes O
some O
people O
having O
that O
delayed O
reaction O
and O
I O
advised O
him O
to O
take O
himself O
off O
of O
this O
drug O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
the O
neck O
pains O
cleared O
up O

NOT O

After O
being O
off O

this O
medication O
for O
only O
48 O
hours O
, O
I O
am O
already O
beginning O
to O
see O
an O
improvement O
in O
my O
moods O
, O
but O
this O
will O
be O
a O
long O
journey O
back O
to O
my O
old O
self O
, O
I O
feel O
. O
Oh O
yes O
, O
and O
I O
also O
suffered O
from O
: O
Gazette B-Disease
, O
Constipation B-Disease
: I-Disease
, O
EXTREME O
She B-Disease
felt I-Disease
fatigue I-Disease
, O
Weight B-Disease
gain I-Disease
and O
Bloating B-Disease
, O
and O
occassional O
bouts O
of O
Diaharrea B-Disease
. O
It O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
. O
But O
it O
also O
significantly O
lowered O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
This O
website O
has O
been O
an O
absolute O
lifeline O
for O
me O
. O
My O
doctor O
had O
seemed O
so O
completely O
unwilling O
to O
accept O
that O
my O
symptoms O
could O
've O
possibly O
been O
related O
to O
my O
taking O
Lipitor B-Drug
- I-Drug
. O
However O
, O
I O
know O
my O
body O
and O
know O
when O
things O
are O
not O
as O
they O
should O
be O
. O
I O
have O
been O
feeling O
this O
way O
since O
almost O
immediately O
after O
I O
took O
my O
first O
dose O
. O
Hearing O
that O
so O
many O
other O
people O
have O
experienced O
the O
same O
exact O
symptoms O
as O
me O
has O
given O
me O
the O
courage O
needed O
to O
STOP O
this O
medication O
. O
So O
many O
of O
my O
family O
members O
and O
friends O
have O
had O
bad O
reactions O
to O
this O
stuff- O
I O
can O
not O
trust O
it O
, O
and O
will O
be O
looking O
for O
another O
way O
to O
get O
my O
cholesterol O
under O
control O
, O
if O
possible O
. O
Be O
very O
careful O
and O
very O
informed O
before O
you O
start O
any O
new O
medication O
. O
Do O
n't O
always O
trust O
the O
word O
of O
your O

a O

I O
thought O

I O
was O
prescribed O

This O
was O
a O
big O
relief O
, O
as O
the O
1200 O
MG O
of O

had O
taken O
throughout O

I O
still O

I O

up O
this O
morning O
with O

my O
period O
ended O

I O
was O
relieved O
to O
read O
that O
this O
could O
be O
a O
side O
effect O
, O
as O
it O
means O
I O
probably O
do O
n't O
have O
something O
serious O

I O
will O
have O
to O
be O

I O

this O

My O
already O
Snooze-filled B-Disease
muscles I-Disease
, O
over O
