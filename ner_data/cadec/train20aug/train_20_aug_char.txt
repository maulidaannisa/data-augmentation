The O

I O
could O

out O

I O
asked O

Recently O
I O

The O

I O

I O

The O

I O
started O
to O
take O
I O
had O
the O
chest B-Disease
ache I-Disease
, O
confirmed O
to O
be O
muscular O
by O
doctors O
. O
At O
the O
start O
of O
the O
second O
week O
, O
I O
accidentally O
took O
a O
dose O
in O
the O
morning O
instead O
of O
the O
night O
because O
I O
took O
the O
wrong O
pill O
( O
skipped O
the O
night O
dose O
) O
. O
The O
day O
after O
I O
started O
to O
have O
the O
other O
symptons O
. O
The O
worst O
one O
- O
the O
mouth O
one O
has O
faded O
, O
but O
the O
others O
remain O
. O
I O
found O
out O
too O
late O
grapefruit O
juice O
can O
make O
this O
drug O
stronger O
. O
I O
drank O
it O
some O
days O
during O
the O
first O
2 O
weeks O
. O
Stopped O
drinking O
it O
. O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
third O
week O
I O
took O
50mg O
of O
coq10 B-Drug
per O
day O
for O
3 O
days O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
sense O
an O
improvement O
, O
but O
after O
stopping O
for O
other O
three O
days O
I O
will O
try O
again O
. O
( O
I O
need O
better O
evidence O
before O
buying O
a O
can O
of O
doq10 B-Drug
, O
it O
is O
very O
expensive O
and O
hard O
to O
find O
around O
here O
) O
. O
Will O
beg O
my O
cardiologist O
to O
let O
me O
try O
natural O
exercise O
before O
continuing O
statins O
. O
Giving O
it O
a O

because O
it O
was O
effective O
, O
in O
a O
single O
month O
and O
with O
ezetimibe B-Drug
and O
exercise O
all O
my O
numbers O
are O
in O
very O
