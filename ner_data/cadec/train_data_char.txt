I O
found O
that O
vo/taren B-Drug

, O
i O
rarely O

i O
find O
it O
never O

takes O
too O
long O

take O
affect O

just O
`` O

As O
i O
am O
only O
young O

relatively O
healthy O
i O
did O
not O

HOWEVER O
my O
parents O
both O
have O
had O
bad O
side O

i O

you O

Otherwise O
if O

you O
are O

the O

( O
SOOOOOO O
not O
my O

. O
I O
was O
blaming O
my O
antiniotic B-Drug
for O
these O
side O
effects O
, O

now O
I O
see O
that O
they O
come O

go O
with O
the O
use O
of O
the O
solaraze B-Drug
. O
Scary O
. O
LEt O
me O
be O
the O
first O
to O
say O
that O
I O
have O
extremely O
porous O
skin O
, O
so O
I O
am O
probably O
absorbing O
a O
higher O
dose O
than O
was O
thought O
likely O
, O
I O
have O
ecse,a B-Disease
and O
take O
other O
meds O
that O
exfoliate O
my O
skin O
, O
so O
probably O
a O
whopping O
dose O
is O
going O
in O
. O
I O
have O
found O
that O
I O
can O
use O
a O
q-tip O
and O
just O
put O
it O
on O
a O
few O
spots O
and O
then O
do O
not O
get O
the O
global O
bad O
effect O
, O
so O
I O
may O
do O
it O
this O
way O
and O
just O
treat O
one O
arm O
at O
a O
time O
, O
then O
one O
leg O

so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O
stop O
taking O
the O
lipitor B-Drug
. O

Within O
a O
week O
or O
two O
of O
taking O
the O
prescribe O
dose O
, O
I O
began O
developing O
something O
I O
never O
had O
before O
: O
eczeja B-Disease
. O
It O
became O
progressively O
worse O
, O
and O
by O
the O
end O
of O
the O
first O
month O
had O
created O
a O
mazsive B-Disease
trianri.ar I-Disease
rach I-Disease
on I-Disease
my I-Disease
forehdad I-Disease
, O
as O
well O
as O

. O
The O
skin B-Disease
qas I-Disease
very I-Disease
rex I-Disease
and I-Disease
tough I-Disease
, O
and O
made O
public O
life O
miserable O
and O
embarassing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
ljpitor B-Drug
and O
the O
rast B-Disease
cleared O
up O
greatly O
, O
but O
has O
NEVER O
gone O
away O
completly O
, O
flaring O
up O
slightly O
from O
time O
to O
time O
, O
but O
not O
nearly O
as O
bad O
as O
it O
was O
during O
dosing O
with O
lipitor B-Drug
. O
I O
was O
not O
taking O
any O
other O

at O
the O

The O
anti-lipid O

unusually O
strong O
in O

2 O
weeks O
of O
dosing O
, O
my O

had O
me O
cutting O
the O
smallest O

half O
to O
be O
taken O
once O
a O
day O
. O
Even O
so O
, O
the O
raah B-Disease
continued O
to O
enlarge O
and O
get O
worse O
, O
so O
I O
was O
forced O
to O

I O
started O
to O
have O
the O
other O
symptons O
. O
The O
worst O
one O
- O
the O
mouth O
one O
has O
faded O
, O
but O
the O
others O
remain O
. O
I O
found O
out O
too O
late O
grapefruit O
juice O
can O
make O
this O
drug O
stronger O
. O
I O
drank O
it O
some O
days O
during O
the O
first O
2 O
weeks O
. O
Stopped O
drinking O
it O
. O
At O
the O
beginning O
of O
third O
week O
I O
took O
50mg O
of O
coq10 B-Drug
per O
day O
for O
3 O
days O
. O
I O
could O
n't O
sense O
an O
improvement O
, O
but O
after O
stopping O
for O
other O
three O
days O
I O
will O
try O
again O
. O
( O
I O
need O
better O
evidence O
before O
buying O
a O
can O
of O
coq10 B-Drug
, O
it O
is O
very O
expensive O
and O
hard O
to O
find O
around O
here O
) O
. O
Will O
beg O
my O
cardiologist O
to O
let O
me O
try O
natural O
exercise O
before O
continuing O
statins O
. O
Giving O
it O
a O
3 O
, O
because O
it O
was O
effective O
, O
in O
a O
single O
month O
and O
with O
wzetimige B-Drug
and O
exercise O
all O
my O
numbers O
are O
in O
very O
safe O
ranges O
. O
Please O
be O
careful O
about O
natural O
supplements O
. O
Homeopathy O
simply O
does O
not O
work O
- O
it O
is O
just O
water O
- O
The O
supplements O
that O
do O
work O
may O
also O
have O
side O
effects O
, O
just O
like O
the O
drugs O
. O
Red O
Yeast O
Rice O
, O
for O
example O
, O
actually O
contains O
a O
statin O
( O
lovawtatkn B-Drug
) O
, O
so O
it O
will O
most O
likely O
have O
all O
the O
set O
of O
side O
effects O
as O
the O
other O
statins O
. O

The O

I O
suddenly O
fe1t B-Disease
like I-Disease
i I-Disease

uverni9ht I-Disease

Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
feeling B-Disease
all I-Disease
that I-Disease
a9e I-Disease
caught I-Disease
up I-Disease
with I-Disease
yuu I-Disease
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
lipit0k B-Drug
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
lipituk B-Drug
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
i B-Disease
was I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
o1d I-Disease
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
1ipitok B-Drug
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
hypuch0ndkiac B-Disease
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
eighty B-Disease
year8 I-Disease
old I-Disease
feeling I-Disease
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O

can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O

I O
did O
the O

This O
has O

I O
knew O
what O
I O

now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O

damage O
. O
My O
doctor O
, O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
this O
, O
wanted O
to O
change O

still O
worried O
about O
my O

. O
I O
told O
him O
no O
more O
statins O
and O
he O
then O
prescribed O
2etia B-Drug
, O
which O
he O
said O
was O
was O
less O
effective O
but O
was O
not O
a O
statin O

which O
I O
am O
still O
afraid O
to O
take O
unless O
I O
improve O
from O
the O

He O
told O
me O
he O
was O
on O
lipituk B-Drug
himself O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problems O
but O
then O
said O
, O
well O
he O

that O
he O
had O

I O
told O

The O
next O

, O
after O
starting O
this O

, O
I O
suddenly O
fwit B-Disease
liie I-Disease

opd I-Disease

but O
did O
not O
connect O
it O
to O
starting O
lipitoe B-Drug
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
feeling B-Disease
wll I-Disease
thah I-Disease
ags I-Disease
vaught I-Disease
up I-Disease
with I-Disease
you I-Disease
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
liputor B-Drug
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
;ipitor B-Drug
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
i B-Disease
was I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
jears I-Disease
old I-Disease
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
liliror B-Drug
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
hyposhondriwc B-Disease
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
dighty B-Disease
jfars I-Disease
old I-Disease
feeling I-Disease
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O
pill O
can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O
recovering O
like O
I O
did O
the O
first O
time O
. O
This O
has O
ruined O
my O
life O
and O
I O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
lipitof B-Drug
if O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
know O
now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O
permanent O
damage O
. O
My O
doctor O
, O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
this O
, O
wanted O
to O

I O

then O
said O

: O
What O
is O
the O

There O
were O

( O
28 O
% O
of O
the O

Only O
coronary O

reported O
for O
women O
, O
but O
when O
these O
were O
pooled O
they O
were O
not O
reduced O
by O
statin O
therapy O
, O
RR O
0.98 O
[ O
0.85-1.12 O
] O
. O
Thus O
the O
coronary O

in O

appears O
to O
be O

diahargea B-Disease
. O
It O
lowered O
my O
cholesterol O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
. O
But O
it O
also O
significantly O
lowered O
my O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
This O
website O
has O
been O
an O
absolute O
lifeline O
for O
me O
. O
My O
doctor O
had O
seemed O
so O
completely O
unwilling O
to O
accept O
that O
my O
symptoms O
could O
've O
possibly O
been O
related O
to O
my O
taking O
li;itpr B-Drug
. O
However O
, O
I O
know O
my O
body O
and O
know O
when O
things O
are O
not O
as O
they O
should O
be O
. O
I O
have O
been O
feeling O
this O
way O
since O
almost O
immediately O
after O
I O
took O
my O
first O
dose O
. O
Hearing O
that O
so O
many O
other O
people O
have O
experienced O
the O
same O
exact O
symptoms O
as O
me O
has O
given O
me O
the O
courage O
needed O
to O
STOP O
this O
medication O
. O
So O
many O
of O
my O
family O
members O
and O
friends O
have O
had O
bad O
reactions O
to O
this O
stuff- O
I O
can O
not O
trust O
it O
, O
and O
will O
be O
looking O
for O
another O
way O
to O
get O
my O
cholesterol O
under O
control O
, O
if O
possible O
. O
Be O
very O
careful O
and O
very O
informed O
before O
you O
start O
any O
new O
medication O
. O
Do O
n't O
always O
trust O
the O
word O
of O
your O
doctor O
as O
the O
only O
word O
and O
take O
it O
at O
its O
face O
value O
. O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
your O
body O
, O
you O
have O
every O
right O
to O
dictate O
, O
understand O
, O
and O
call O
the O
shots O
about O
what O
does O
and O
does O
not O
go O
in O
to O
it O

I O

I O
asked O

Recently O
I O

and O
I O

I O
still O
had O
the O

I O

The O
question O
is O

this O
? O
I O
am O
taking O
20 O

others O
who O
can O
not O
find O
any O

, O
when O
I O
read O
about O
all O
these O
people O
who O
seem O
to O
have O
figured O
this O
out O
. O
I O
have O
hope O

But O
are O
they O
correct O
in O
thier O
assumptions O
? O
We O
are O
all O
desperate O
to O
find O
an O
answer O
( O
the O
cause O
) O
and O
ultimately O
a O
cure O
. O
But O
is O
lipit0k B-Drug
the O
answer O
? O
That O
is O

question O

For O

my O

so O
a O
( O
not O
my O

one O
) O
Dr O
just O
prescribed O
me O
1ipitok B-Drug

I O
did O

notice O
any O

for O
just O
over O
2 O

all O

a O

I O

I O
saw O
my O
regular O
Dr O

the O

, O
she O
also O
drew O
blood O

Luckily O
most O

the O

there O
was O
a O

I O
thought O
it O

and O
my O

were O
great O
as O
well O
. O
I O
ca O
n't O
say O
that O
the O

does O
n't O
work O

compared O
to O
how O
I O
feel O
it O

not O
with O
it O

I O
'll O
never O
take O
it O

fall O
asleep O
, O
usually O
when O
I O
wake O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
From O
month O
to O
month O
pain B-Disease
was O
worst O
until O
I O
almost O
lost B-Disease
all I-Disease
strength I-Disease
and O
could B-Disease
n't I-Disease
use I-Disease
my I-Disease
arm I-Disease
. O
Anyway O
, O
I O
think O
I O
made O
a O
good O
decision O
by O
not O
using O
lipitor B-Drug
anymore O
( O
my O
doctor O
will O
be O
mad O
at O
me O
) O
. O
I O
will O
try O
with O
natural O
supplements O
and O
more O
exercising O
. O
I O
am O
very O
`` O
anxious O
'' O
about O
medication O
that O
can O
cause O
myopathy B-Disease
, O
liver B-Disease
damage I-Disease
or O
cancer B-Disease
. O
. O

After O
using O
lipitor B-Drug
for O
2.5 O
years O
, O
I O
decided O
to O
stop O
two O
weeks O
ago O
because O
of O
severe O
pain O
in O
my O
left O
arm O
. O
I O
am O
left O
handed O
and O
recently O
could O
n't O
normally O
do O
my O
job O
. O
Twice O
I O
told O
my O
doctor O
about O
palj B-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
arm I-Disease
and O
he O
did O
n't O
take O
that O
seriously O
, O
ignoring O
my O
complaint O
. O
After O
two O
weeks O
of O
not O
taking O
lipitof B-Drug
my O
arm O
almost O
recovered O
and O
I O
can O
work O
without O
any O
pajn B-Disease
or O
any O
problem O
. O
It O
started O
a O
long O

, O
they O
were O
often O
