I O

for O
all O
the O

out O

For O
all O
of O
you O

a O

you O
never O

is O
able O
to O

also O
destroys O

your O

This O
is O
necessary O
for O

what O

If O

I O
would O

you O
do O
your O

this O
would O
tell O
you O
not O

get O
it O
all O

just O

mechanism O
which O
also O
destroys O
and O
depletes O
your O
bodies O
ability O
to O
make O
CoQ10 O
. O
This O
is O
necessary O
for O
they O
health O
of O
muscles O
and O
joints O
( O
that O
's O
why O
you O
are O
experiencing O
the O
pain B-Disease
in I-Disease
joints I-Disease
and O

in I-Disease
muscles I-Disease
) O
. O
Remember O
your O
heart O
is O
a O
muscle O
, O
guess O
what O
is O
happening O
to O
it O
with O
the O
depletion O
of O
the O
CoQ10 O
? O
? O
? O
If O
you O
do O
some O
research O
on O
the O
internet O
, O
you O
will O
find O
that O
all O
these O
statins O
make O
no O
claims/nor O
have O
studies O
shown O
them O
to O
reduce O
heart B-Disease
conditions I-Disease
, O
but O
they O
cause O
MUSCLE B-Disease
PAIN I-Disease
i.e O
. O
your O
heart O
, O
this O
is O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
they O
put O
younger O
and O
younger O
people O
on O
these O
drugs O
and O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
that O
you O
do O
your O
own O
research O
versus O
just O
listening O
to O
the O
doctor O
who O
wants O
your O
LDL O
down O
to O
like O
below O
130 O
, O
neurosurgeons O
, O
who O
have O
studied O
this O
would O
tell O
you O
not O
to O
get O
it O
all O
too O
low O
. O
And O
just O
because O
your O
test O
come O
back O
and O
show O
your O
liver O
functions O
are O
fine O
and O
do O
n't O
show O
any O
broken O
down O
muscle O
toxins O
in O
the O
blood O
does O
n't O
mean O
the O
lack O
of O
CoQ10 O
is O
n't O
breaking O
down O
and O
Severe B-Disease
muscle I-Disease

very O
slowly O
. O
Mine O
always O
showed O
fine O
and O
I O
had O
joint B-Disease
pain I-Disease
in I-Disease
my I-Disease
knees I-Disease
and O
hip O
joints O
( O
never O
had O
this O
in O
my O
life O
before O
statins O
) O
and O
bad O
muscle B-Disease
cramps I-Disease
in I-Disease
legs I-Disease
( O
also O
never O
got O
those O
until O
statins O
) O
. O
Granted O
is O
you O
have O
high O
blood O
pressure O
, O
liver B-Disease
enzymes I-Disease
were I-Disease
elevated I-Disease
, O
Weight B-Disease
gain I-Disease
and O
maybe O
smoke O
, O
then O
you O
probably O
need O
something O
to O
lower O
the O
LDL O
, O
if O
you O
only O
have O
high O
LDL O
, O
you O
do O
n't O

Read O
the O

Could O

Waited O
a O

3 O

not O

Went O

said O
stop O

on O
an O
off O
chanch O
it O
may O
be O
an O
uncommon O
reaction O
. O
I O
started O
looking O
up O
Lipidil B-Drug
reactions O
and O
came O
across O
so O
much O
info O
on O
side O
effects O
it O
was O
startling O
. O
I O
look O
back O
to O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
years O

when O
I O
no O
longer O
had O
that O
red B-Disease

all I-Disease
over I-Disease
my I-Disease
body I-Disease
and O
a O
lack B-Disease
of I-Disease
sexual I-Disease
drive I-Disease
( O
not O
typical O
for O
me O
) O
. O
At O
the O
time O
I O
attributed O
it O
to O
male O
menopause-being O
around O
54 O
. O
I O
went O
to O
my O
accupuncturist O
and O
was O
told O
my O
chee O
was O
dry O
. O
Had O
4 O
treatments O
over O
as O
many O
weeks O
. O
Started O
to O
see O
some O
improvement O
. O
At O
the O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
would O
imagine O
someone O
that O
had O
MD B-Disease
symptoms I-Disease
would O
feel O
like O
, O
diffuculty B-Disease
thinking I-Disease
, O
pulling O
myself O
up O

, O
Developed B-Disease
sore I-Disease

. O
After O
having O
stopped O

, O
I O
would O
say O
I O
am O
at O
about O
50 O
or O
55 O
% O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
continue O
to O
keep O
getting O
better O
as O
this O
has O
really O
hit O
my O
life O
at O
a O
bad O
time O
. O
My O

did O
go O
down O

If O

I O
was O
put O
on O
this O

by O
my O
doctor O
for O
my O
somewhat O
Cholesterol B-Disease
went I-Disease
up I-Disease
. O
The O
next O
day O
, O
after O
starting O
this O
drug O
, O
I O
suddenly O
I B-Disease
was I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old I-Disease
but O
did O
not O
connect O
it O
to O
starting O
Lipitors B-Drug
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
felt B-Disease
much I-Disease
older I-Disease
than I-Disease
I I-Disease
was I-Disease
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
Lipitors B-Drug
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
Lipitors B-Drug
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
felt B-Disease
like I-Disease
I I-Disease
had I-Disease
aged I-Disease
to I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old I-Disease
overnight I-Disease
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
Lipitors B-Drug
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
transient B-Disease
hyperthyroidism I-Disease
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
I B-Disease
was I-Disease
eighty I-Disease
years I-Disease
old I-Disease
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O

can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O
recovering O
like O
I O
did O
the O
first O
time O

This O
has O
ruined O
my O
life O

I O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
Lipitors B-Drug
if O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
know O
now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O
permanent O
damage O

My O
doctor O
, O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
this O
, O
wanted O
to O
change O

still O
worried O
about O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
I O
told O
him O
no O
more O
statins O
and O
he O
then O
prescribed O
Zyrtec B-Drug
, O
which O
he O
said O
was O
was O
less O
effective O
but O
was O
not O
a O
statin O
, O
which O
I O
am O
still O
afraid O
to O
take O
unless O
I O
improve O
from O
the O

He O
told O
me O
he O
was O
on O
Lipitors B-Drug
himself O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problems O
but O
then O
said O

well O
he O
did O
have O

that O
could O
have O

that O
he O
had O

two O

it O
to O
starting O
LIP B-Drug
. O
Up O
until O
the O
start O
of O
this O
drug O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
as O
young O
as O
I O
was O
in O
my O
twenties O
and O
wondered O
if O
this O
is O
how O
you O
might O
start O
feeling O
the O
affects O
of O
age O
, O
by O
waking O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
very B-Disease
fatigued I-Disease
and O
now O
you O
were O
older O
than O
your O
years O
. O
I O
took O
the O
drug O
for O
two O
terrible O
months O
and O
then O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
and O
my O
cholesterol O
had O
dropped O
. O
My O
doctor O
mailed O
me O
the O
results O
of O
my O
blood O
test O
but O
did O
not O
send O
me O
a O
new O
prescription O
like O
he O
had O
the O
last O
time O
so O
I O
did O
not O
know O
that O
he O
wanted O
me O
to O
get O
it O
refilled O
. O
So O
I O
went O
off O
of O
LIP B-Drug
and O
within O
two O
months O
I O
was O
feeling O
normal O
again O
and O
even O
took O
a O
job O
with O
the O
post O
office O
where O
I O
walked O
five O
miles O
a O
day O
with O
no O
problem O
. O
I O
did O
not O
associate O
my O
getting O
better O
with O
my O
coming O
off O
LIP B-Drug
, O
unfortunately O
. O
Then O
I O
had O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
doctor O
and O
he O
said O
I O
should O
have O
refilled O
that O
prescription O
by O
calling O
his O
office O
. O
So O
I O
did O
and O
the O
next O
day O
, O
after O
taking O
only O
one O
pill O
, O
Feel B-Disease
as I-Disease
if I-Disease
I I-Disease
was I-Disease
90 I-Disease
years I-Disease
old I-Disease
again O
. O
This O
time O
I O
did O
associate O
it O
with O
the O
start O
of O
LIP B-Drug
and O
then O
read O
the O
warnings O
the O
drug O
store O
gives O
you O
with O
meds O
and O
found O
that O
my O
symptoms O
were O
the O
same O
as O
what O
they O
warned O
against O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
hypersensitive B-Disease
and O
I O
never O
read O
those O
warnings O
so O
this O
was O
not O
a O
head O
thing O
. O
I O
immediately O
went O
off O
the O
drug O
but O
a O
year O
later O
I O
am O
still O
have O
the O
same O
passed B-Disease
a I-Disease
8mm I-Disease
stone I-Disease
and O
do O
not O
know O
that O
I O
will O
ever O
be O
normal O
again O
. O
I O
do O
not O
understand O
how O
just O
one O
pill O
can O
do O
that O
and O
this O
time O
I O
am O
not O
recovering O
like O
I O
did O
the O
first O
time O
. O
This O
has O
ruined O
my O
life O
and O
I O
would O
never O
have O
taken O
LIP B-Drug
if O
I O
knew O
what O
I O
know O
now O
and O
I O
am O
so O
sorry O
that O
I O
ever O
heard O
of O
this O
drug O
. O
This O
is O
so O
severe O
that O
I O
think O
taking O
it O
for O
even O
a O
short O
time O
can O
cause O
permanent O
damage O
. O
My O
doctor O
, O
when O
I O
told O
him O
of O
all O
this O
, O
wanted O
to O
change O
statins O
because O
he O
was O
still O
worried O
about O
my O
cholesterol O
. O
I O
told O
him O
no O
more O
statins O
and O
he O
then O
prescribed O
zinc B-Drug
, O
which O
he O
said O
was O
was O
less O
effective O
but O
was O
not O
a O
statin O
, O
which O
I O
am O
still O
afraid O
to O
take O
unless O
I O
improve O
from O
the O
affects O
of O
the O

He O
told O
me O
he O
was O
on O
LIP B-Drug
himself O
and O
that O
he O
had O
no O
problems O
but O
then O
said O
, O
well O
he O
did O
have O
neck B-Disease

that O
could O
have O
been O
a O
side O

, O
but O
that O
he O
had O
been O
on O
the O

two O
years O
before O

I O
told O

for O
me O
seems O
to O
be O
really O
good O

Some O
stomach O
irritation O
, O
feels O
a O
bit O
like O
my O
pulse B-Disease
was I-Disease
high I-Disease
( O
in O
my O
head O
mostly O
) O
. O
I O
pulled O
my O
lower O
back O
at O
the O
gym O
2 O
times O
. O
last O
time O
was O
about O
1 O
1/2 O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
was O
pretty O
bad O
. O
Since O
then O
my O
back O
has O
really O
gotten O
worse O
. O
I O
still O
exercise O
everyday O
and O
stretch O
, O
but O
it O
really O
is O
not O
helping O
. O
I O
final O
went O
to O
the O
doctor O
and O
i O
am O
getting O
x-rays O
on O
my O
spine O
tomorrow O
. O
He O
gave O
me O
about O
25 O
samples O
of O
arthotec B-Drug

3 O

I O
can O
not O
believe O
how O
good O
my O
back O
feels O
. O
It O
has O
to O
be O
this O
drub O
, O
because O
this O
is O
the O
first O
day O
i O
can O
comfortably O
bend O
down O
with O
no O
severe B-Disease
pain I-Disease
and O
even O
touch O
my O
toes O
without O
bending O
my O
knees O
. O
It O
seems O
that O
this O
drug O
, O
like O
many O
drugs O
, O
works O
for O
some O
and O
not O
for O
all O
. O
as O
for O
me O
seems O
to O
be O
really O
good O
. O

What O
is O
the O

? O
There O
were O
10,990 O

( O
28 O
% O

Only O

were O
reported O
for O
women O
, O
but O
when O
these O
were O
pooled O
they O
were O
not O
reduced O
by O
statin O
therapy O
, O
RR O
0.98 O
[ O
0.85-1.12 O
] O
. O
Thus O
the O
coronary O
benefit O
in O
primary O
prevention O

appears O
to O
be O
limited O
to O

I O

Leg B-Disease

at O

with O
the O
bladder B-Disease
irritants I-Disease
and O
stomach O
as O
well O
. O
The O
Strong B-Disease
pain I-Disease
was O
so O
bad O
I O
could O
not O
get O
out O

the O
bed O
and O
had O
to O
crawl O
to O
get O
to O
the O
bathroom O
to O
take O
Vitamins B-Drug
A I-Drug
. O
I O
asked O
my O
doctor O
what O
could O
have O
caused O
this O
and O
he O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
from O
the O
Lipitors B-Drug
. O
Recently O
I O
experienced O
extreme O
stomach B-Disease
pains I-Disease
that O
stretched O
to O
my O
side O
and O
back O
. O
The O
stomach B-Disease
pains I-Disease
came O
suddenly O
and O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
for O
a O
week O
before O
it O
became O
so O
bad O
I O
can B-Disease
not I-Disease
sleep I-Disease
. O
I O
had O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
urinary B-Disease
tract I-Disease
infection I-Disease
( O
one O
of O
the O
side-effects O
) O
and O
I O
thought O
it O
had O
returned O
but O
the O
symptoms O
were O
different O
. O
I O
still O
had O
the O
urge B-Disease
to I-Disease
urinate I-Disease
constantly I-Disease
constantly O
but O
it O
would O
come O
and O
go O
and O
I O
would O
have O
no O
symptoms O
for O
a O
day O
then O
it O
would O
return O
again O
. O
I O
remembered O
reading O
the O
phamplet O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
prescription O
drugs O
and O
it O
mentioning O
some O
of O
symptoms O
that O
I O
was O
experiencing O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
the O
Lipitors B-Drug
for O
a O
day O
and O
I O
did O
not O
have O
any O
more O
stomach B-Disease
pains I-Disease
or O
agitated B-Disease
. O
I O
also O
had O
been O
experiencing O
have B-Disease
no I-Disease
energy I-Disease
for O
quite O
some O
time O
and O
I O
attributed O
this O
to O
stressing B-Disease
but O
after O
reading O
this O
website O
I O
feel O
it O
was O
due O
to O

the O

pretty O

eliminated O

This O
was O
a O
big O

, O
as O
the O
1200 O
MG O
of O

I O
had O
taken O

I O
only O
took O
1 O

I O

it O

I O

my O

I O
was O
relieved O
to O
read O
that O
this O
could O
be O
a O
side O
effect O
, O
as O
it O
means O
I O
probably O
do O
n't O
have O
something O
serious O
, O

I O
will O
have O
to O
be O
in O
