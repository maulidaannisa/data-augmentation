Caretaker O
suspects O
that O
her O
loss B-DIS
of I-DIS
appetite I-DIS
is O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
Donepezil B-DRUG
Aricept B-DRUG
as O
her O
symptom O
began O
shortly O
after O
her O
dosage O
for O
the O
drug O
was O
increased O
by O
the O
doc O
. O
The O
doc O
doesn O
t O
want O
to O
decrease O
the O
dosage O
because O
he O
thinks O
that O
the O
medication O
won O
t O
be O
as O
effective O
in O
dealing O
with O
numerous O
other O
health O
issues O
. O
We O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
to O
do O
. O

My O
hyper-fixations B-DIS
are O
really O
embarrassing O
. O
I O
ll O
think O
and O
daydream O
about O
and O
reference O
my O
particular O
obsession O
constantly O
- O
it O
s O
hard O
not O
to O
openly O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
but O
sometimes O
when O
the O
topic O
is O
brought O
up O
I O
can O
t O
stop O
talking O
. O

Ugh O
, O
when O
you O
have O
frequency B-DIS
like O
that O
it O
s O
hard O
to O
get O
anything O
done O
. O
One O
thing O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
supplements O
is O
that O
in O
the O
US O
there O
s O
no O
regulation O
on O
them O
. O
Sometimes O
companies O
won O
t O
put O
the O
actual O
active O
ingredient O
in O
the O
compound O
, O
or O
they O
ll O
include O
additives O
that O
are O
bladder B-DIS
irritants I-DIS
and O
not O
disclose O
them O
. O
Even O
reputable O
brands O
can O
be O
subject O
to O
variation O
if O
they O
change O
warehouses O
or O
plants O
. O
If O
you O
re O
still O
having O
horrible B-DIS
frequency I-DIS
, O
you O
might O
want O
to O
experiment O
with O
your O
supplements O
as O
well O
as O
your O
diet O
. O
They O
can O
be O
a O
trigger O
. O

No O
worries O
When O
I O
started O
out O
I O
thought O
for O
sure O
I O
would O
have O
plenty O
of O
help O
and O
support O
both O
in O
finances O
and O
in O
nursing O

to O
give O
me O
respite O

Shocking O
how O
wrong O
I O
was O
. O
It O
s O
incredible O
because O
unless O
you O
re O
very O
very O
wealthy O
there O
is O
a O
good O
chance O
you O
or O
your O
loved O
one O
is O
going O
to O
fall O
between O
the O
cracks O
and O
end O
up O
suffering O
through O
the O
last O
years O
of O
life O
. O
Before O
we O
were O
able O
to O
move O
back O
home O
with O
dad O
we O
let O
the O
state O
take O
guardianship O
of O
him O
assuming O
they O
would O
keep O
him O
safe O
and O
fed O
and O
sort O
out O
his O
money O
issues O
. O
Biggest O
mistake O
ever O
. O
They O
left O
him O
at O
his O

we O
asked O
for O
a O
nursing O
home O
with O
no O

no O

left O
his O
bills O

six O

Our O
lender O
was O
drawing O
up O

by O
the O
time O
I O
was O
appointed O

Massive O
nightmare O
on O
many O

Something O

so O
that O

People O
with O

don O
t O
taste O
things O
as O
well O
as O
they O
used O
to O
. O
That O
s O
why O
they O
like O
food O
with O
lots O
of O

and O
sweet O
foods O
. O
When O
the O

want O
to O
eat O
more O

You O

Tips O
to O
try O
1 O
. O
Eat O
in O
a O
quiet O
and O
calm O
room O
so O
she O
doesn O
t O
get O
distracted O
. O
2 O
. O
Eat O
meals O
together O
-- O
she O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
eat O
. O
3 O
. O
Add O
in O
protein O
with O
eggs O
, O
puddings O
made O
with O
milk O
, O
or O
protein O
powder O
. O
4 O
. O
Cut O
food O
into O
small O
pieces O
so O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
chew O
. O
5 O
. O
Mash O
vegetables O
and O
make O
a O
smoothie O
or O
shake O
. O
6 O
. O
Make O
soups O
and O
stews O
-- O
everything O
in O
the O
stew O
gets O
the O
flavor O
of O
meat O
, O
but O
she O
gets O
the O
vitamins O
from O
the O
vegetables O
and O
beans O
. O
7 O
. O
Try O
adding O
lots O
of O
herbs O
so O
the O
food O
tastes O
stronger O
. O
You O
said O
she O
has O
diabetes O
and O
should O
avoid O
sweets O
. O
She O
only O
has O
a O
few O
years O
left O
to O
live O
. O
I O
think O
you O
should O
give O
her O
sweets O
if O
her O
makes O
her O
happy O
. O
If O
her O
diabetes O
gets O
worse O
, O
it O
s O
okay O
. O

My O
entire O
fourth O
grade O
year O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
couldn O
t O
do O
anything O
physical O
without O
getting O
exauhsted O
, O
was O
failing O
every O
class O
and O
was O
just O
miserable O
. O
That O
summer O
me O
and O
my O
dad O
went O
backpacking O
and O
he O
mocked O
that O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
restroom O
every O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
due O
to O
the O
water O
. O
This O
was O
followed O
by O
the O
next O
week O
of O
me O
doing O
nothing O
but O
sitting O
on O
the O
couch O
sneaking O
spoonfuls O
of O
sugar O
till O
my O
mom O
noticed O
I O
lost B-DIS
a I-DIS
lot I-DIS
of I-DIS
weight I-DIS
and O
took O
me O
to O
emergency O
care O
. O
Was O

fun O

long-term O

has O
largely O

Nothing O
wrong O
with O

they O
have O
preconceived O

about O

The O

I O

a O

I O
got O
a O
free O
trial O

. O
It O
s O
kind O
of O
ideal O
for O
that O
kind O
of O
situation O
- O
it O
s O
mellow O
, O
you O
can O
tune O
it O
out O
or O
concentrate O
on O
it O
as O
you O
like O
and O
still O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
up O

, O
there O
s O
lots O

doesn O
t O
work O

I O
can O
take O
it O
and O
I O
m O
fairly O
sensitive O
to O
drugs O
. O
Definitely O
worth O
a O
go O
, O
just O
start O
with O
10mg O
maximum O
. O

I O
had O
one O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
ago O
. O
The O
lady O
that O
started O
it O
right O
before O
me O
got O
to O
go O
at O
2 O
hours O
because O
her O
stomach O
emptied O
quickly O
. O
At O
3 O
hours O
I O
was O
told O
it O
looked O
like O
I O
just O
ate O
so O
I O
had O
to O
stay O
for O
4 O
. O
I O
d O
ask O
the O
gastroenterologist O
to O
see O
what O
they O
found O

discuss O
your O

No-Spa B-DRUG
has O
no O
side O
effect O
. O
I O
was O
on O
opiates B-DRUG
for O
backpain B-DIS
and O
didn O
t O
shit O
for O
6 O
days O
. O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
in O
1991 O
. O
It O
took O
many O
years O
of O
trial O
and O
error O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
managed O
to O
find O
a O
diet O
that O
works O
really O
well O
for O
me O
vegan O
, O
low O
fat O
and O
thankfully O
live O
where O
marijuana O
is O
legal O
and O
high O
CBD O
tinctures O
help O
me O
keep O
pain B-DIS
in O
an O
acceptable O
baseline O
level O
. O
Since O
about O
2002 O
I O
ve O
had O
fewer O
trips O
to O
the O
hospital O
than O
I O
did O
any O
year O
in O
the O
decade O
before O
, O
and O
I O
ve O
become O
much O
better O
about O
pain B-DIS
management O
, O
including O
taking O
two O
mindfulness O
meditation O
courses O
targeting O
pain B-DIS
and O
anxiety B-DIS
. O
I O
think O
I O
would O
tell O
someone O
in O
your O
position O
that O
you O
still O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
options O
to O
explore O
, O
and O
depending O
on O
where O
you O
live O
and O
what O
your O
insurance O
situation O
is O
like O
I O
would O
hope O
that O
the O
desperation O
you O
can O
sometimes O
feel O
could O
be O
channeled O
as O
a O
motivation O
to O
try O
new O
, O
even O
unorthodox O
approaches O
I O
felt O
silly O
going O
to O
an O
acupuncturist O
, O
and O
I O
don O
t O
think O
it O
helped O
with O
the O
pain O
directly O
but O
it O
was O
a O
very O
calming O
and O
comfortable O
experience O
that O
led O
me O
to O
the O
mindfulness O
meditation O
courses O
at O
the O
same O
clinic O
. O

I O
thought O
I O
could O
ask O
here O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
flaring B-DIS
up I-DIS
so O
much O
these O
past O
2 O
weeks O
. O
And O
I O
think O
strawberries O
are O
to O
blame O
. O
Does O
anyone O
know O
if O
strawberries O
could O
flare B-DIS
you O
up O

I O
can O
relate O
but O
in O
a O
different O
way O
. O
My O
husband O
has O
a O
huge O
sexual O
past O
and O
mine O
is O
pretty O
limited O
. O
Honestly O
, O
his O
past O
turns O
me O
on O
to O
hear O
about O
. O
It O
also O
makes O
me O
jealous O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
ve O
missed O
out O
on O
a O
lot O
because O
he O
s O
not O
that O
way O
with O
me O
. O
I O
know O
it O
s O
just O
because O
he O
s O
maturing O
as O
he O
s O
getting O
older O
, O
but O
I O
want O
those O
experiences O
. O
We O
ve O
had O
3somes O
but O
not O
in O
about O
10 O
years O

you O

the O
I O

you O

I O
need O

you O

I O
truly O
haven O
t O

I O

I O
usually O
just O
put O
in O
an O
absurdly O
long O

that O
I O
know O
lasts O
longer O

it O

take O
me O

then O
kill O
it O
when O
I O
finish O

Get O

possible O

I O
also O
use O

Haha O
it O
is O
funny O
you O
say O
that O
, O
I O
ve O
been O
standing O
. O
I O
just O
keep O
telling O
myself O
If O
Kramer O
can O
do O
it O
... O

Sorry O
im O
going O
to O
edit O
the O

100 O

Thanks O
for O
sharing O
this O
. O
It O
gives O
me O
hope O
I O
ll O
recover O
, O
but O
damn O
if O
6 O
months O
, O
years O
of O
this O
doesn O
t O
make O
me O
terrified O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
doing O
worse O
this O
past O
week O
, O
and O
while O
that O
s O
nothing O
particularly O
new O
I O
have O
good O
and O
bad O
weeks O
, O
says O
, O
I O
m O
very O
scared O
. O
I O
definitely O
have O
orthostatic B-DIS
intolerance I-DIS
, O
because O
standing O
I O
become O
dizzy B-DIS
and O
run B-DIS
out I-DIS
of I-DIS
energy I-DIS
real I-DIS
fast I-DIS
. O
But O
my O
HR O
doesn O
t O
go O
higher O
than O
140 O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
tried O
beta B-DRUG
blockers I-DRUG
yet O
, O
but O
I O
have O
them O
. O
I O
m O
just O
scared O
they O
ll O
make O
me O
more O
exhausted B-DIS
which O
, O
at O
this O
point O
, O
means O
completely O
bedridden O
. O
Right O
now O
, O
I O
spend O
the O
whole O
day O
in O
bed O
but O
I O
get O
up O
and O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
, O
the O
kitchen O
. O
It O
s O
definitely O
better O
if O
I O
stay O
in O
bed O
, O
but O
I O
can O
t O
just O
stay O
in O
bed O
. O
I O
do O
try O
to O
do O
the O
bare O
minimum O
, O
but O
I O
have O
doctors O
appointments O
, O
animals O
to O
care O
for O
and O
while O
my O
mother O
has O
taken O
over O
almost O
all O
the O
housework O
, O
I O
still O
shower O
and O
maintain O
my O
own O
hygiene O
. O
I O
also O
feel O
pressured O
to O
see O
my O
boyfriend O
once O
a O
week O
, O
even O
when O
I O
feel O
positively O
atrocious O
. O
I O
love O
him O
, O
but O
you O
know O
how O
socialization O
takes O
its O
toll O
. O
Do O
you O
also O
have O
terrible B-DIS
pain I-DIS
in I-DIS
your I-DIS
joints I-DIS
and I-DIS
muscles I-DIS
Chronic B-DIS
nausea I-DIS
I O
vomit B-DIS
all O
the O
time O
and O
I O
ve O
tried O
all O
the O
nausea O
meds O
out O
there O
. O
I O
do O
have O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
and O
I O
believe O
it O
got O
a O
lot O
, O
lot O
worse O
because O
of O
whatever O
triggered O
this O
. O

MRI O
with O
contrast O
isn O
t O
always O
conclusive O
. O
There O
are O
lots O
of O
things O
that O
can O
cause O
lesions B-DIS
like O
the O
ones O
they O
call O
MS B-DIS
. O
Sometimes O
the O
spinal O
tap O
will O
come O
back O
with O
no O
results O
, O
true O
. O
This O
happened O
on O
my O
first O
one O
actually O
. O
When O
it O
DOES O
come O
back O
positive O
though O
, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
, O
very O
solid O
positive O
, O
and O
very O
, O
very O
specifically O
for O
MS B-DIS
. O
There O
s O
little O
else O
that O
holds O
the O
same O
certainty O
. O
Of O
course O
all O
the O
other O
tests O
corroborate O
, O
and O
they O
can O
diagnose O
MS B-DIS
even O
without O
the O
spinal O
tap O
. O
I O
d O
have O
one O
anyway O
, O
and O
defo O
get O
a O
second O
opinion O
. O
They O
do O
really O
push O
to O
diagnose O
MS B-DIS
much O
more O
and O
earlier O
these O
days O
, O
and O
that O
means O
putting O
people O
on O
drugs O
with O
debilitating O
side O
effects O
, O
that O
might O
not O
have O
otherwise O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
it O
at O
all O
. O
If O
someone O
only O
has O
very O
minor O
symptoms O
, O
or O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
doubt O
, O
I O
d O
rather O
err O
on O
the O
side O
of O
caution O
. O
In O
that O
case O
I O
d O
really O
want O
the O
spinal O
tap O
to O
come O
back O
positive O
before O
starting O
on O
a O
program O
of O
drugs O
and O
all O
the O
horrors O
that O
can O
bring O
with O
it O
. O

Also O
, O
not O
clear O
if O
my O
hypothyroidism B-DIS
is O
caused O
by O
hashimoto O
s O

I O
made O
a O
rant O
type O
post O
pretty O
much O
about O
this O
today O
. O
I O
took O
metamucil B-DRUG
this O
morning O
and O
ended O
up O
needing O
to O
leave O
work O
. O
So O
glad O
I O
m O
not O
the O
only O
one O

Hi O
, O
I O
m O
in O
the O
hospital O
too O
, O
just O
awaiting O
surgery O
. O
I O
hope O
that O
whatever O
path O
you O
take O
is O
the O
best O
outcome O
for O
you O
Sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
the O
med O
insurance O
issues O
That O
s O
terrible O
and O
no O
person O
should O
have O
to O
suffer O
literally O
physically O
suffer O
terribly O
because O
companies O
and O
others O
can O
t O
get O
their O
shit O
together O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
tip O
regarding O
the O
NG O
tube O
. O
Not O
sure O
if O
I O
ll O
get O
one O
, O
but O
they O
ll O
probably O
place O
it O
while O
I O
m O
asleep O
after O
surgery O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O
Hope O
you O
recuperate O
soon O

LOL O
Oh O
god O
... O
Sorry O
. O
Man O
you O
are O
a O
lucky O
bastard O
. O
I O
came O
here O
looking O
for O
the O
remember O
when O
they O
were O
twice O
as O
big O
and O
literally O
took O
all O
day O
too O
get O
down O
comment O
and O
here O
you O
are O
, O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
your O
journey O
, O
viewing O
that O
long O
path O
before O
you O
going O
... O
Oh O
. O
This O
isn O
t O
easy O
Hugs O
. O

Are O
your O
levels O
optimal O
or O
just O
in O
range O
Not O
all O
doctors O
will O
listen O
to O
you O
. O
Consider O
switching O
brands O
of O
medication O
. O
That O
made O
a O
difference O
for O
me O
. O
Also O
, O
check O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
aren O
t O
deficient B-DIS
in I-DIS
any I-DIS
vitamins I-DIS
or I-DIS
minerals I-DIS
. O
Low B-DIS
D I-DIS
is O
common O
and O
can O
share O
similar O
symptoms O
as O
hypo B-DIS
. O

I O
also O
use O
insulin B-DRUG
needles O
, O
a O
box O
of O
like O
100 O
8mm O
needles O
was O
about O
20 O
with O
insurance O
at O
Costco O
. O
I O
don O
t O
like O
auto O
injectors O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
and O
my O
MTX B-DRUG
comes O
in O
a O
vial O
. O
I O
do O
MTX B-DRUG
and O
Enbrel B-DRUG
shots O
once O
a O
week O
. O
The O
first O
few O
times O
are O
a O
little O
emotional O
, O
and O
that O
s O
okay O
. O
Go O
slow O
with O
the O
plunger O
until O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
, O
and O
then O
it O
really O
does O
become O
routine O
. O
I O
usually O
give O
myself O
5 O
minutes O
alone O
in O
a O
quiet O
part O
of O
the O
house O
typically O
the O
bathroom O
to O
do O
my O
shots O
, O
typically O
on O
a O
Friday O
evening O
. O
I O
originally O
planned O
this O
so O
that O
A O
I O
could O
sleep O
through O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
potential O
side O
effects O
, O
and O
B O
if O
you O
re O
the O
type O
to O
get O
a O
MTX B-DRUG
hangover O
, O
Saturday O
s O
are O
typically O
less O
taxing O
than O
weekdays O
. O
I O
second O
the O
other O
advice O
in O
letting O
it O
warm O
up O
. O
What O
I O
ll O
usually O
do O
with O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
is O
keep O
it O
in O
the O
fridge O
, O
and O
then O
when O
I O
get O
home O
from O
classes O
work O
on O
Friday O
I O
set O
up O
the O
syringe O
and O
leave O
it O
out O
to O
warm O
up O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
until O
it O
gets O
to O
room O
temperature O
. O
Doing O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
injections O
with O
a O
small O
insulin B-DRUG
needle O
is O
probably O
the O
biggest O
difference O
you O
can O
make O
in O
making O
the O
injections O
suck O
less O
. O
My O
Enbrel B-DRUG
comes O
in O
an O
inch O
long O
needle O
which O
I O
think O
is O
27mm O
, O
so O
what O
you O
have O
, O
and O
that O
hurts O
but O
only O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
during O
and O
maybe O
a O
minute O
or O
two O
after O
. O

Hey O
man O
I O
m O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
, O
it O
s O
a O
really O
shitty O
feeling O
, O
cause O
you O
re O
given O
this O
bit O
of O
hope O
and O
then O
summer O
comes O
along O
and O
it O
hits O
you O
. O

This O
attitude O
is O
ridiculous O
. O
Crohn O
s O
is O
only O
part O
of O
my O
life O
and O
I O
don O
t O
need O
to O
run O
around O
telling O
everyone O
I O
know O
. O
I O
talk O
about O
it O
when O
it O
s O
relevant O
. O
Otherwise O
you O
re O
just O
annoying O
people O
or O
making O
them O
uncomfortable O
always O
pronouncing O
about O
your O
illness O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
people O
have O
something O
going O
on O
, O
not O
just O
us O
... O

My O
tinnitus B-DIS
pitch O
is O
6khz O
and O
I O
have O
Meniere O
s. O
Low O
frequency O
might O
be O
an O
indicator O
, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
necessarily O
the O
case O
... O

My O
first O
therapist O
never O
ever O
told O
me O
. O
She O
never O
mentioned O
BPD B-DIS
or O
any O
diagnosis O
at O
all O
. O
But O
she O
wrote O
it O
in O
her O
report O
to O
my O
second O
therapist O
, O
which O
my O
second O
therapist O
let O
me O
read O
. O
Then O
my O
new O
therapist O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
giving O
me O
materials O
to O
read O
and O
explaining O
things O
. O

her O
young O
age O
any O
chance O
at O
disability O
is O
a O
long O
way O
away O
, O
had O
to O
have O
a O
lawyer O
to O
appeal O
for O
a O
court O
case O
due O
to O
several O
rejections O
for O
disability O
, O
they O
don O
t O
expect O
to O
actually O
see O
her O
until O
early O
next O
year O
. O
So O
please O
any O
info O
at O
all O
you O
could O
share O
could O
make O
a O
life O
altering O
difference O
for O
her O
. O

I O
used O
at-gel B-DRUG
just O
about O
an O
hour O
ago O
, O
and O
it O
s O
been O
reduced O
a O
lot O
. O
It O
it O
helps O
, O
before O
, O
I O
used O
an O
anti-dandruff B-DRUG
shampoo I-DRUG
, O
which O
I O
found O
out O
it O
was O
harmful O
to O
psoriasis B-DIS
. O
Maybe O
I O
will O
try O
Clobex B-DRUG
, O
but O
for O
now O
I O
ll O
try O
T-gel B-DRUG
for O
2 O
3 O
times O
a O
week O
. O
But O
the O
other O
days O
, O
ordinary B-DRUG
shampoo I-DRUG
will O
be O
okay O

I O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
been O
helped O
by O
redditors O
before O
with O
my O
supplies O
. O
I O
m O
happy O
to O
pass O
that O
forward O
. O
While O
it O
would O
be O
super O
disappointing O
for O
someone O
to O
lie O
about O
needing O
free O
supplies O
, O
I O
m O
ok O
taking O
that O
chance O
. O
Plus O
, O
I O
can O
stalk O
people O
s O
post O
history O
to O
see O
if O
their O
need O
seems O
legit O

I O
like O
to O
build O
mostly O
electrical O
stuff O
, O
I O
can O
get O
my O
mind O
off O
of O
other O
things O
and O
sometimes O
I O
even O
end O
up O
with O
something O
useful O
I O
just O
finished O
repairing O
, O
painting O
and O
tuning O
an O
old O
Amiga O
500 O
and O
now O
got O
my O
hands O
on O
all O
the O
parts O
I O
need O
to O
build O
a O
Gameboy O
mod O
with O
a O
Raspberry O
Pi O
inside O
. O
I O
frequent O
our O
pharmacy O
- O
but O
they O
still O
asked O
about O
a O
hundred O
times O
why O
I O
would O
really O
need O
the O
highest O
H2O2 O
concentration O
they O
can O
mix O
up O
, O
even O
had O
to O
sign O
a O
document O
to O
get O
it O
... O
My O
issues O
are O
mostly O
in O
my O
legs O
and O
eye B-DIS
sight I-DIS
short O
distance O
is O
OK O
though O
mostly O
, O
so O
if O
I O
have O
a O
bad O
day O
I O
can O
just O
sit O
down O
and O
tinker O
a O
bit O

I O
ve O
often O
taken O
mine O
with O
a O
light O
shake O
almond O
milk O
and O
a O
banana O
blended O
sure O
you O
could O
get O
by O
on O
something O
similar O
if O
not O
just O
milk O

It O
s O
always O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
see O
a O
urologist O
and O
get O
a O
CT O
scan O
. O
If O
a O
stone B-DIS
is O
blocking O
one O
of O
your O
kidneys O
, O
it O
can O
lead O
to O
hydronephrosis B-DIS
, O
which O
is O
bad O
for O
your O
kidney O
. O
He O
ll O
also O
put O
you O
on O
antibiotics B-DRUG
. O
You O
definitely O
don O
t O
want O
to O
leave O
a O
urinary B-DIS
tract I-DIS
infection I-DIS
untreated O
. O
Read O
this O

psoriasin B-DRUG
ointment I-DRUG
is O
my O
go-to O
. O
it O
doesn O
t O
have O
much O
smell O
, O
and O
doesnt O
make O
a O
big O
mess O
. O
i O
also O
use O
a O
vaseline-brand O
problem O
skin O
therapy O
cream O
sometimes O
. O
it O
was O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
helped O
back O
when O
i O
didnt O
know O
i O
had O
the O
P. O
edit O
psoriasin B-DRUG
makes O
a O
gel O
too O
thats O
not O
as O
thick O
but O
i O
dont O
use O
it O
because O
it O
burns B-DIS
when O
i O
have O
cracked B-DIS
skin I-DIS
, O
and O
my O
worst O
area O
is O
the O
groin O
, O
so O
... O
ow O
. O
the O
ointment O
has O
no O
burning O
. O
also O
, O
i O
use O
sebcur-t B-DRUG
shampoo I-DRUG
sometimes O
. O
there O
s O
a O
non-coal B-DRUG
psoriasis I-DRUG
shampoo I-DRUG
that O
i O
tried O
recently O
, O
worked O
ok O
, O
but O
i O
dont O
remember O
the O
name O
of O
it O

The O
process O
failed O
me O
hard O
on O
the O
patient O
education O
piece O
and O
the O
followup O
was O
horrible O
. O
I O
started O
using O
sleepyhead B-DRUG
and O
went O
back O
through O
my O
Numbers O
... O
My O
doctor O
pushed O
for O
surgery O
and O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
why O
, O
he O
would O
not O
tell O
me O
what O
his O
expectations O
were O
. O
He O
would O
not O
give O
me O
any O
expectations O
. O
He O
never O
mentioned O
mask O
or O
what O
its O
importance O
was O
. O
I O
doubt O
he O
knew O
what O
machine O
I O
had O
Why O
I O
didn O
t O
figure O
it O
out O
sooner O
is O
a O
long O
story O
, O
but O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
its O
disgusting O
that O
I O
ve O
had O
to O
teach O
myself O
, O
through O
trial O
and O
error O
and O
a O
few O
idiotic O
mistakes O
. O
For O
months O
I O
just O
thought O
this O
is O
how O
it O
is O
**TLDR** O
a O
year O
wasted O
because O
I O
did O
not O
know O
something O
was O
horribly O
wrong O
. O

I O
guess O
that O
s O
the O
magic O
age O
Biologics O
effect O
my O
immune O
system O
too O
much O
. O
They O
are O
what O
cause O
me O
to O
catch O
shingles B-DIS
at O
age O
25 O
. O
It O
s O
a O
vicious O
cycle O
, O
I O
ve O
opted O
to O
avoid O
biologics B-DRUG
for O
now O
. O

Well O
sharing O
my O
mums O
genes O
is O
indeed O
a O
risk O
factor O
since O
diabetes B-DIS
has O
been O
around O
in O
her O
family O
for O
a O
while O
. O
But O
in O
fact O
I O
do O
plan O
to O
work O
out O
, O
else O
I O
don O
t O
see O
a O
sense O
in O
consuming O
more O
calories O
protein O
hehe O
. O
Thanks O
for O
your O
input O
. O

lol O
. O
me O
too O
a O
fucking O
doctor O
. O
I O
have O
UC B-DIS
40 O
years O
and O
also O
not O
a O
GI O
m.d O
. O
And O
sure O
some O
stress B-DIS
can O
complicate O
many O
most O
illnesses O
. O
Like O
cardiac B-DIS
disease I-DIS
MIs B-DIS
etc O
. O

I O
was O
taking O
it O
before O
bed O
too O
but O
I O
stopped O
because O
it O
was O
altering B-DIS
my I-DIS
period I-DIS
, O
making B-DIS
my I-DIS
face I-DIS
break I-DIS
out I-DIS
in I-DIS
pimples I-DIS
, O
and O
causing B-DIS
hair I-DIS
loss I-DIS
. O
Something O
you O
might O
try O
is O
iberogas B-DRUG
, O
it O
s O
super O
bitter O
and O
taste O
horrid O
but O
it O
can O
trigger O
your O
stomach O
to O
empty O
even O
after O
you O
ve O
had O
food O
. O
It O
s O
all O
natural O
herbs O
and O
I O
m O
at O
the O
point O
where O
I O
know O
it O
ll O
help O
so O
I O
take O
it O
without O
getting O
grossed O
out O
. O
I O
think O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
problem O
is O
that O
even O
when O
there O
s O
no O
food O
in O
my O
stomach O
, O
my O
stomach O
is O
producing O
acid O
while O
I O
sleep O
which O
is O
causing O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
which O
causes O
me O
to O
be O
nauseated B-DIS
. O
My O
doctor O
recommended O
elevating O
the O
headboard O
by O
4-6 O
inches O
. O
I O
tried O
that O
but O
honestly O
, O
if O
there O
was O
a O
way O
for O
me O
to O
sleep O
while O
standing O
that O
would O
probably O
fix O
my O
sleeping O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
issues O
lol O
Hope O
this O
helps O

you O
re O
not O
alone O
, O
and O
i O
m O
sorry O
that O
this O
has O
happened O
to O
you O
, O
friend O

I O
ve O
contacted O
a O
suicide B-DIS
prevention O
line O
but O
I O
feel O
like O
nothing O
they O
can O
say O
or O
do O
can O
help O
me O
. O
I O
m O
really O
struggling O
and O
I O
had O
prexisting O
depression B-DIS
ptsd B-DIS
anxiety B-DIS
prior O
to O
getting O
sick O
. O
Now O
this O
diagnosis O
has O
put O
me O
over O
the O
edge O
and O
I O
m O
kind O
of O
fighting O
the O
urge O
to O
jump O
out O
a O
window O

Who O
would O
downvote O
this O

been O
through O
many O
tests O
. O
It O
s O
just O
finally O
good O
to O
know O
what O
s O
been O
going O
on O
and O
how O
all O
the O
different O
things O
tie O
together O
so O
that O
I O
can O
finally O
be O
to O
where O
I O
can O
research O
. O
Taking O
the O
magnesium O
has O
made O
a O
great O
massive O
difference O
. O
I O
m O
carrying O
through O
w O
the O
direction O
of O
the O
doc O
w O
regards O
to O
the O
low O
magnesium O
since O
the O
symptoms O
from O
the O
low O
magnesium O
had O
caused O
such O
dangerous O
situations O
. O
I O
personally O
don O
t O
recommend O
use O
of O
high O
doses O
of O
magnesium O
w O
o O
the O
direction O
of O
a O
doc O
and O
regular O
labs O
since O
high O
mag O
can O
cause O
same O
symptoms O
as O
low O
mag O
can O
. O
..communication O
between O
brain O
and O
head O

Lol O
that O
one O
made O
me O
laugh O
. O
Yep O
W O
all O
I O
ve O
been O
through O

I O
just O
think O
what O

Lol O
I O
m O
sure O
many O
can O
relate O
to O
that O

EDITED O

more O

Hang O
in O
there O
- O
you O
may O
have O
a O
complicated O
case O
but O
what O
you O
have O
going O
for O
you O
is O
your O
intuition O
that O
you O
still O
have O
not O
found O
the O
answers O
you O
need O
. O
It O
sounds O
like O
the O
Dr O
s O
you O
have O
tried O
before O
just O
don O
t O
know O
how O
to O
handle O
your O
symptoms O
and O
may O
pinhole O
them O
as O
other O
things O
. O
Everything O
in O
your O
body O
is O
connected O
. O
Your O
gut B-DIS
is I-DIS
troubled I-DIS
from O
what O
it O
sounds O
like O
so O
your O
food O
isn O
t O
getting O
absorbed O
the O
correct O
way O
- O
then O
that O
is O
a O
domino O
effect O
in O
your O
body O
for O
other O
ailments O
from O
what O
I O
ve O
been O
told O
Maybe O
look O
into O
healing O
your O
gut O
with O
supplementation O
diet O
and O
stress O
management O
I O
know O
, O
really O
really O
difficult O
I O
feel O
like O
a O
holistic O
approach O
is O
the O
best O
way O
but O
you O
are O
also O
talking O
to O
someone O
who O
only O
goes O
to O
a O
chiro O
naturopath O
for O
my O
hashis B-DIS
. O
I O
have O
successfully O
lowered O
my O
Thyroid B-DIS
Globulin I-DIS
Antibodies I-DIS
naturally O
off O
of O
synthroid B-DRUG
Anyway O
, O
answers O
and O
education O
is O
power O
. O
You O
might O
have O
other O
things O
you O
haven O
t O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
yet O
. O
Keep O
searching O
- O
go O
into O
this O
new O
dr O
insurance O
with O
a O
fresh O
perspective O
you O
ve O
been O
dismissed O
in O
the O
past O
but O
don O
t O
let O
it O
happen O
again O
. O
You O
deserve O
to O
know O
what O
is O
going O
on O
in O
your O
body O
to O
help O
change O
it O
. O
Good O

D O

I O
ve O
had O
Raynaud O
s O
since O
2006 O
, O
diagnosed O
with O
T1D B-DIS
in O
2009 O
. O
There O
is O
evidence O
that O
Raynaud O
s O
is O
an O
autoimmune B-DIS
disease I-DIS
although O
there O
are O
other O
causes O
as O
well O
. O
There O
have O
been O
studies O
that O
suggest O
that O
individuals O
who O
have O
one O
autoimmune O
disease O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
get O
additional O
ones O
. O
So O
, O
do O
you O
have O
Raynaud O
s O
Maybe O
. O
It O
s O
not O
an O
absurd O
guess O
since O
you O
already O
have O
an O
autoimmue O
disorder O
. O
But O
go O
check O
with O
a O
doctor O
- O
. O
If O
you O
do O
, O
or O
even O
if O
you O
don O
t O
invest O
in O
some O
expensive O
, O
good O
quality O
wool O
socks O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
wear O
fingerless O
gloves O
when O
typing O
on O
my O
computer O
to O
keep O
my O
hands O
warm O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
there O
. O
I O
also O
have O
Essential B-DIS
Tremors I-DIS
, O
so O
when O
I O
got O
the O
DatScan O
results O
saying O
that O
I O
had O
both O
, O
I O
was O
crushed O
. O
I O
cried O
for O
2 O
months O
solid O
. O
It O
was O
pretty O
bleak O
. O
I O
ordered O
Parkinson O
s O
Disease O
for O
Dummies O
, O
and O
although O
it O
answered O
my O
questions O
, O
the O
outlook O
was O
still O
grim O
. O
I O
had O
a O
why O
bother O
Attitude O
about O
everything O
. O
Nothing O
had O
meaning O
anymore O
. O
Finish O
my O
degree O
For O
what O
Take O
my O
meds O
Why O
I O
m O
still O
sick O
. O
I O
m O
going O
to O
suffer O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
. O
Then O
, O
I O
remembered O
a O
segment O
on O
CBS O
Sunday O
morning O
about O
Rock O
Steady O
Boxing O
. O
I O
forced O
myself O
to O
go O
. O
Gym O
, O
shower O
, O
bed O
. O
That O
was O
my O
life O
. O
Nothing O
else O
for O
at O
least O
2 O
months O
. O
Slowly O
more O
life O
creeped O
in O
. O
Lunches O
with O
friends O
. O
Movies O
by O
myself O
. O
Support O
group O
meetings O
. O
It O
s O
been O
6 O
months O
now O
. O
I O
m O
still O
terrified O
of O
what O
s O
going O
to O
happen O
. O
But O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
can O
have O
a O
few O
good O
, O
almost O
symptom O
free O
days O
. O
I O
have O
to O
appreciate O
the O
now O
, O
and O
not O
obsess O
with O
what O
may O
probably O
will O
happen O
to O
me O
in O
the O
future O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
through O
a O
move O
while O
doing O
a O
divorce O
. O
My O
best O
advice O
is O
twofold O
be O
as O
kind O
as O
you O
can O
to O
your O
SO O
to O
prevent O
divorce O
and O
even O
openly O
talk O
about O
it O
with O
them O
. O
Give O
them O
the O
option O
if O
you O
feel O
they O
want O
out O
. O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
move O
just O
break O
it O
down O
into O
manageable O
pieces O
with O
lots O
of O
lists O
and O
breaks O
. O
Good O
luck O

My O
father O
in O
law O
is O
in O
a O
memory O
care O
facility O
in O
California O
. O
He O
has O
recently O
become O
incontinent B-DIS
and O
has O
been O
non B-DIS
compliant I-DIS
in O
related O
areas O
at O
night O
. O
He O
will O
not O
change O
his O
clothes O
or O
try O
to O
pee O
at O
night O
, O
he O
is O
resistant B-DIS
if O
the O
staff O
find O
him O
wet O
at O
night O
and O
want O
to O
change O
his O
clothes O
, O
he O
is O
very O
angry B-DIS
when O
they O
check O
on O
him O
at O
night O
. O
Any O
experience O
or O
thoughts O
about O
this O
, O
I O
m O
assuming O
, O
pretty O
common O
scenario O
The O
staff O
is O
very O
nice O
and O
I O
know O
they O
try O
but O
they O
seem O
to O
be O
pretty O
ineffective O
at O
gaining O
compliance O
and O
seem O
to O
think O
he O
is O
unusually O
non O
complaint O
, O
which O
I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
believing O
. O

I O
ve O
posted O
the O
story O
on O
all O
local O
news O
outlets O
social O
media O
, O
but O
I O
will O
call O
on O
Monday O
if O
I O
do O
not O
get O
a O
resolution O
from O
the O
actual O
Cracker O
Barrel O
. O
My O
boss O
just O
called O
the O
store O
after O
she O
read O
all O
of O
this O
on O
Facebook O
she O
s O
great O
. O
The O
manager O
was O
incredibly O
rude O
to O
her O
and O
said O
my O
grandfather O
had O
been O
sexually O
harassing O
his O
staff O
Seriously O
This O
is O
the O
first O
I O
ve O
heard O
of O
it O
and O
would O
not O
be O
allowed O
in O
anymore O
. O
She O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
understood O
dementia B-DIS
, O
but O
she O
says O
it O
sounds O
like O
he O
felt O
the O
actions O
were O
intentional O
. O
He O
eventually O
said O
he O
got O
that O
he O
had O
dementia B-DIS
, O
but O
then O
apparently O
got O
defensive O
when O
she O
said O
he O
was O
discriminating O
for O
a O
disability O
. O
I O
m O
so O
sorry O
if O
he O
was O
sexually O
harassing O
anyone O
, O
but O
we O
thought O
we O
had O
it O
cleared O
up O
and O
promised O
to O
only O
allow O
him O
to O
visit O
with O
someone O
else O
there O
He O
honestly O
doesn O
t O
know O
what O
s O
going O
on O
half O
the O
time O
anymore O
I O
will O
probably O
also O
file O
a O
state O
complaint O
with O
the O
Civil O
Rights O
Center O
. O

I O
have O
mitral B-DIS
valve I-DIS
prolapse I-DIS
, O
but O
that O
s O
really O
common O
. O
I O
*think* O
I O
get O
occasional O
mitral B-DIS
valve I-DIS
regurgitations I-DIS
, O
but O
they O
re O
so O
rare O
I O
can O
only O
go O
by O
other O
people O
s O
descriptions O
of O
how O
it O
feels O
. O
Anyway O
, O
that O
s O
not O
much O
concern O
- O
it O
s O
really O
common O
. O
Otherwise O
just O
tachycardia B-DIS
. O
IST B-DIS
is O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
exclusion O
, O
so O
basically O
, O
they O
have O
to O
check O
you O
for O
every O
possible O
thing O
that O
could O
cause O
tachycardia B-DIS
before O
settling O
on O
IST B-DIS
. O
So O
, O
we O
did O
stress O
tests O
, O
echocardiograms O
, O
24hr O
holter O
monitors O
, O
etc O
. O
I O
have O
a O
normal O
rhythm O
, O
it O
s O
just O
fast O
. O
My O
palpitations B-DIS
don O
t O
show O
up O
on O
EKG O
or O
anything O
. O
Everything O
is O
fine O
, O
my O
heart O
just O
goes O
too O
fast O
, O
which O
is O
exhausting O
and O
uncomfortable O
. O
I O
recently O
started O
checking O
my O
BP O
regularly O
and O
have O
found O
it O
s O
generally O
low O
no O
surprise O
there O
. O
Over O
the O
past O
few O
days O
it O
s O
usually O
in O
the O
90 O
s O
60 O
s O
range O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
a O
few O
readings O
with O
diastolic O
in O
the O
50s O
. O
My O
heart O
rate O
is O
usually O
in O
the O
80s-90s O
, O
but O
if O
I O
m O
up O
and O
moving O
, O
it O
can O
be O
in O
the O
120s O
. O
Getting O
ready O
in O
the O
mornings O
or O
doing O
anything O
strenuous O
which O
would O
probably O
include O
taking O
the O
stairs O
, O
but O
I O
avoid O
stairs O
like O
the O
plague O
... O
it O
jumps O
into O
the O
150s O
. O
It O
also O
doesn O
t O
really O
settle O
down O
well O
once O
I O
m O
sitting O
. O
I O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
recover O
, O
it O
seems O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
dysautonomia B-DIS
yet O
, O
but O
with O
the O
IST B-DIS
and O
possible O
contributory O
POTS B-DIS
, O
plus O
all O
the O
typical B-DIS
autonomic I-DIS
issues I-DIS
, O
I O
m O
fairly O
certain O
this O
is O
all O
connected O
. O
Also O
, O

When O
my O
stones B-DIS
were O
stuck O
, O
it O
felt O
a O
lot O
like O
gas B-DIS
. O
I O
took O
Pepcid B-DRUG
, O
Nexium B-DRUG
, O
Tums B-DRUG
, O
you O
name O
it O
. O
I O
hope O
that O
s O
not O
what O
it O
is O
. O
Good O
luck O
and O
keep O
us O
updated O

I O
was O
thinking O
this O
exactly O
lately O
, O
thougts O
like O
damn O
must O
feels O
nice O
being O
drunk O
all O
the O
time O
or O
maybe O
weed O
will O
make O
me O
discover O
a O
more O
peacefull O
mind O
have O
crossed O
my O
mind O
quite O
often O

And O
you O
thought O
4 O
weeks O
was O
delayed O
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
support O
. O
I O
saw O
some O
improvement O
with O
my O
gut O
, O
but O
in O
my O
last O
of O
the O
4 O
weeks O
of O
my O
anti-SIBO B-DRUG
diet I-DRUG
came O
down O
with O
a O
really O
, O
really O
nasty B-DIS
infection I-DIS
that O
required O
2 O
weeks O
of O
antibiotics B-DRUG
. O
And O
then O
final O
exams O
. O
And O
then O
changed O
jobs O
. O
And O
then O
my O
boyfriend O
moved O
in O
with O
me O
. O
Needless O
to O
say O
, O
I O
m O
almost O
back O
at O
square O
one O
in O
terms O
of O
diet O
and O
health O
because O
I O
just O
didn O
t O
have O
the O
time O
for O
almost O
2 O
months O
, O
I O
m O
just O
hoping O
I O
actually O
managed O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
my O
SIBO B-DIS
and O
that O
it O
s O
an O
easier O
fix O
this O
time O
. O
I O
went O
back O
to O
see O
my O
naturopath O
before O
I O
went O
on O
antibiotics O
, O
and O
she O
clarified O
that O
I O
didn O
t O
need O
to O
worry O
so O
much O
about O
dextrose O
and O
stuff O
in O
foods O
, O
but O
to O
stick O
to O
a O
general O
if O
it O
tastes O
sweet O
, O
don O
t O
eat O
it O
policy O
, O
and O
the O
plan O
was O
to O
slowly O
introduce O
foods O
back O
into O
my O
diet O
and O
she O
would O
help O
me O
balance O
the O
sugars O
in O
foods O
so O
that O
I O
could O
eat O
them O
again O
. O
It O
feels O
kind O
of O
pointless O
to O
go O
back O
now O
after O
having O
undone O
all O
the O
work O
we O
did O
so O
I O
want O
to O
get O
back O
on O
track O
for O
a O
month O
before O
seeing O
her O
again O
, O
I O
just O
don O
t O
know O
what O
I O
m O
going O
to O
do O
about O
my O
diet O
. O
I O
might O
just O
do O
Whole O
30 O
it O
s O
the O
closest O
to O
what O
she O
has O
me O
on O
minus O
whatever O
I O
know O
I O
can O
t O
digest O
. O
I O
dunno O
. O

Agree O
100 O
Death O
is O
way O
down O
on O
my O
list O
of O
shit O
to O
be O
afraid O
of O
. O
For O
nearly O
3 O
years O
I O
ve O
been O
dealing O
with O
the O
DLB B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
and O
every O
day O
scares O
me O
. O

Thank O
you O
I O
will O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
joining O
an O
exercise O
group O
or O
doing O
something O
a O
little O
more O
social O

have O
done O
that O
as O
well O
to O
no O
avail O
but O
i O
appreciate O
the O
suggestion O
i O
have O
an O
incredible O
GI O
doctor O
who O
does O
abdominal O
ultrasounds O
LFT O
pretty O
regularly O
since O
i O
lost B-DIS
my I-DIS
gallbladder I-DIS
a O
little O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
but O
i O
appreciate O
the O
suggestion O
. O
i O
did O
starch O
based O
as O
well O
but O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
worse O
probably O
bc O
i O
was O
unintentionally O
low O
carb O
for O
so O
long O
aka O
paleo O
and O
my O
body O
doesn O
t O
like O
it O
so O
i O
m O
slowly O
upping O
my O
carbs O
but O
not O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
at O
all O
tbh O
it O
all O
kind O
of O
makes O
me O
feel O
like O
... O
what O
if O
my O
root O
cause O
is O
just O
... O
bad O
genetics O
... O
like O
... O
i O
have O
taken O
really O
good O
care O
of O
myself O
w O
nutrition O
and O
exercise O
from O
a O
young O
age O
yet O
... O
i O
still O
became O
ill O
... O
my O
dad O
rides O
100 O
miles O
a O
week O
on O
a O
bike O
and O
still O
got O
terminal B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
last O
year O
... O
almost O
like O
its O
somehow O
... O
out O
of O
our O
control O

Are O
you O
currently O
on O
any O
medications O

May O
be O
a O
stupid O
question O
but O
how O
does O
your O
back O
feel O
Do O
you O
get O
pins B-DIS
and I-DIS
needles I-DIS
in I-DIS
your I-DIS
feet I-DIS
and O
is O
one O
foot O
worse O

This O
time O
my O
culture O
came O
back O
positive O
. O
I O
had O
a O
staph B-DIS
bacteria I-DIS
that O
didn O
t O
make O
nitrites O
, O
so O
the O
nitrite O
section O
was O
useless O
. O
I O
keep O
sample O
cups O
at O
my O
home O
and O
just O
drop O
them O
off O
at O
my O
Dr O
s O
office O
for O
a O
culture O
to O
save O
time O
. O
You O
can O
get O
them O
from O
Amazon O
. O

It O
s O
always O
good O
to O
spread O
positivity O

Having O
a O
long O
history O
of O
UTI O
symptoms O
with O
no O
bacteria O
, O
coupled O
with O
an O
especially O
bad B-DIS
food I-DIS
trigger I-DIS
got O
me O
diagnosed O
. O
I O
ate O
a O
spicy O
chicken O
and O
pineapple O
dish O
and O
found O
myself O
in O
a O
new O
doctor O
s O
office O
new O
to O
me O
anyway O
, O
my O
regular O
was O
out O
that O
day O
and O
she O
looked O
at O
my O
history O
, O
I O
told O
her O
this O
happens O
every O
time O
I O
eat O
something O
spicy O
or O
acidic O
, O
I O
had O
some O
other O
tests O
done O
to O
rule O
out O
other O
possibilities O
pelvic O
exam O
, O
STI O
tests O
and O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
IC B-DIS
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
asking O
for O
a O
ureaplasma B-DIS
test O
, O
because O
I O
ve O
read O
on O
numerous O
sites O
that O
the O
symptoms O
of O
a O
ureaplasma B-DIS
infection I-DIS
are O
so O
similar O
to O
IC O
that O
they O
re O
nearly O
indistinguishable O
from O
one O
another O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O

Thanks O
for O
your O
story O
. O
I O
was O
just O
diagnosed O
and O
I O
m O
kinda O
freaking O
out O
about O
it O
... O
I O
appreciate O
your O
positive O
outlook O

Pallidotomy O
and O
Thalamotomy O
are O
two O
types O
of O
ablative O
brain O
surgery O
. O
Historically O
this O
was O
either O
a O
scalpel O
1930 O
s O
or O
using O
an O
electronic O
scalpel O
heated O
element O
to O
perform O
the O
cut O
in O
the O
brain O
to O
help O
with O
movement B-DIS
disorders I-DIS
. O
You O
need O
to O
cut O
a O
hole O
into O
the O
skull O
, O
then O
insert O
the O
scalpel O
to O
perform O
the O
cuts O
. O
The O
focused O
ultrasonic O
is O
still O
ablative O
brain O
surgery O
, O
but O
can O
be O
done O
without O
having O
to O
cut O
a O
hole O
into O
the O
skull O
. O
No O
chance O
of O
infection B-DIS
, O
but O
remember O
once O
the O
cut O
is O
done O
there O
is O
no O
recourse O
. O
So O
there O
isn O
t O
any O
chance O
of O
changing O
the O
outcome O
. O
DBS O
deep O
brain O
stimulation O
does O
allow O
for O
electrodes O
to O
be O
removed O
in O
the O
future O
. O
So O
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
of O
reversal O
if O
not O
successful O
. O
Admitted O
higher O
chance O
of O
infection O
, O
and O
also O
complications O
. O
Focused O
Ultra O
Sound O
cost O
about O
6000 O
for O
the O
surgery O
. O
DBS O
Deep O
Brain O
Surgery O
is O
about O
125,000 O
168,000 O
for O
the O
surgery O
. O
I O
suspect O
we O
will O
see O
insurance O
companies O
pushing O
us O
towards O
Focus O
Ultra O
Sound O
due O
to O
cost O
savings O
. O
So O
do O
your O
research O
before O
committing O
to O
surgery O
. O
Cool O
XRAY O
Showing O
the O
leads O
that O
are O
in O
the O
brain O
a O
friend O
didn O
t O
realize O
how O
deep O
they O
are O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
slight O
thalamotomy O
when O
inserting O
the O
leads O
. O

Only O
open O
to O
Americans O

weird O
, O
but O
I O
m O
glad O
you O
don O
t O
have O
to O
be O
weighed O
down O
by O
it O
a O
bad O

Whether O
or O
not O
it O
s O
a O
waste O
for O
you O
, O
you O
were O
giving O
advice O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
new O
to O
managing O
their O
and O
has O
no O
baseline O
. O
So O
telling O
them O
to O
do O
more O
useless O
testing O
and O
not O
even O
mentioning O
testing O
post O
meals O
is O
pretty O
poor O
advice O
. O

Untreated O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
is O
a O
lot O
worse O
than O
most O
people O
think O
, O
and O
people O
need O
to O
understand O
that O
its O
effects O
can O
be O
devastating O
. O
However O
, O
it O
s O
not O
untreatable O
and O
not O
incurable O
, O
so O
in O
general O
I O
don O
t O
think O
it O
s O
fair O
to O
say O
that O
it O
s O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
diseases O
out O
there O
. O

Which O
one O
did O
you O
use O

I O
ve O
been O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
twice O
and O
never O
had O
any O
bad O
reaction O
at O
all O
. O
Good O
luck O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
. O
I O
agree O
, O
it O
can O
still O
feel O
pretty O
isolating B-DIS
. O
I O
know O
I O
m O
not O
the O
only O
person O
to O
ever O
go O
through O
this O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
I O
am O
sometimes O
. O
It O
feels O
good O
to O
get O
this O
off O
my O
chest O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
feel O
a O
bit O
of O
relief O
as O
well O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
the O
absolute O
best O
, O
and O
I O
m O
sure O
your O
mom O
would O
as O
well O
. O

Yeah O
me O
too O
, O
my O
GPA B-DIS
is O
kind O
of O
fucked O
rn O
from O
being O
sick O
for O
2 O
years O
and O
trying O
to O
take O
full O
class O
loads O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
hospitalized O
11 O
times O
, O
but O
feel O
much O
better O
now O
than O
I O
ever O
have O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
should O
take O
it O
easy O
with O
my O
condition O
and O
all O

Hmm O
that O
s O
interesting O
. O
I O
will O
see O
if O
I O
can O
find O
a O
jaw O
surgeon O
. O
The O
reason O
my O
dentist O
suggested O
Invisalign B-DRUG
is O
because O
my O
bite O
is O
off O
which O
is O
causing O
my O
teeth O
to O
grind O
over O
time O
. O
Thank O
you O

Thanks O
so O
much O
for O
the O
insight O
. O
Unsalted O
nuts O
and O
cut O
up O
veggies O
with O
dip O
are O
awesome O

it O

I O
write O
my O

blog O
for O
my O
80yo O
self O
, O
to O
remind O
me O
when O
the O
memories B-DIS
fade I-DIS

I O
m O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
others O
read O
it O
. O
I O
wrote O
the O
T2 O

as O
an O

I O
found O
I O
was O
too O
often O
repeating B-DIS
myself I-DIS

CPAP B-DRUG

It O
is O
a O
bit O
atypical O
to O
have O
the O
vertigo B-DIS
symptoms O
worsen O
after O
ten O
years O
, O
mostly O
Meniere B-DIS
sufferers O
have O
their O
worst O
bouts O
of O
dizziness B-DIS
in O
the O
first O
months O
after O
the O
onset O
. O
This O
is O
not O
worrying O
in O
itself O
, O
you O
can O
just O
have O
some O
atypical O
symptoms O
or O
another O
cause O
can O
be O
in O
play O
. O
Anyway O
, O
visiting O
a O
ENT O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
. O
Unfortunately O
it O
took O
me O
over O
25 O
years O
to O
get O
the O
right O
diagnosis O
always O
being O
told O
I O
had O
Menieres O
, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
Ramsay B-DIS
Hunt I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
- O
not O
that O
it O
makes O
much O
difference O
for O
everyday O
life O
. O
My O
point O
being O
, O
there O
is O
not O
much O
in O
the O
doctor O
s O
toolbox O
to O
fix O
dizziness B-DIS
, O
but O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
. O

I O
m O
a O
T1 B-DIS
for O
26 O
years O
now O
, O
and O
this O
shit O
still O
happens O
to O
me O
. O
Don O
t O
beat O
yourself O
up O
over O
it O

TNF B-DRUG

My O
father-in-law O
doesn O
t O
have O
significant O
health O
concerns O
, O
although O
we O
found O
that O
he O
gets O
forgetful B-DIS
sometimes O
but O
we O
thought O
it O
is O
natural O
. O
This O
is O
aging O
, O
we O
told O
ourselves O
. O
In O
order O
to O
strengthen O
the O
security O
of O
the O
home O
, O
we O
have O
installed O
a O
free O
security O
camera O
app O
called O
Alfred O
on O
old O
phones O
. O
I O
tape O
one O
phone O
on O
the O
front O
door O
glass O
. O
The O
rear O
camera O
watches O
over O
our O
front O
porch O
and O
the O
front O
camera O
watches O
the O
hallway O
. O
The O
camera O
keeps O
a O
video O
journal O
of O
when O
the O
mailman O
came O
and O
when O
my O
father-in-law O
left O
home O
for O
a O
walk O
. O
That O
day O
, O
I O
left O
home O
to O
pick O
up O
my O
kids O
from O
school O
. O
The O
ride O
was O
only O
10 O
minutes O
. O
When O
we O
arrived O
home O
, O
we O
smelt O
something O
unpleasant O
and O
disturbing O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
see O
anything O
suspicious O
, O
so O
I O
opened O
the O
app O
and O
checked O
motion O
detection O
videos O
. O
I O
saw O
my O
father-in-law O
in O
the O
hallway O
, O
dropped O
his O
pants O
, O
and O
literally O
squatted O
down O
, O
and O
defecated B-DIS
and I-DIS
urinated I-DIS
right I-DIS
on I-DIS
the I-DIS
floor I-DIS
. O
Then O
he O
grabbed O
feces O
into O
his O
hands O
and O
threw O
away O
into O
the O
trash O
can O
. O
After O
doing O
it O
, O
he O
simply O
walked O
away O
as O
nothing O
happened O
. O
He O
didn O
t O
tell O
anything O
about O
it O
to O
me O
as O
well O
. O
I O
was O
flooded O
with O
too O
many O
emotions O
disgust O
, O
I O
have O
to O
admit O
, O
as O
well O
as O
frustration O
and O
curiosity O
. O
Is O
this O
the O
first O
time O
Who O
even O
knows O
I O
told O
my O
husband O
about O
this O
that O
evening O
. O
He O
thought O
his O
dad O
was O
probably O
incontinent B-DIS
, O
like O
the O
scene O
where O
Julianne O
Moore O
s O
character O
couldn O
t O
find O
the O
washroom O
and O
peed O
on O
herself O
in O
the O
movie O
Still O
Alice O
. O
Reluctantly O
because O
I O
know O
how O
devastating O
it O
can O
be O
for O
him O
, O

A O
great O
deal O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
using O
CBD B-DRUG
strains I-DRUG
, O
for O
a O
few O
years O
now O
and O
as O
part O
of O
my O
treatment O
regimen O
which O
includes O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
amp O
; O
Imurane B-DRUG
I O
find O
it O
really O
helpful O
. O
Most O
of O
my O
strains O
also O
contain O
THC B-DRUG
to O
help O
numb O
the O
pain B-DIS
, O
but O
I O
have O
at O
least O
1 O
or O
2 O
that O
are O
pure O
CBD B-DRUG
. O

The O
neuro O
opthalmologist O
said O
to O
me O
recently O
that O
a O
very O
mild O
ON B-DIS
sign O
is O
red B-DIS
desaturation I-DIS
, O
which O
I O
m O
sure O
you O
could O
easily O
miss O
. O
So O
, O
maybe O

I O
can O
really O
relate O
to O
this O
. O
Everything B-DIS
seems I-DIS
monstrously I-DIS
enormous I-DIS
- O
like O
the O
world O
will O
end O
. O
The O
truth O
I O
suspect O
is O
that O
I O
just O
have O
to O
do O
a O
few O
simple O
things O
to O
solve O
my O
problems O
. O
The O
regret O
that O
comes O
from O
not O
having O
done O
this O
sooner O
, O
thus O
preventing O
me O
from O
being O
in O
the O
position O
I O
m O
in O
now O
, O
makes O
this O
even O
harder O
, O
and O
then O
my O
thoughts O
say O
it O
s O
too O
late O
... O
Then O
the O
fear B-DIS
and I-DIS
panic I-DIS
and I-DIS
anxiety I-DIS
comes O
in O
, O
and O
like O
you O
said O
, O
the O
rational O
part O
gets O
drowned O
out O
. O

Know O
more O
about O
what O
specifically O

I O
know O
people O
who O
did O
well O
on O
seroquel B-DRUG
and O
it O
gave O
them O
their O
lives O
back O
. O
But O
I O
was O
on O
600mg O
daily O
for O
about O
2 O
years O
and O
it O
wiped O
the O
floor O
with O
me O
. O
Massive O
weight B-DIS
gain I-DIS
and O
constant O
zombification O
from O
the O
sedation B-DIS
. O
It O
did O
nothing O
for O
my O
mood O
. O
See O
how O
things O
are O
on O
the O
low O
dose O
, O
only O
take O
it O
at O
night O
, O
and O
if O
you O
have O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
within O
2 O
hours O
of O
taking O
it O
toilet O
trip O
you O
may O
experience O
a O
massive B-DIS
drop I-DIS
in I-DIS
blood I-DIS
pressure I-DIS
. O
Also O
, O
the O
food B-DIS
cravings I-DIS
. O
I O
used O
to O
take O
a O
biscuit O
to O
bed O
in O
case O
my O
cravings O
got O
so O
bad O
that O
the O
only O
option O
was O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
and O
go O
make O
food O
. O
Trying O
to O
boil O
an O
egg O
when O
you O
are O

Echoing O
increased O
protein O
and O
lower O
overall O
caloric O
intake O
. O
I O
personally O
just O
can O
t O
eat O
that O
much O
veggies O
, O
whole O
grains O
that O
aren O
t O
rice O
, O
or O
other O
foods O
high O
in O
insoluble O
fiber O
which O
are O
normal O

foods O
. O
Red O
meat O
and O
pork O
also O
trigger O
me O
more O
often O
than O
not O
. O
I O
eat O
tuna O
fish O
with O
rice-based O
crackers O
to O
boost O
my O
protein O
intake O
on O
days O
I O
don O
t O
want O
a O
lot O
of O
carbs O
or O
even O
on O
bad O
Crohns B-DIS
days O
I O
also O
tend O
to O
snack O
more O
- O
big O
meals O
are O
too O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
portion O
control O
. O
If O
you O
*can* O
exercise O
it O
s O
great O
but O
I O
generally O
just O
try O
to O
walk O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

Oh O
my O
apologies O
, O
I O
ve O
never O
really O
looked O
into O
FODMAPS O
so O
i O
m O
talking O
out O
my O
arse O
... O
The O
quantities O
of O
these O
are O
often O
very O
small O
in O
comparison O
to O
everything O
else O
as O
have O
to O
watch O
the O
carbs O
, O
also O
. O
Thanks O

Gotcha O
Thank O
you O

I O
have O
been O
dizzy B-DIS
for O
the O
last O
year O
. O
Like O
almost O
everyday O
, O
24 O
7. O
thats O
feeling O
helpless O
because O
nothing O
works O
. O
seriously O
, O
well O
we O
are O
trying O
a O
shots O
of O
steroid B-DRUG
in O
the O
ear O
. O
and O
I O
am O
just O
trying O
get O
over O
this O
shock O
because O
it O
just O
all O
hit O
home O
. O
I O
am O
processing O
. O
and O
stuffs O
. O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
coming O
but O
still O
. O

I O
ve O
tried O
gluten O
free O
and O
Paleo O
and O
felt O
well O
on O
both O
but O
it O
s O
such O
a O
commitment O
and O
it O
s O
increasingly O
hard O
when O
the O
people O
you O
live O
with O
don O
t O
follow O
the O
same O
diet O
. O
I O
don O
t O
have O
strong O
enough O
will O
power O
. O

That O
s O
really O
cool O

How O
does O
the O
doctor O
know O
it O
s O
still O
in O
the O
kidney O
Did O
he O
have O
you O
do O
a O
CT O
scan O
to O
determine O
this O
There O
is O
no O
pain B-DIS
when O
it O
s O
in O
the O
kidney O
. O
Exercise O
can O
make O
it O
come O
out O
of O
the O
kidney O
and O
start O
its O
way O
down O
. O
Apple O
cider O
vinegar O
may O
help O
prevent O
formation O
of O
new O
stones B-DIS
. O

True O
, O
Thanks O
for O
the O
quick O
and O
informative O
replies O

I O
ve O
never O
personally O
tried O
Charlotte O
s O
Web O
, O
but O
the O
folks O
at O
r O
CBD O
should O
be O
able O
to O
recommend O
some O
trustworthy O
vendors O
of O
legal O
hemp-based B-DRUG
CBD I-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
. O

It O
s O
possible O
under O
the O
circumstances O
that O
you O
have O
described O
. O
But O
90 O
blockage O
should O
still O
have O
some O
physical O
manifestations O
. O
If O
it O
s O
that O
a O
single O
blood O
vessel O
is O
blocked O
, O
new O
ones O
are O
made O
all O
the O
time O
, O
contrary O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
, O
those O
veins O
should O
be O
able O
to O
function O
normally O
. O
Based O
on O
these O
pieces O
of O
evidence O
and O
others O
, O
it O
suggests O
to O
me O
that O
this O
is O
something O
that O
is O
highly O
unlikely O
. O
I O
m O
glad O
that O
this O
treatment O
worked O
for O
your O
wife O
and O
I O
hope O
it O
stays O
that O
way O
. O
But O
there O
is O
no O
science O
theoretical O
or O
clinical O
that O
suggest O
to O
most O
researchers O
that O
this O
is O
something O
that O
has O
more O
value O
to O
spend O
research O
funds O
on O
than O
other O
treatments O
. O

The O
Humira B-DRUG
folks O
saved O
my O
life O
. O
They O
are O
the O
best O
, O
shipped O
me O
boxes O
of O
that O
stuff O
for O
free O
for O
two O
years O
. O
I O
thank O
them O
every O
day O
, O
contact O
them O
and O
they O
will O
take O
care O
of O
you O
. O
God O
bless O
Humira B-DRUG

thats O
great O
to O
read O
, O
progression O
is O
always O
nice O
try O
to O
maintain O
it O
, O
as O
its O
safe O
to O
know O
that O
there O
will O
be O
times O
like O
those O
you O
came O
from O
. O
i O
feel O
rather O
shallow O
to O
write O
that O
stuff O
, O
but O
when O
i O
learned O
one O
thing O
the O
hard O
way O
is O
, O
to O
not O
indulge O
too O
much O
into O
remission O
. O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
remission O
is O
no O
one O
way O
road O
. O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
snares O
. O

It O
sounds O
like O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
put O
you O
in O
a O
good O
mindset O
. O
I O
can O
relate O
since O
, O
I O
believe O
my O
CFS B-DIS
symptoms O
are O
from O
Sinusitis B-DIS
, O
and O
won O
t O
be O
able O
to O
fully O
fix O
it O
for O
a O
month O
or O
two O
, O
So O
I O
can O
either O
push O
on O
my O
HW O
and O
try O
to O
pass O
my O
classes O
or O
give O
in O
and O
browse O
reddit O
all O
day O
. O

I O
also O
use O
Saltstick B-DRUG
. O
I O
have O
no O
adverse O
reactions O
to O
it O
. O

Alright O
thanks O
, O
what O
s O
the O
treatment O
for O
subclinical B-DIS
hypothyroidism I-DIS
I O
don O
t O
want O
any O
more O
fuck O
ups O
from O
the O
doc O
, O
she O
had O
more O
than O
one O
over O
the O
years O
. O

Healthy O
people O
get O
an O
unlimited O
amount O
of O
spoons O
what O
they O
can O
accomplish O
in O
a O
day O
. O
Chronically O
ill O
people O
have O
a O
limited O
amount O
of O
spoons O
we O
can O
only O
do O
so O
much O
in O
a O
day O
before O
feeling O
exhausted B-DIS
. O

I O
ve O
been O
taking O
MTX B-DRUG
for O
about O
2.5 O
years O
. O
I O
started O
at O
10mg O
week O
, O
and O
it O
was O
really O
rough O
. O
I O
took O
them O
Friday O
night O
so O
I O
could O
sleep O
in O
as O
late O
as O
I O
needed O
on O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
usually O
felt O
pretty O
wiped O
out O
until O
at O
least O
later O
afternoon O
on O
that O
day O
. O
I O
also O
had O
some O
pretty O
rough O
brain B-DIS
fog I-DIS
-- O
slow B-DIS
processing I-DIS
, O
stubborn B-DIS
memory I-DIS
, O
all O
that O
awful O
stuff O
. O
But O
I O
think O
it O
dissipated O
over O
the O
course O
of O
about O
a O
year O
and O
half O
. O
I O
m O
up O
15mg O
week O
but O
I O
don O
t O
need O
to O
sleep O
in O
after O
and O
I O
can O
work O
out O
the O
next O
day O
. O
I O
also O
think O
the O
brain B-DIS
fog I-DIS
is O
pretty O
much O
over O
for O
now O
. O
But O
it O
took O
some O
time O
. O
It O
won O
t O
last O
forever O
, O
but O
please O
have O
patience O
. O
I O
m O
really O
active O
, O
physically O
and O
intellectually O
, O
so O
it O
took O
a O
heavy O
toll O
on O
my O
emotions O
and O
how O
I O
saw O
see O
myself O
. O
Therapy O
was O
really O
helpful O
for O
that O
. O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
what O
your O
options O
are O
, O
but O
if O
your O
wife O
is O
open O
to O
it O
and O
it O
s O
accessible O
, O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
a O
shot O
. O
I O
definitely O
suffer O
fatigue B-DIS
much O
easier O
than O
I O
did O
when O
I O
was O
younger O
, O
and O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
s O
the O
RA B-DIS
itself O
, O
or O
the O
meds O
, O
or O
both O
. O
That O
hasn O
t O
gone O
away O
-- O
I O
need O
more O
sleep O
and O
a O
really O
healthy O
diet O
to O
function O
at O
the O
level O
I O
need O
to O
. O
It O
will O
get O
better O
. O
It O
will O
just O
take O
time O
. O

Be O
kind O
to O
yourself O
. O
I O
know O
even O
trivial O
things O
feel O
absolutely O
exhausting O
and O
impossible O
. O
But O
take O
your O
time O
, O
take O
deep O
breaths O
, O
meditate O
, O
and O
set O
small O
achievable O
goals O
. O
Like O
writing O
this O
post O

Thank O
you O
. O
I O
called O
my O
former O
supplier O
and O
they O
said O
they O
will O
take O
care O
of O
it O
. O
If O
that O
falls O
through O
, O
I O
will O
use O
your O
suggestion O
. O

Because O
going O
through O
with O
it O
is O
worse O
than O
cancer B-DIS
. O
So O
much O
worse O
. O
It O
is O
or O
their O
own O
good O
. O
Their O
story O
is O
coming O
to O
a O
close O
and O
if O
the O
last O
chapters O
had O
a O
bit O
more O
editing O
it O
would O
be O
a O
better O
story O
. O

Pain B-DIS
after O
removal O
-- O
discomfort B-DIS
for O
48 O
hours O
then O
it O
was O
like O
it O
ever O
happened O
. O

I O
giggle O
every O
time O
I O
see O
your O
name O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
lols O
. O

Then O
what O
were O
the O
two O
votes O
this O
week O
by O
the O
house O
and O
senate O
Both O
of O
which O
won O
to O
repeal O
some O
parts O
of O
it O
I O
thought O
this O
new O
budget O
would O
get O
rid O
of O
pre-existing O
conditions O
and O
staying O
on O
parents O
insurance O
on O
March O
3rd O
I O
could O
be O
completely O
wrong O
but O
that O
s O
what O
I O
gathered O
from O
the O
articles O
I O
read O
. O
Congress O
vote O
was O
on O
Friday O
and O
Senate O
vote O
was O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

Instead O
of O
being O
in O
the O
hospital O
for O
your O
steroid B-DRUG
IV I-DRUG
, O
can O
you O
get O
a O
visiting O
nurse O
to O
do O
it O
after O
work O
at O
night O
At O
least O
to O
potentially O
get O
you O
through O
the O
4 O
month O
wait O
for O
FMLA O
. O

Didn O
t O
even O
think O
of O
that O

How O
did O
you O
find O
out O
about O
POTS B-DIS
if O
you O
don O
t O
mind O
me O
asking O
I O
m O
always O
amazed O
that O
people O
know O
about O
it O
to O
even O
come O
and O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
think O
here O
on O
this O
forum O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
find O
out O
about O
POTS B-DIS
until O
I O
d O
done O
two O
years O
of O
online O
research O
to O
figure O
out O
why O
my O
health O
was O
deteriorating O
. O
Anyway O
, O
if O
you O
think O
this O
is O
totally O
caused O
by O
deconditioning O
and O
you O
re O
not O
having O
any O
other O
symptoms O
beyond O
the O
increase B-DIS
in I-DIS
heart I-DIS
rate I-DIS
, O
then O
I O
think O
you O
should O
get O
to O
the O
gym O
. O
If O
working O
out O
on O
something O
like O
a O
treadmill O
is O
hard O
because O
of O
the O
standing O
, O
then O
start O
on O
a O
recumbent O
bike O
or O
a O
rowing O
machine O
and O
do O
the O
leg O
strengthening O
machines O
. O
If O
your O
leg O
muscles O
are O
stronger O
, O
it O
s O
going O
to O
help O
your O
blood O
vessels O
constrict O
and O
push O
the O
blood O
back O
up O
to O
your O
heart O
when O
you O
stand O
. O
I O
don O
t O
really O
know O
how O
long O
it O
would O
take O
to O
resolve O
itself O
... O
I O
can O
t O
imagine O
it O
d O
be O
too O
long O
. O

I O
m O
a O
desk O
jockey O
, O
a O
paper O
pusher O
, O
a O
sedentary O
staff O
member O
. O
I O
told O
my O
current O
employer O
upfront O
about O
my O
problems O
. O
I O
do O
have O
to O
hold O
on O
sometimes O
for O
phone O
coverage O
from O
my O
supervisor O
, O
but O
I O
m O
allowed O
to O
leave O
my O
desk O
in O
emergency O
cases O
. O

In O
some O
cases O
probably O
but O
my O
natropath O
has O
a O
medical O
degree O
as O
well O
. O
And O
honestly O
she O
s O
figured O
out O
a O
problem O
that O
multiple O
doctors O
and O
specialists O
haven O
t O
. O

That O
is O
in O
there O
, O
many O
times O
over O
I O
empathize O
with O
you O
completely O
. O
I O
am O
an O
introvert O
by O
nature O
and O
the O
symptoms O
and O
anxiety B-DIS
that O
come O
with O
GP B-DIS
basically O
ground O
my O
social O
life O
to O
a O
halt O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
it O
s O
probably O
the O
thing O
that O
I O
struggle O
with O
the O
most O
now O
, O
15 O
years O
in O
, O
even O
though O
I O
ve O
gotten O
a O
much O
better O
handle O
on O
things O
. O
There O
s O
definitely O
no O
one-fix-for-all O
, O
but O
I O
do O
talk O
about O
this O
, O
as O
well O
as O
ways O
to O
try O
to O
be O
creative O
in O
solving O
these O
problems O
and O
being O
forgiving O
to O
yourself O
. O
I O
really O
hope O
that O
you O
are O
able O
to O
find O
your O
solution O
for O
getting O
your O
life O
and O
your O
happiness O
back O
. O
Thank O
you O
for O
providing O
this O
input O

Heh O
, O
thanks O
bill O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
very O
thoughtful O
response O
. O
This O
is O
all O
very O
helpful O
. O

Thanks O
for O
sharing O
. O
Your O
history O
is O
pretty O
similar O
to O
mine O
, O
I O
also O
ended O
up O
diagnosing O
myself O
after O
a O
year O
with O
several O
ENTs O
. O
In O
my O
case O
, O
I O
started O
with O
the O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
and O
ear B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
. O
I O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
with O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
and O
then O
I O
would O
be O
ok O
for O
weeks O
. O
After O
some O
time O
, O
I O
could B-DIS
not I-DIS
recover I-DIS
my I-DIS
hearing I-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
left I-DIS
ear I-DIS
. O
Vertigo B-DIS
was O
the O
last O
symptom O
for O
me O
, O
and O
even O
when O
I O
told O
my O
ENT O
about O
my O
first O
vertigo B-DIS
attack I-DIS
, O
he O
told O
me O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
my O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
. O
Then O
I O
decided O
to O
change O
doctors O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
am O
in O
betahistamin B-DRUG
and O
I O
haven O
t O
had O
a O
mayor O
vertigo B-DIS
attack O
in O
the O
last O
year O
, O
only O
small O
ones O
. O
My O
sense B-DIS
of I-DIS
balance I-DIS
is I-DIS
permanently I-DIS
damaged I-DIS
though O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
get O
better O
. O
Just O
know O
we O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
going O
through O
. O

What O
s O
fmt O

Two O
weeks O
My O
gastroenterologist O
said O
I O
have O
to O
be O
on O
it O
for O
LIFE O
. O
According O
to O
him O
, O
there O
is O
no O
cure O
, O
just O
maintenance O
treatment O
. O
I O
was O
on O
it O
for O
six O
months O
, O
tried O
to O
come O
off O
of O
it O
and O
, O
within O
two O
months O
, O
was O
back O
to O
square O
one O
. O
You O
do O
definitely O
need O
real O
testing O
radioactive O
eggs O
to O
get O
a O
definitive O
diagnosis O
, O
but O
, O
as O
per O
my O
GI O
, O
treatment O
is O
for O
life O
. O

Look O
for O
the O
bottle O
that O
says O
mother O
on O
it O
. O
Its O
referring O
to O
having O
probiotics B-DRUG
in O
it O
. O
Being O
in O
its O
raw O
liquid O
state O
, O
it O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
nutrients O
. O
It O
helped O
with O
heartburn B-DIS
problems O
I O
had O
in O
the O
past O
also O
. O
But O
my O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
has O
mostly O
gone O
away O
since O
I O
made O
the O
organic O
switch O
and O
started O
caring O
about O
my O
gut O
flora O

I O
ve O
been O
needing O
this O
information O
, O
too O
Thanks O
to O
all O
commenters O
and O
OP O
for O
asking O

What O
you O
re O
describing O
sounds O
like O
what O
I O
dealt O
with O
when O
I O
was O
younger O
. O
You O
may O
just O
have O
a O
more O
mild O
case O
of O
IBS B-DIS
. O
I O
had O
the O
same O
symptoms O
until O
5 O
years O
ago O
or O
so O
, O
when O
I O
went O
through O
a O
period O
of O
extreme B-DIS
stress I-DIS
and O
my O
symptoms O
worsened O
. O
Things O
have O
been O
bad O
ever O
since O
, O
though O
I O
m O
finally O
starting O
to O
get O
a O
handle O
on O
it O
again O
. O
It O
was O
actually O
my O
therapist O
who O
mentioned O
that O
I O
might O
have O
IBS B-DIS
. O
Even O
though O
your O
case O
is O
mild O
now O
, O
you O
should O
still O
try O
low O
FODMAP O
and O
see O
if O
you O
can O
isolate O
the O
foods O
that O
aggravate O
your O
condition O
. O
Avoiding O
those O
foods O
as O
and O
keeping O
your O
stress B-DIS
anxiety B-DIS
under O
control O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
may O
help O
keep O
your O
symptoms O
mild O
or O
even O
eliminate O
them O
and O
hopefully O
prevent O
a O
worse O
time O
down O
the O
road O
. O

Funny O
story O
, O
that O
s O
the O
place O
that O
helped O
me O
get O
diagnosed O
. O
I O
ate O
a O
huge O
piece O
of O
chocolate O
cake O
there O
and O
felt O
like O
shit O
for O
days O
. O
Along O
with O
the O
peeing B-DIS
, O
puking B-DIS
and O
weight B-DIS
loss I-DIS
, O
we O
knew O
something O
was O
wrong O
. O

gt O
; O
just O
depends O
on O
how O
I O
m O
feeling O
that O
day O
and O
if O
I O
end O
up O
being O
able O
to O
stomach O
that O
much O
salt O
. O
I O
had O
some O
problems O
early O
on O
with O
salting O
food O
or O
trying O
to O
eat O
it O
plain O
... O
but O
now O
I O
dissolve O
it O
into O
water O
and O
drink O
that O
throughout O
the O
day O
. O
No O
more O
stomachaches B-DIS
I O
used O
to O
drink O
a O
ton O
of O
water O
, O
up O
to O
5 O
liters O
a O
day O
, O
because O
I O
felt O
dehydrated B-DIS
all O
the O
time O
. O
Now O
, O
drinking O
salt O
water O
, O
I O
m O
down O
to O
only O
2 O
liters O
- O
a O
healthy O
amount O
- O
and O
feeling O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

All O
of O
these O
Omega B-DRUG
3 I-DRUG
too O

Thanks O
, O
that O
a O
great O
idea O
. O
We O
use O
fake O
bacon O
bits O
on O
lots O
of O
stuff O

I O
understand O
it O
s O
status O
as O
an O
umbrella O
term O
for O
like O
symptoms O
so O
I O
am O
not O
frustrated O
with O
it O
*not* O
being O
MD O
rather O
than O
I O
am O
with O
the O
ambiguity O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
territory O
. O
Which O
I O
imagine O
is O
something O
every O
one O
must O
go O
through O
. O
I O
just O
wish O
I O
could O
nail O
down O
some O
sort O
of O
treatment O
or O
lifestyle O
habit O
that O
mitigates O
these O
but O
they O
all O
have O
come O
up O
. O
Luckily O
mine O
have O
yet O
to O
get O
too O
frequent O
. O
I O
have O
had O
an O
MRI O
in O
the O
past O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
looking O
for O
treatment O
but O
they O
didn O
t O
show O
anything O
. O
I O
don O
t O
even O
remember O
it O
s O
purpose O
though O
. O
What O
do O
you O
think O
an O
MRI O
could O
would O
show O

Maybe O
ask O
her O
GP O
, O
if O
she O
has O
one O
, O
to O
call O
her O
in O
for O
a O
general O
checkup O
and O
then O
do O
an O
evaluation O
of O
her O
mental O
state O
I O
think O
if O
the O
country O
she O
is O
in O
has O
poor O
healthcare O
, O
maybe O
getting O
a O
diagnosis O
sooner O
than O
later O
would O
allow O
you O
to O
get O
her O
placed O
on O
the O
waiting O
list O
for O
whatever O
State O
care O
home O
facilities O
there O
are O
, O
with O
more O
chance O
of O
actually O
being O
placed O
. O

As O
someone O
who O
has O
a O
blanket O
buying O
habit O
... O
it O
honestly O
depends O
on O
the O
night O
. O
I O
have O
thinner O
sherpa O
blankets O
that O
do O
the O
trick O
sometimes O
, O
other O
times O
it O
s O
just O
a O
sheet O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
want O
no O
blanket O
on O
me O
and O
I O
m O
overheating O
no O
matter O
what O
. O
Layers O
are O
the O
best O
. O
Also O
a O
fan O
with O
a O
remote O
that O
you O
could O
click O
on O
without O
getting O
out O
of O
bed O
. O

Interesting O
At O
87 O
if O
it O
helps O
her O
, O
all O
the O
better O
It O
not O
only O
is O
an O
opiate O
, O
but O
will O
increase O
serotonin O
. O
So O
you O
feel O
good O
, O
as O
long O
as O
she O
doesn O
t O
over O
do O
it O
. O
Catch O
is O
over O
time O
the O
brain O
adjust O
to O
the O
medication O
, O
so O
she O
may O
need O
a O
higher O
dose O
to O
maintain O
that O
happiness O
. O
My O
biggest O
issues O
with O
any O
opiate O
is O
it O
shuts O
down O
my O
colon O
. O
I O
can O
not O
take O
pain O
killers O
as O
I O
no B-DIS
longer I-DIS
poop I-DIS
Everything O
backs O
up O
, O
and O
so O
my O
Sinemet B-DRUG
never O
makes O
it O
to O
my O
little O
intestine O
where O
is O
needs O
to O
be O
absorbed O
. O
Thankfully O
I O
can O
chew O
up O
a O
levodopa B-DRUG
carbidopa B-DRUG
tablet I-DRUG
best O
is O
to O
chew O
one O
up O
and O
take O
with O
orange O
juice O
to O
help O
get O
things O
moving O
again O
. O
Give O
her O
my O
best O
. O

For O
me O
the O
loss B-DIS
of I-DIS
hearing I-DIS
and O
constant B-DIS
tinnitus I-DIS
are O
a O
minor O
inconvenience O
compared O
to O
the O
absolute O
incapacitation O
of O
a O
vertigo B-DIS
attack I-DIS
. O
I O
would O
happily O
keep O
the O
deafness B-DIS
and O
tinnitus B-DIS
if O
I O
could O
just O
never O
ever O
have O
another O
vertigo B-DIS
attack I-DIS
. O
Heck O
, O
if O
I O
could O
just O
go O
back O
to O
normal O
migraines B-DIS
that O
cause O
temporary B-DIS
blindness I-DIS
and O
pain B-DIS
instead O
of O
vertigo B-DIS
, O
that O
would O
be O
ok O
too O
. O

update O
.. O
2 O
months O
later O
I O
have O
yet O
to O
be O
able O
to O
give O
it O
to O
myself O
. O
As O
of O
last O
week O
my O
boyfriend O
left O
for O
south O
america O
to O
do O
some O
work O
.. O
therefore O
my O
easy O
injections O
in O
my O
arm O
by O
him O
are O
out O
of O
the O
question O
. O
I O
asked O
the O
doctor O
for O
tb O
syringes O
and O
she O
looked O
at O
me O
kinda O
funny O
, O
but O
pxed O
them O
. O
Do O
I O
take O
the O
risk O
and O
do O
Subq B-DRUG
... O
even O
though O
Im O
used O
to O
the O
IM B-DRUG
I O
m O
currently O
on O
0.6 O
ml O

No O
problem O
, O
I O
really O
hope O
this O
helps O
Yes O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
most O
people O
, O
especially O
in O
early O
stages O
, O
are O
very O
aware O
that O
something O
is O
worng O
with O
them O
. O
From O
what O
I O
expirienced O
, O
and O
also O
, O
what O
a O
lot O
of O
theories O
state O
, O
is O
that O
most O
of O
the O
strange B-DIS
behaviour I-DIS
in O
this O
stage O
is O
caused O
by O
their O
efforts O
to O
hide O
this O
. O
But O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
admit O
that O
, O
especially O
to O
the O
family O
. O
Telling O
you O
daughter O
that O
you O
are O
scared B-DIS
and O
don O
t O
know O
what O
s O
going O
on O
must O
feel O
horrible O
, O
that O
s O
why O
they O
rather O
not O
. O
Even O
I O
as O
someone O
with O
no O
past O
with O
them O
or O
my O
collegues O
need O
to O
build O
a O
really O
high O
level O
of O
trust O
and O
have O
to O
act O
really O
professional O
, O
and O
even O
then O
only O
a O
minjority O
of O
people O
actually O
talk O
about O
those O
feelings O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
. O
Oh O
yes O
, O
you O
don O
t O
even O
wan O
na O
know O
what O
kind O
of O
behaviour O
some O
other O
people O
develop O
, O
it O
s O
really O
interesting O
what O
kind O
of O
desires O
or O
coping O
methods O
seem O
to O
come O
out O
when O
some O
blockades B-DIS
in I-DIS
the I-DIS
brain I-DIS
dissapear O
. O
I O
guess O
my O
all O
time O
favourite O
will O
always O
be O
I O
m O
an O
orthopedic O
insulin B-DRUG
specialist O

It O
should O
not O
be O
thick O
. O
How O
much O
water O
do O
you O
drink O
a O
day O
You O
should O
drink O
enough O
to O
produce O
at O
least O
2 O
liters O
of O
urine O
. O
What O
color O
is O
your O
urine O
It O
should O
be O
pale O
. O
It O
s O
possible O
you O
have O
an O
infection B-DIS
or O
there O
is O
another O
kidney B-DIS
issue I-DIS
going O
on O
. O
You O
should O
see O
a O
urologist O
for O
a O
urinalysis O
. O

Yep O
. O
She O
only O
needs O
it O
a O
few O
days O
a O
month O
, O
when O
things O
are O
bad- O
during O
off O
periods O
she O
is O
more O
prone O
to O
those O
than O
most O
, O
don O
t O
let O
it O
scare O
you O
too O
much O
. O
Luckily O
, O
Parkinson O
s O
is O
among O
the O
easiest O
of O
diseases O
to O
get O
on O
SSDI B-DRUG
for O
which O
is O
a O
VERY O
difficult O
thing O
to O
do O
, O
something O
like O
75 O
of O
all O
claims O
are O
denied O
the O
first O
time O
and O
from O
this O
lovely O
link O
it O
looks O
like O
Canada O
s O
disability O
pension O
is O
similar O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
don O
t O
have O
Parkinson O
s O
as O
well O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
, O
at O
least O
it O
won O
t O
be O
a O
struggle O
to O
get O
help O
. O
My O
Dad O
had O
another O
type O
of O
issue O
and O
flirted O
with O
homelessness O
a O
few O
times O
when O
we O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
him O
assistance O
, O
so O
this O
is O
a O
real O
blessing O
. O
My O
wife O
has O
a O
pretty O
good O
life O
. O
She O
has O
a O
more O
active O
social O
life O
than O
I O
do O
since O
when O
she O
s O
having O
a O
good O
day O
she O
can O
drive O
just O
fine O
still O
, O
and O
get O
into O
the O
nearest O
city O
for O
lunches O
and O
munches O
, O
plays O
a O
lot O
of O
video O
games O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
her O
passions O
even O
though O
we O
have O
specialty O
weighted O
controllers O
and O
adjust O
settings O
depending O
on O
how O
bad O
the O
hand B-DIS
tremors I-DIS
are O
, O
and O
like O
I O
mentioned O
, O
she O
s O
moved O
her O
focus O
from O
police O
work O
to O
being O
a O
science O
fiction O
and O
fantasy O
author O
. O
She O
s O
not O
making O
any O
money O
from O
it O
, O
but O
as O
a O
science O
fiction O
nerd O
, O
she O
wrote O
enough O
high O
quality O
fan O
fiction O
in O
the O
Star O
Wars O
universe O
that O
she O
was O
actually O
approached O
by O
Disney O
to O
write O
cannon- O
which O
is O
epic O
, O
and O
awesome O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
she O
gets O
over O
her O
fears O
of O
rejection O
and O
shyness O

Extremes O
of O
hot O
and O
cold O
are O
difficult O
for O
me O
. O
I O
live O
in O
Florida O
so O
most O
off O
the O
cold O
I O
feel O
is O
air O
conditioned O
. O
I O
try O
to O
stay O
out O
of O
the O
heat O
of O
the O
day O
enjoying O
the O
great O
outdoors O
in O
the O
morning O
or O
evening O
. O
Stay O
well O
hydrated O
is O
always O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

There O
are O
many O
types O
of O
jobs O
you O
can O
get O
, O
like O
having O
a O
PHD O
would O
definitely O
open O
so O
many O
doors O
for O
you O
in O
terms O
of O
even O
having O
specialized O
jobs O
without O
many O
hours O
. O
I O
think O
it O
s O
about O
finding O
a O
job O
or O
career O
that O
suits O
your O
type O
of O
BPD B-DIS
, O
which O
might O
be O
the O
type O
that O
comes O
out O
the O
most O
during O
times O
of O
stress B-DIS
. O
Like O
you O
just O
need O
to O
be O
self O
aware O
, O
to O
know O
your O
own O
triggers O
and O
your O
own O
ability O
to O
cope O
in O
stressful O
situations O
. O
Like O
if O
you O
re O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
you O
re O
going O
to O
be O
in O
a O
high O
level O
stress O
job O
like O
a O
doctor O
or O
a O
lawyer O
, O
maybe O
you O
re O
in O
the O
wrong O
field O
. O
Really O
I O
m O
just O
speculating O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
from O
your O
post O
and O
that O
added O
extra O
info O
about O
you O
doing O
a O
PHD O
that O
you O
are O
a O
high O
achiever O
or O
have O
the O
all O
or O
nothing O
approach O
to O
success O
and O
jobs O
, O
or O
are O
putting O
yourself O
under O
more O
stress O
than O
you O
can O
handle O
and O
breaking O
under O
it O
and O
therefore O
seeing O
yourself O
as O
a O
failure O
. O
Also O
BPD B-DIS
isn O
t O
exactly O
a O
mental B-DIS
illness I-DIS
, O
it O
s O
a O
personality B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
, O
there O
is O
a O
slight O
difference O
because O
a O
personality B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
can O
be O
dealt O
with O
without O
pills O
and O
things O
while O
a O
real O
mental B-DIS
illness I-DIS
, O
like O
skizophrenia B-DIS
or O
bipolar B-DIS
, O
is O
really O
out O
of O
a O
person O
s O
control O
and O
they O
always O
need O
meds O
. O
Consider O
finding O
aspects O
about O
life O
that O
you O
might O
enjoy O
that O
you O
ve O
never O
thought O
of O
doing O
before O
. O
Such O
as O
going O
on O
a O
6 O
month O
volunteering O
trip O
to O
Kenya O
or O
doing O
a O
course O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
craft O
making O
, O
like O
jewelry O
, O
just O
to O
sort O
of O
mix O
up O
your O
life O
a O
bit O
to O
find O
new O
potential O

I O
feel O
ya O
man O
... O
.from O
my O
last O
surgery O

My O
job O
is O
just O
too O
stressful O
, O
the O
client O
isn O
t O
following O
any O
procedures O
they O
themselves O
have O
established O
and O
my O
boss O
doesn O
t O
really O
stand O
by O
us O
. O
I O
am O
extremely O
frustrated O
. O
But O
my O
mom O
and O
my O
brotgher O
work O
for O
an O
organic O
retailer O
and O
they O
told O
me O
that O
they O
have O
big O
projects O
that O
should O
be O
in O
my O
area O
of O
expertise O
. O
I O
called O
them O
on O
monday O
, O
told O
them O
what O
I O
do O
and O
they O
were O
interested O
. O
No O
openings O
right O
now O
, O
but O
they O
are O
interested O
. O
I O
wrote O
a O
motivation O
text O
that O
I O
think O
is O
very O
good O
. O
On O
top O
of O
it O
all O
m O
brother O
told O
me O
he O
met O
one O
of O
the O
team O
leaders O
in O
the O
company O
that O
could O
be O
a O
team O
for O
me O
. O
THis O
guy O
, O
after O
talking O
with O
my O
brother O
, O
discovered O
that O
we O
did O
hang O
out O
at O
the O
same O
places O
, O
had O
the O
same O
friends O
and O
did O
the O
same O
things O
at O
around O
sixteen O
seventeen O
years O
old O
. O
So O
we O
must O
know O
each O
other O
, O
although O
I O
can O
t O
really O
remember O
him O
that O
good O
. O
Fingers O
crossed O
they O
want O
me O
as O
an O
employee O

Derp O
. O
Just O
waking O
up O
lol O

Pretty O
much O
what O
I O
m O
getting O
from O
it O
. O
If O
I O
m O
like O
this O
for O
5 O
more O
days O
I O
m O
calling O
it O
. O

Oh O
gotcha O
. O
Yeah O
, O
I O
m O
used O
to O
having O
a O
resting O
heart O
rate O
in O
the O
low O
40 O
s O
to O
mid O
30 O
s. O
So O
I O
m O
sure O
I O
ll O
be O
fine O
. O

I O
understand O
that O
to O
a O
point O
. O
I O
think O
perhaps O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
living O
is O
to O
surround O
yourself O
with O
good O
, O
like O
minded O
people O
. O
In O
that O
case O
you O
are O
absolutely O
correct O
. O
I O
have O
hobbies O
. O
I O
enjoy O
music O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
over O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
, O
any O
money O
I O
have O
earned O
and O
spent O
has O
been O
put O
in O
to O
what O
is O
now O
, O
a O
respectable O
studio O
. O
I O
spend O
10 O
hours O
a O
day O
producing O
. O
I O
have O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O
. O
But O
it O
s O
all O
meaningless O
, O
if O
I O
don O
t O
have O
other O
people O
who O
are O
able O
to O
appreciate O
it O
with O
me O
. O
I O
suppose O
you O
re O
right O
, O
we O
get O
to O
associate O
with O
those O
that O
we O
want O
to O
now O
that O
we O
are O
adults O
and O
I O
guess O
that O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
I O
guess O
my O
problem O
is O
, O
like O
I O
said O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
how O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
anymore O
. O
I O
ve O
chosen O
this O
path O
, O
largely O
due O
to O
certain O
circumstances O
and O
experiences O
. O
I O
m O
in O
a O
rut O
, O
where O
I O
don O
t O
even O
want O
to O
bother O
trying O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
anymore O
due O
to O
my O
past O
experiences O
with O
people O
. O
It O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
hole O
to O
get O
out O
of O
. O
Ive O
been O
trying O
for O
5 O
years O
. O
It O
s O
hard O
to O
keep O
trying O
sometimes O
. O
It O
took O
you O
ten O
years O
. O
Some O
people O
are O
stronger O
than O
others O
I O
know O
, O
but O
man O
I O
can O
t O
take O
another O
6 O
months O
. O
I O
know O
I O
can O
t O
ask O
for O
a O
miracle O
, O
all O
I O
can O
ask O
for O
is O
experience O
. O
And O
I O
really O
appreciate O
you O
sharing O
yours O
. O

Did O
you O
ever O
manage O
to O
get O
a O
confirmed O
diagnosis O
for O
h-pots B-DIS
My O
fiance O
has O
been O
confirmed O
as O
having O
pots B-DIS
by O
mayo O
twice O
, O
but O
we O
have O
strong O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
it O
might O
be O
h-pots B-DIS
, O
but O
we O
can O
t O
seem O
to O
get O
any O
testing O
done O
for O
it O
because O
the O
facilities O
here O
are O
ill-equipped O
or O
we O
only O
get O
replies O
of O
lol O
what O
s O
pots B-DIS
. O
Mayo O
has O
been O
less O
than O
helpful O
with O
us O
too O
. O
They O
were O
the O
first O
ones O
we O
contacted O
that O
knew O
of O
the O
blood O
test O
that O
s O
needed O
but O
refused O
to O
perform O
it O
. O
Hell O
she O
finally O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
to O
be O
done O
today O
for O
it O
, O
only O
for O
the O
lab O
to O
call O
her O
and O
her O
doctor O
and O
say O
they O
won O
t O
use O
the O
standing O
blood O
draw O
for O
testing O
because O
it O
s O
unusual O
and O
they O
don O
t O
know O
what O
pots B-DIS
is O
. O
Even O
after O
talking O
to O
her O
and O
her O
doctor O
again O
they O
refuse O
. O
As O
per O
why O
we O
think O
it O
s O
h-pots B-DIS
it O
s O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
same O
things O
you O
mention O
. O
her O
blood B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
and I-DIS
heart I-DIS
rate I-DIS
will I-DIS
spike I-DIS
, O
often O
so O
high O
that O
it O
causes O
fainting B-DIS
spells I-DIS
. O
she O
s O
lit O
up O
twice O
on O
a O
tilt O
table O
for O
pots B-DIS
, O
and O
in O
the O
past O
they O
ve O
tried O
the O
typical O
treatment O
of O
beta B-DRUG
blockers I-DRUG
with O
her O
and O
she O
responded O
very O
poorly O
to O
it O
, O
something O
to O
my O
understanding O
is O
very O
typical O
with O
h-pots B-DIS
sufferers O
. O
It O
just O
feels O
like O
we O
re O
running O
out O
of O
options O
here O
with O
something O
that O
might O
be O
an O
answer O
that O
s O
staring O
us O
in O
the O
face O
. O
Even O
if O
it O
s O
not O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
it O
ruled O
out O
so O
we O
can O
move O
on O
. O
She O
s O
unable O
to O
work O
because O
of O
the O
fainting B-DIS
, O
and O
because O
of O

You O
ll O
actually O
be O
awake O
more O
after O
exercising O
. O
I O
m O
trying O
to O
force O
myself O
to O
go O
back O
but O
can O
t O
take O
the O
first O
leap O

You O
always O
have O
calcium O
in O
your O
body O
, O
you O
need O
it O
for O
bones O
. O
I O
would O
still O
lean O
towards O
calcium B-DRUG
oxalate I-DRUG
until O
you O
know O
for O
sure O
, O
especially O
since O
you O
are O
a O
vegetarian O
. O
Drink O
lots O
of O
water O
and O
try O
to O
put O
some O
lemon O
juice O
in O
your O
water O
. O
It O
can O
t O
hurt O
you O
and O
it O
will O
help O
if O
your O
stones B-DIS
actually O
are O
calcium O
oxalate O
. O

, O
she O
has O
6 O
novels O
ready O
to O
go O
, O
and O
they O
re O
all O
quite O
good O
. O
So O
, O
while O
it O
does O
suck O
, O
I O
really O
mean O
it O
when O
i O
say O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
your O
life O
is O
over O
. O
It O
just O
means O
that O
your O
life O
changes O
, O
and O
that O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
anyway O
, O
ya O
know O
It O
s O
a O
curve O
ball O
, O
but O
one O
you O
can O
handle O
. O
Frankly O
it O
s O
easier O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
curve O
balls O
my O
friends O
have O
been O
handed- O
I O
would O
say O
a O
young O
onset O
diagnosis O
is O
1,000 O
times O
easier O
than O
a O
special O
needs O
child O
, O
and O
while O
it O
can O
change O
your O
life O
it O
s O
not O
going O
to O
significantly O
shorten O
your O
life O
expectancy O
like O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
things O
. O
I O
ll O
keep O
my O
fingers O
crossed O
for O
you O

If O
it O
s O
a O
good O
ENT O
, O
he O
will O
refer O
you O
to O
get O
an O
MRI O
, O
EConch O
and O
C-Vemp O
tests O
these O
are O
Meniere O
s O
Specific O
as O
well O
as O
a O
comprehensive O
audiology O
exam O
. O
I O
had O
those O
done O
and O
it O
resulted O
in O
the O
discovery O
of O
my O
Meniere O
s. O
good O
luck O
and O
may O
you O
have O
symptom O
free O
days O
. O

MD O
symptoms O
varies O
from O
person O
to O
person O
. O
No O
two O
patients O
are O
same O
. O
In O
my O
case O
, O
Betahistamine B-DRUG
helped O
me O
for O
4 O
months O
. O
I O
was O
without O
symptoms O
for O
4 O
months O
except O
tinnitus B-DIS
. O
Life O
was O
good O
. O
But O
later O
all O
these O
symptoms O
returned O
. O
I O
tred O
Betahistamine O
second O
time O
again O
but O
it O
didn O
t O
helped O
me O
and O
made O
me O
terribly O
nauseating B-DIS
. O
Between O
vertigo B-DIS
and O
nausea O
, O
I O
will O
pick O
vertigo O
anyday O
- O
the O
lesser O
evil O
. O
Nausea O
is O
terrible O
. O
I O
am O
not O
on O
any O
medication O
right O
now O
. O
As O
per O
my O
observation O
, O
alternate O
days O
my O
symptoms O
are O
less O
. O
You O
should O
speak O
to O
your O
doc O
and O
give O
Betahistamines O
a O
go O
. O
Maybe O
it O
will O
work O
for O
you O
. O
Besides O
symptoms O
have O
highs O
and O
low O
days.Your O
symptoms O
seem O
to O
be O
mild O
. O
You O
ll O
learn O
to O
cope O
. O
Don O
t O
worry O
, O
control O
your O
anxiety O
and O
half O
the O
battle O
is O
won O

Good O

My O

has O
debilitating B-DIS
GP I-DIS
and O
CBD B-DRUG
oils I-DRUG
are O
by O
FAR O
the O
best O
medicine O

not O
that O

his O

3-4 O

I O
was O
on O
neoral B-DRUG
cyclosporin B-DRUG
for O
a O
little O
while O
before O
I O
started O
MTX B-DRUG
. O
It O
made O
me O
realllllly O
ill O
, O
like O
, O
vomiting B-DIS
most O
days O
not O
just O
nausea B-DIS
. O
It O
did O
clear O
up O
my O
P O
in O
zero O
time O
at O
all O
though O
. O
As O
a O
result O
, O
when O
I O
went O
onto O
MTX B-DRUG
, O
I O
felt O
so O
much O
better O
in O
comparison O
. O
At O
the O
time O
I O
didn O
t O
have O
the O
best O
lifestyle O
, O
bit O
overweight B-DIS
, O
drinking O
eating O
the O
wrong O
things O
etc O
. O
though O
, O
so O
I O
always O
felt O
a O
bit O
meh O
. O
Sluggish B-DIS
etc O
. O
So O
when O
I O
started O
losing O
weight O
intentionally O
and O
living O
more O
healthier O
, O
I O
noticed O
I O
was O
still O
groggy B-DIS
. O
I O
came O
off O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
for O
several O
months O
over O
a O
summer O
period O
in O
2015 O
when O
it O
had O
cleared O
up O
almost O
fully O
. O
When O
I O
restarted O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
I O
noticed O
it O
made O
me O
very B-DIS
groggy I-DIS
and O
similar O
to O
the O
things O
j0npau1 O
has O
said O
. O
I O
had O
muscle B-DIS
ache I-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
legs I-DIS
a O
lot O
, O
my O
ALT O
levels O
something O
they O
monitor O
from O
the O
liver O
shot O
up O
to O
over O
200 O
should O
be O
under O
20ish O
I O
think O
, O
for O
a O
normal O
adult O
. O
Migraines B-DIS
frequently O
. O
I O
think O
it O
affected B-DIS
my I-DIS
mood I-DIS
a O
little O
too O
but O
this O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
for O
sure O
. O
I O
was O
on O
12.5mg O
once O
a O
week O
. O
I O
came O
off O
it O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
last O
summer O
as O
decided O
it O
wasn O
t O
doing O
my O
body O
any O
favours O
, O
at O
the O
time O
it O
wasn O
t O
too O
bad O
again O
. O
Sadly O
I O
found O
myself O
pregnant O
in O
the O
winter O
, O
despite O
having O
the O
coil O
. O
I O
took O
advice O
and O
although O
it O
wasn O
t O
the O
best O
time O
practically O
anyway O
, O
I O
had O
to O
abort O
at O
an O
early O
stage O

Over O

and O
at O
the O
start O
of O

Hello O
, O
it O
can O
be O
unsettling O
to O
have O
a O
chronic B-DIS
disease I-DIS
. O
But O
hopefully O
, O
he O
and O
you O
can O
take O
a O
deep O
breath O
. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
28 O
years O
ago O
as O
a O
teenager O
and O
am O
now O
12 O
years O
older O
than O
your O
BF O
. O
I O
have O
had O
just O
one O
surgery B-DIS
6 O
years O
ago O
and O
a O
number O
of O
different O
flares B-DIS
, O
but O
this O
disease B-DIS
really O
hasn O
t O
gotten O
in O
the O
way O
of O
my O
life O
. O
I O
m O
in O
the O
US O
and O
enjoy O
traveling O
. O
We O
mostly O
drive O
around O
the O
United O
States O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
also O
been O
able O
to O
spend O
a O
month O
in O
Spain O
. O
I O
was O
in O
the O
boy O
scouts O
when O
I O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
and O
was O
still O
able O
to O
camp O
and O
hike O
just O
fine O
. O
Last O
summer O
, O
my O
family O
and O
I O
just O
spent O
a O
week O
near O
the O
Smokey O
Mountains O
. O
We O
hiked O
various O
waterfall O
trails O
three O
or O
four O
of O
the O
days O
we O
were O
there O
. O
Spent O
another O
day O
tubing O
down O
the O
river O
. O
We O
like O
to O
go O
boating O
and O
fishing O
a O
few O
times O
each O
summer O
also O
. O
There O
are O
other O
public O
figures O
that O
have O
come O
out O
about O
having O
IBD B-DIS
Larry O
Nance O
Jr O
with O
the O
LA O
Lakers O
NBA O
; O
Jake O
Diekman O
of O
the O
Texas O
Rangers O
MLB O
- O
just O
to O
name O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
most O
recent O
, O
vocal O
advocates O
. O
You O
can O
google O
search O
their O
stories O
. O
I O
also O
checked O
out O
your O
other O
thread O
... O
I O
love O
to O
cook O
, O
too O
Your O
BF O
will O
still O
be O
able O
to O
eat O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
will O
find O
that O
certain O
foods O
or O
spices O
don O
t O
agree O
with O
him O
like O
they O
used O
to O
... O
quite O
honestly O
, O
that O
can O
happen O
to O
anyone O
with O
age O
. O
I O
talk O
to O
my O
non-Crohn O
s O
friends O
and O
they O
have O
certain O
things O
they O
can O
not O
eat O
at O
all O
or O
in O

I O
figured O
it O
out O
mostly O
by O
thinking O
about O
the O
future O
. O
I O
asked O
myself O
if O
I O
could O
handle O
these O
problems O
and O
this O
relationship O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
and O
the O
answer O
was O
no O
. O
Then O
I O
also O
thought O
about O
if O
the O
problems O
were O
because O
of O
the O
person O
being O
themselves O
or O
because O
of O
outside O
factors O
and O
most O
of O
our O
problems O
were O
the O
former O
. O

For O
the O
dryness B-DIS
-- O
try O
using O
a O
bit O
of O
lube O
for O
a O
quick O
fix O
just O
to O
stop O
the O
chaffing B-DIS
, O
also O
if O
you O
have O
a O
Walgreens O
, O
they O
have O
vaginal B-DRUG
moisturizers I-DRUG
there O
. O
As O
for O
the O
lump B-DIS
-- O
uncomfortable B-DIS
as O
in O
painful B-DIS
, O
or O
uncomfortable O
as O
in O
you O
don O
t O
know O
what O
it O
is O
and O
you O
don O
t O
like O
it O
If O
it O
s O
painful O
, O
then O
ignore O
me O
. O
But O
I O
have O
lumps B-DIS
like O
that O
as O
well O
on O
the O
top O
of O
my O
labia O
majora O
that O
I O
can O
slide O
around O
-- O
I O
ve O
always O
figured O
they O
were O
just O
fatty O
tissues O
. O
Is O
the O
bump O

this O
area O
with O
the O
red O

- O
just O
an O

but O
still O

I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
am O
ready O
for O
that O

This O
disease O
almost O
cost O
me O
my O
job O
. O
I O
was O
being O
sent O
home O
on O
regular O
occasions O
due O
to O
falling B-DIS
or O
not B-DIS
being I-DIS
able I-DIS
to I-DIS
stand I-DIS
. O
They O
understood O
my O
situation O
but O
after O
a O
while O
it O
got O
a O
but O
too O
much O
. O
Since O
taking O
the O
CBD B-DRUG
I O
ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
back O
on O
top O
at O

I O
m O
back O
firing O

all O

I O
can O
concentrate O
and O
have O
the O
energy O
to O
carry O
out O
my O
duties O
. O
It O
s O
still O
there O
but O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
at O
most O
I O
m O
experiencing O
a O
fraction O
which O
I O
m O
more O
than O
happy O
to O
cope O
with O
. O
I O
hope O
it O
serves O
you O
well O
. O
Let O
me O
know O
how O
you O
get O
on O
it O
be O
interesting O
to O

My O
current O
belief O
is O
that O
an O
accumulation O
of O
simultaneous O
stress B-DIS
from O
numerous O
sources O
environmental O
, O
dietary O
, O
viral O
, O
etc O
. O
will O
increase O
the O
odds O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
going O
feral B-DIS
or O
hyperactive B-DIS
, O
leading O
to O
a O
multiplicity O
of O
potential O
conditions O
such O
as O
burn-out B-DIS
, O
CFS B-DIS
or O
MS B-DIS
for O

A O

useless O

Snake B-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
and O
Parkinson O
s O
are O
found O
together O
far O
too O
often O
. O

One O
person O
I O
knew O
who O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
BPD B-DIS
only O
said O
topomax B-DRUG
helped O
them O
. O
Apparently O
there O
was O
a O
theory O
out O
there O
that O
BPD B-DIS
involved O
brain B-DIS
seizures I-DIS
in O
a O
different O
part O
of O
the O
brain O
than O
the O
typical O
seizures B-DIS
. O
Also O
BPD B-DIS
seems O
to O
be O
a O
combination O
of O
biological O
and O
behavioral O
components O
. O
So O
while O
medications O
might O
not O
be O
effective O
for O
some O
, O
I O
wouldn O
t O
outright O
dismiss O
them O
either O
. O
Nothing O
is O
really O
that O
well O
understood O
at O
this O
point O
, O
new O
data O
keeps O
coming O
in O
. O
Either O
way O
, O
whether O
the O
individual O
is O
diagnosed O
with O
comorbid B-DIS
disorders I-DIS
or O
not O
, O
I O
think O
medication O
is O
still O
something O
to O
consider O
as O
an O
option O
. O

If O
you O
know O
for O
sure O
hot O
water O
is O
a O
no-no O
, O
then O
they O
must O
have O
provided O
you O
with O
cleaning O
instructions O
, O
right O
If O
this O
is O
a O
hard O
plastic O
piece O
, O
you O
should O
buy O
some O
denture O
bubbling O
cleaning O
tablets O
. O
You O
drop O
the O
piece O
into O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
with O
the O
bubbling O
tablets O
. O
If O
it O
s O
a O
more O
pliable O
or O
rubbery O
type O
material O
, O
I O
d O
wash O
it O
with O
a O
toothbrush O
, O
just O
as O
if O
it O
were O
your O
teeth O

Ironically O
im O
setting O
up O
sinus O
work O
too O
. O
I O
saw O
an O
ENT O
3 O
years O
ago O
due O
to O
eye B-DIS
pain I-DIS
with O
no O
actual O
eye O
issues O
, O
cleared O
by O
eye O
doctor O
and O
sinus B-DIS
issues I-DIS
related O
to O
flying O
and O
was O
told O
I O
have O
multiple O
issues O
that O
needed O
to O
be O
addressed O
, O
including O
polyps B-DIS
and O
a O
deviated B-DIS
septum I-DIS
. O
I O
never O
got O
the O
surgery O
, O
but O
I O
am O
seeing O
that O
Doc O
again O
next O
week O
to O
start O
things O
over O
. O
Due O
to O
sinus B-DIS
issues I-DIS
, O
I O
need O
a O
full O
face O
mask O
. O
I O
am O
thinking O
a O
trying O
a O
Quattro B-DRUG
FX I-DRUG
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
well O
received O
and O
its O
smaller O
should O
be O
easier O
to O
adapt O
to O
. O
I O
also O
have O
sensitive B-DIS
skin I-DIS
, O
so O
hopefully O
it O
works O
. O
I O
may O
need O
to O
go O
to O
a O
cloth O
mask O
though O
. O

I O
would O
try O
posting O
in O
the O
chronic B-DIS
pain I-DIS
sub O
to O
hit O
a O
wider O
audience O
. O
Sorry O
I O
don O
t O
know O
much O
about O
it O
. O
I O
only O
know O
that O
it O
s O
not O
uncommon O
for O
people O
to O
apply O
several O
times O
before O
getting O
approved O
. O
Maybe O
look O
into O
getting O
a O
lawyer O
if O
your O

can O
help O
you O
with O

Changes O
in O
IBS B-DIS
are O
gradual O

If O
you O
are O

you O
need O
to O

I O
was O
out O

Now O
my O
husband O

I O
are O
getting O

I O
bought O
a O

off I-DIS
