so O
that O
s O
when O
I O
had O
the O
MRI O
and O
then O
told O
that O
it O
was O
menieres B-DIS
which O
I O
knew O
anyway O
. O
some O
sounds O
are O
muffled O
but O
some O
are O
so O
loud O
. O
my O
attacks O
are O
just O
all O
over O
the O
place O
now O
and O
will O
be O
different O
each O
time O
. O
so O
I O
d O
say O
there O
s O
always O
a O
chance O
of O
the O
attacks O
coming O
back O
but O
maybe O
the O
things O
you O
have O
done O
to O
control O
it O
have O
helped O
and O
are O
the O
reason O
you O
haven O
t O
had O
one O
for O
a O
while O
so O
keep O
doing O
what O
you O
 
do O
but O
always O
be O
prepared O
. O
I O
usually O
notice O
a O
increase B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
tinnitus I-DIS
and O
stuffy B-DIS
ears I-DIS
before O
I O
have O
a O
attack O
so O
sometimes O
I O
m O
prepared O
, O
just O
not O
every O
time O
 
Did O
it O
help O
your O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
at O
all O
 
They O
won O
t O
give O
me O
a O
count O
, O
spooky O
shit O
. O
They O
just O
say O
they O
need O
to O
stop O
it O
. O
 
Plaquenil B-DRUG
and O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O
Just O
recently O
switched O
to O
a O
new O
rheumatologist O
because O
I O
felt O
like O
my O
old O
one O
wasn O
t O
taking O
me O
seriously O
. O
Even O
though O
my O
tests O
all O
came O
back O
negative O
xray O
, O
ultrasound O
, O
bloodwork O
, O
my O
new O
doctor O
felt O
inflammation B-DIS
in I-DIS
some I-DIS
of I-DIS
my I-DIS
joints I-DIS
and O
believed O
me O
when O
I O
described O
symptoms O
, O
and O
he O
started O
me O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O
The O
old O
doc O
really O
sucked O
. O
If O
it O
weren O
t O
for O
my O
family O
doctor O
giving O
me O
tramacet B-DRUG
tramadol O
acetaminophen B-DRUG
, O
I O
don O
t O
know O
what O
I O
would O
have O
done O
. O
There O
would O
have O
been O
a O
lot O
of O
days O
that O
I O
wouldn O
t O
have O
been O
able O
to O
function O
enough O
to O
go O
to O
work O
. O
 
This O
is O
the O
most O
amazing O
thing O
I O
have O
read O
. O
Perfect O
description O
. O
 
I O
have O
a O
7 O
year O
old O
son O
with O
psoriasis B-DIS
, O
diagnosed O
at O
5 O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
what O
in O
the O
cetaphil B-DRUG
could O
be O
irritating B-DIS
him O
but O
I O
d O
suggest O
layering O
coconut O
oil O
and O
then O
a O
different O
moisturizer O
. O
My O
toddler O
son O
s O
eczema B-DIS
responds O
very O
well O
to O
Eucerin B-DRUG
baby I-DRUG
eczema B-DIS
cream I-DRUG
and O
it O
s O
nice O
amp O
; O
thick O
. O
 
Thank O
you O
, O
I O
ll O
bring O
this O
up O
to O
my O
doctor O
ASAP O
. O
I O
have O
some O
symptoms O
but O
I O
don O
t O
want O
to O
self O
diagnose O
 
Well O
, O
now O
that O
you O
memtion O
this O
. O
In O
the O
past O
6 O
months O
or O
so O
, O
ive O
had O
frequent O
loose B-DIS
stools I-DIS
my O
apnea B-DIS
had O
gotten O
worse O
Ive O
been O
on O
cpap O
for O
about O
1.5 O
weeks O
and O
that O
problem O
has O
disappeared O
. O
I O
guess O
they O
could O
be O
related O
. O
Although O
i O
never O
said O
anything O
to O
the O
sleep O
doc O
. O
 
A O
few O
banana O
can O
t O
hurt O
unless O
you O
don O
t O
like O
them O
. O
You O
could O
take O
a O
supplement O
but O
a O
food O
source O
has O
the O
added O
benefits O
of O
other O
healthful O
chemicals O
a O
multivitamin B-DRUG
supplement I-DRUG
won O
t O
have O
. O
Adjusting O
to O
a O
new O
sleep O
schedule O
can O
take O
some O
time O
, O
you O
may O
take O
a O
few O
weeks O
to O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O
I O
have O
been O
working O
7pm O
to O
5am O
for O
nearly O
a O
month O
and O
now O
I O
m O
just O
working O
7pm-3am O
so O
I O
m O
having O
to O
get O
used O
to O
going O
to O
sleep O
at O
4am O
and O
being O
up O
two O
hours O
earlier O
than O
normal O
. O
 
Surgery O
has O
no O
guarantees O
and O
once O
you O
cut O
into O
your O
body O
, O
there O
s O
no O
coming O
back O
. O
You O
can O
t O
undo O
surgery O
, O
you O
ll O
make O
scar B-DIS
tissue I-DIS
, O
and O
from O
what O
I O
ve O
read O
, O
recovery O
is O
a O
bitch O
. O
And O
you O
could O
still O
need O
cpap O
once O
it O
s O
all O
said O
and O
done O
haha O
. O
The O
insurance O
will O
look O
at O
your O
compliance O
data O
and O
AHI O
with O
cpap O
and O
it O
sounds O
like O
it O
s O
working O
well O
for O
you O
. O
So O
without O
hard O
evidence O
to O
back O
up O
why O
the O
surgery O
is O
a O
medical O
necessity O
, O
at O
minimum O
I O
anticipate O
your O
health O
insurance O
will O
not O
pay O
. O
it O
s O
embarrassing O
when O
I O
have O
guests O
over O
doesn O
t O
matter O
to O
the O
insurance O
company O
, O
although O
I O
totally O
feel O
you O
on O
that O
. O
I O
d O
also O
hope O
no O
surgeon O
would O
operate O
when O
a O
noninvasive O
measure O
is O
working O
so O
well O
. O
I O
m O
24 O
so O
I O
really O
get O
where O
you O
re O
coming O
from O
and O
I O
don O
t O
have O
any O
great O
solutions O
for O
you O
, O
I O
m O
not O
dating O
right O
now O
. O
But O
I O
ve O
definitely O
been O
thinking O
about O
how O
it O
ll O
all O
work O
out O
. O
But O
I O
don O
t O
think O
the O
potential O
embarrassment O
is O
worth O
letting O
someone O
cut O
open O
your O
face O
. O
I O
just O
recovered O
from O
abdominal B-DIS
surgery I-DIS
which O
was O
30 O
mins O
outpatient O
with O
one O
port O
into O
my O
stomach O
. O
Low O
hanging O
fruit O
as O
far O
as O
surgery O
goes O
. O
I O
m O
a O
month O
out O
and O
I O
d O
say O
I O
m O
back O
about O
to O
100 O
again O
. O
I O
honestly O
can O
t O
imagine O
the O
recovery O
from O
cranial O
surgery O
. O
 
Yes O
. O
It O
was O
very O
bad O
as O
a O
kid O
. O
It O
has O
gotten O
50 O
better O
due O
to O
better O
understanding O
the O
interplay O
of O
stress B-DIS
, O
nutrition O
, O
sleep O
, O
and O
medications O
. O
 
Do O
you O
have O
any O
trouble O
with O
it O
popping O
off O
your O
head O
during O
the O
night O
 
Thank O
you O
. O
Calling O
my O
Dr. O
today O
 
I O
use O
the O
shampoo O
, O
and O
when O
it O
was O
worse O
, O
I O
got O
this O
stuff O
called O
MG217 B-DRUG
, O
which O
seemed O
to O
help O
, O
but O
I O
think O
reducing O
my O
simple O
sugar O
intake O
may O
be O
helping O
too O
. O
 
You O
can O
find O
a O
kitchen O
strainer O
that O
will O
work O
. O
Just O
get O
one O
with O
as O
fine O
a O
mesh O
as O
you O
can O
find O
. O
Not O
surprisingly O
you O
can O
order O
a O
real O
one O
off O
Amazon O
. O
I O
think O
they O
have O
everything O
Lol O
. O
Try O
this O
link O
If O
you O
pass O
it O
I O
d O
recommend O
a O
consultation O
with O
a O
nephrologist O
. O
The O
urologist O
specializes O
in O
surgically O
removing O
them O
while O
a O
nephrologist O
specializes O
in O
preventing O
them O
. O
There O
s O
some O
overlap O
there O
but O
my O
urologist O
was O
more O
concerned O
with O
shoving O
a O
tube O
up O
my O
penis O
than O
telling O
me O
how O
to O
stop O
getting O
them O
. O
I O
passed O
a O
3 O
and O
had O
a O
5 O
and O
2 O
still O
in O
there O
. O
It O
s O
been O
about O
10 O
months O
with O
no O
sign O
of O
the O
two O
stuck O
in O
there O
. O
If O
nothing O
happens O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
go O
in O
for O
another O
CT O
to O
see O
what O
s O
going O
on O
. O
And O
if O
you O
haven O
t O
already O
, O
check O
here O
for O
some O
really O
great O
info O
on O
stones B-DIS
and O
their O
prevention O
. O
 
I O
m O
in O
the O
UK O
and O
we O
have O
different O
names O
for O
drugs O
. O
This O
link O
may O
be O
of O
interest O
in O
the O
US O
too O
. O
tl O
; O
dr O
I O
would O
infer O
that O
some O
headlines O
and O
articles O
overstate O
the O
impact O
. O
 
Swimming O
in O
the O
ocean O
and O
or O
taking O
epsom O
salt O
baths O
, O
getting O
as O
much O
sun O
as O
safely O
possible O
, O
staying O
hydrated O
, O
avoiding O
shitty O
food O
. O
Those O
always O
helped O
me O
when O
I O
didn O
t O
have O
any O
prescription O
treatments O
. O
There O
are O
also O
some O
over O
the O
counter O
remedies O
available O
but O
I O
personally O
have O
never O
tried O
them O
. O
 
I O
ve O
had O
two O
MRIs O
with O
contrast O
and O
had O
no O
reaction O
at O
all O
; O
I O
barely O
felt O
the O
needle O
going O
in O
It O
s O
a O
different O
material O
than O
what O
is O
used O
for O
CT O
scans O
so O
chances O
are O
you O
ll O
do O
great O
. O
Good O
luck O
 
Actemra B-DRUG
has O
been O
a O
magic O
drug O
for O
me O
. O
I O
m O
in O
a O
complete O
clinical O
remission O
for O
three O
years O
now O
. O
I O
hope O
it O
never O
stops O
working O
 
gt O
; O
Does O
it O
usually O
take O
months O
for O
it O
to O
heal O
It O
s O
not O
a O
wound O
which O
heals O
per O
se O
- O
Hunner O
s O
lesions O
are O
, O
although O
they O
are O
a O
separate O
condition O
which O
can O
coexist O
with O
IC B-DIS
. O
Usually O
they O
require O
cautery O
. O
Glomerulations B-DIS
can O
get O
better O
and O
worse O
throughout O
the O
years O
, O
but O
again O
, O
there O
are O
periods O
of O
remission O
, O
but O
not O
a O
grand O
healing O
event O
. O
I O
have O
a O
massive O
problem O
with O
use O
of O
that O
word O
in O
regards O
to O
ongoing O
chronic O
conditions O
like O
IC O
, O
as O
IC O
is O
absolutely O
nothing O
like O
getting O
a O
scratch O
or O
broken O
bone O
. O
If O
your O
primary O
problem O
is O
a O
burning B-DIS
sensation I-DIS
, O
antacids B-DRUG
are O
your O
best O
bet O
- O
and O
unless O
you O
have O
a O
heart B-DIS
or I-DIS
kidney I-DIS
condition I-DIS
, O
are O
safe O
to O
use O
daily O
. O
They O
can O
be O
taken O
alongside O
Elmiron B-DRUG
. O
With O
the O
diet O
, O
it O
is O
simply O
a O
symptom O
control O
measure O
to O
avoid O
irritating O
your O
bladder O
and O
urethra O
. O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
sex O
, O
it O
is O
very O
individual O
and O
depends O
on O
your O
specific O
symptoms O
and O
duration O
amount O
of O
friction O
, O
individual O
anatomy O
etc O
. O
Not O
having O
sex O
won O
t O
impact O
your O
condition O
long-term O
, O
but O
of O
course O
, O
if O
you O
are O
in O
a O
flared O
state O
, O
penetrative O
sex O
may O
make O
your O
symptoms O
temporarily O
worse O
and O
probably O
would O
be O
prudent O
to O
avoid O
for O
that O
specific O
period O
. O
 
snoring B-DIS
, O
in O
and O
of O
itself O
, O
is O
bad O
for O
you O
, O
not O
to O
mention O
disturbing O
everybody O
around O
you O
. O
 
I O
purchased O
a O
mouth O
piece O
prior O
to O
me O
getting O
my O
CPAP O
. O
Every O
night O
it O
would O
wind O
up O
somewhere O
on O
my O
bed O
or O
floor O
. O
 
PML B-DIS
scares O
the O
shit O
out O
of O
me O
. O
Almost O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
not O
treat O
my O
MS B-DIS
 
Does O
it O
make O
a O
big O
difference O
when O
it O
is O
cold O
I O
ve O
seen O
some O
people O
say O
it O
hurts B-DIS
worse I-DIS
when I-DIS
it I-DIS
is I-DIS
straight I-DIS
from I-DIS
the I-DIS
fridge I-DIS
. O
I O
m O
hoping O
this O
helps O
with O
my O
joints O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
been O
able O
to O
see O
a O
rheumatologist O
, O
but O
the O
cracking B-DIS
, O
popping B-DIS
and I-DIS
pain I-DIS
for O
the O
last O
decade O
tell O
me O
I O
ve O
got O
something O
going O
on O
there O
. O
 
I O
hate O
super O
hot O
or O
cold B-DIS
water O
. O
Getting O
in O
a O
hot O
tub O
or O
the O
ocean O
makes O
me O
cringe O
and O
enter O
slowly O
. O
I O
love O
hot O
showers O
but O
have O
to O
acclimate O
first O
because O
my O
skin O
is O
so O
sensitive O
to O
hot O
cold O
. O
The O
PLUS O
side O
to O
all O
this O
Anything O
intimate O
with O
my O
partners O
is O
50x O
better O
. O
I O
love O
being O
touched O
, O
massaged O
, O
kissed O
, O
licked O
, O
bit O
, O
etc O
because O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
millions O
of O
tiny O
nerve O
endings O
for O
experiencing O
pleasure O
. O
In O
return O
, O
it O
makes O
me O
a O
better O
lover O
because O
I O
try O
to O
give O
my O
partner O
the O
same O
feeling O
they O
give O
me O
, O
with O
added O
attention O
. O
 
Keeping O
UARS O
not O
diagnosed O
yet O
, O
PSG O
ruled O
out O
OSA O
in O
mind O
, O
it O
makes O
sense O
because O
the O
body O
is O
experiencing O
stress O
and O
releasing O
cortisol O
during O
sleep O
, O
causing O
chronic B-DIS
inflammation I-DIS
. O
I O
feel O
so O
much O
more O
relaxed O
now O
, O
and O
my O
body O
moves O
smoothly O
-- O
I O
ve O
never O
liked O
dancing O
before O
, O
now O
I O
do O
- O
I O
stand O
upright O
without O
conscious O
effort O
and O
friends O
have O
noticed O
that O
my O
gait O
has O
become O
smoother O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
am O
walking O
on O
air O
suspension O
. O
The O
test O
drive O
came O
in O
a O
flash O
. O
I O
came O
into O
contact O
with O
some O
online O
RPSGTs O
, O
and O
I O
learned O
that O
apart O
from O
CPAP-induced O
central O
apnea O
generally O
a O
machine O
can O
do O
no O
harm O
to O
a O
healthy O
person O
. O
I O
found O
out O
that O
I O
could O
get O
a O
3 O
year O
old O
System O
One O
BiPAP O
Auto O
machine O
for O
a O
really O
good O
price O
275 O
euros O
so O
I O
jumped O
at O
the O
offer O
. O
I O
m O
a O
CS O
student O
so O
adjusting O
a O
CPAP O
machine O
is O
not O
beyond O
my O
capabilities O
. O
Initial O
results O
were O
extremely O
compelling O
... O
 
lock O
the O
cat O
up O
at O
night O
, O
or O
create O
a O
gate O
for O
a O
makeshift O
door O
ask O
yourself O
what O
is O
more O
important O
your O
sanity O
with O
sleep O
, O
or O
some O
cat O
 
I O
have O
a O
similar O
AHI B-DIS
and O
complex O
central O
and O
obstructive O
apnea O
. O
The O
complex B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
has O
resulted O
in O
a O
prolonged B-DIS
QT I-DIS
heart O
ahrythmia O
which O
absolutely O
WILL O
kill O
you O
in O
your O
sleep O
. O
I O
know O
it O
sucks O
, O
and O
I O
ve O
given O
up O
on O
my O
ASV B-DRUG
so O
many O
times O
, O
but O
the O
longer O
you O
let O
it O
go O
the O
more O
likely O
you O
may O
develop O
irreversible B-DIS
heart I-DIS
problems I-DIS
. O
Just O
don O
t O
give O
up O
. O
 
Any O
update O
My O
doctor O
can O
t O
do O
the O
surgery O
but O
is O
recommending O
it O

My O
doctor O
says O
my O
inconsistent B-DIS
fatigue I-DIS
symptoms O
don O
t O
seem O
to O
correspond O
to O
the O
scores O
. O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
that O
means O
and O
suspect O
he O
doesn O
t O
either O
. O
 
I O
looked O
and O
found O
this O
It O
s O
an O
interview O
with O
the O
first O
author O
of O
the O
article O
and O
a O
bit O
more O
user O
friendly O
to O
read O
. O
What O
I O
got O
from O
it O
is O
that O
having O
a O
diverse O
set O
of O
microbes O
in O
your O
gut O
is O
usually O
considered O
good O
and O
associated O
with O
longer O
digestion O
time O
. O
However O
, O
it O
can O
also O
lead O
to O
prolonged B-DIS
transit I-DIS
times I-DIS
constipation B-DIS
. O
Also O
, O
shorter O
digestion O
time O
might O
be O
due O
to O
renewing B-DIS
of I-DIS
mucus I-DIS
. O
It O
doesn O
t O
mention O
IBS B-DIS
in O
particular O
though O
. O
Not O
sure O
if O
I O
got O
all O
that O
right O
, O
feel O
free O
to O
correct O
me O
. O
 
Unfortunatly O
, O
not O
approved O
yet O
. O
Neuro O
is O
still O
building O
a O
case O
for O
me O
. O
Can O
wait O
to O
try O
it O
as O
I O
have O
autoantibodies O
to O
alpha O
beta O
and O
M O
receptors O
which O
are O
used O
by O
the O
auto O
nervous O
system O
 
Personally O
, O
I O
don O
t O
feel O
that O
I O
would O
join O
a O
clinical O
trial O
without O
exhausting O
my O
other O
, O
already O
approved O
options O
first O
. O
And O
I O
literally O
have O
done O
medical O
research O
and O
am O
a O
huge O
proponent O
of O
it O
. O
If O
he O
hasn O
t O
tried O
Mtx B-DRUG
otzela B-DRUG
biologics B-DRUG
aka O
the O
standard O
treatments O
, O
I O
would O
probably O
try O
those O
first O
. O
If O
his O
doctor O
is O
being O
pushy O
about O
new O
trials O
, O
maybe O
consider O
a O
second O
opinion O
. O
 
It O
s O
nice O
that O
there O
s O
something O
for O
children O
actually O
. O
I O
think O
it O
s O
mostly O
misunderstood O
at O
a O
young O
age.. O
As O
for O
any O
illness O
I O
guess O
 
Well O
I O
dont O
know O
if O
I O
have O
any O
great O
advice O
. O
I O
was O
with O
my O
ex O
husband O
for O
9 O
years O
and O
was O
diagnosed O
2 O
years O
after O
we O
were O
married O
... O
it O
didn O
t O
work O
out O
between O
us O
and O
I O
have O
been O
on O
the O
endless O
dating O
cycle O
for O
5 O
years O
... O
single O
mom O
with O
MS B-DIS
and O
a O
bag O
of O
other O
health O
problems O
who O
can O
t O
work O
full O
time O
... O
doesn O
t O
bode O
well O
with O
most O
folks O
... O
I O
m O
also O
not O
the O
type O
to O
throw O
the O
MS B-DIS
diagnosis O
out O
there O
right O
out O
the O
gate O
but O
at O
the O
same O
time O
I O
try O
to O
let O
them O
know O
early O
because O
it O
might O
not O
be O
their O
choice O
to O
sign O
up O
for O
that O
... O
more O
so O
now O
I O
just O
try O
to O
live O
my O
own O
life O
... O
got O
too O
many O
things O
to O
deal O
with O
sometimes O
than O
trying O
to O
find O
a O
weird O
messed O
up O
not O
so O
fairy- O
fairy O
tale O
 
I O
had O
DATscan O
about O
2 O
years O
after O
first O
seeing O
a O
neurologist O
here O
in O
the O
UK O
. O
They O
let O
me O
outside O
while O
the O
tracer B-DRUG
made O
its O
way O
into O
my O
brain O
. O
It O
was O
Christmas O
Eve O
and O
I O
was O
advised O
to O
avoid O
hugging O
pregnant O
women O
and O
children O
, O
being O
slightly O
radioactive O
. O
The O
scan O
was O
a O
non-event O
, O
but O
I O
had O
plenty O
practice O
when O
I O
had O
cancer B-DIS
30 O
years O
ago O
. O
I O
got O
a O
CD O
of O
the O
results O
for O
10 O
which O
was O
cool O
, O
the O
absence O
off O
the O
butterfly O
shape O
shown O
by O
healthy O
people O
is O
noticeable O
. O
 
According O
to O
the O
medication O
guidelines O
for O
Cymbalta B-DRUG
, O
it O
can O
take O
up O
to O
4 O
weeks O
for O
it O
to O
build O
up O
in O
your O
system O
enough O
to O
have O
an O
effect O
, O
and O
stopping O
suddenly O
can O
cause O
a O
negative O
reaction O
. O
 
You O
and O
I O
are O
pretty O
much O
identical O
only O
I O
m O
on O
Medicaid O
, O
but O
will O
lose O
it O
also O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
this O
disease O
for O
16 O
fn O
years O
, O
I O
m O
27 O
years O
old O
. O
Also O
have O
an O
array O
of O
other O
medical O
issues O
, O
including O
fibro B-DIS
, O
finally O
starting O
to O
look O
up O
for O
me O
too O
, O
and O
bam O
. O
Yeah O
I O
m O
flipping O
out O
too O
... O
. O
 
Ugh O
I O
have O
finals O

My O
go O
to O
meal O
is O
preservative O
free O
bread O
and O
pita O

It O

all O

but O
my O
bladder O
won O
t O
be O
angry O
. O
 
Yup O
, O
and O
you O
never O
wan O
na O
be O
that O
person O
who O
is O
constantly O
saying O
I O
can O
t O
have O
____ O
because O
who O
wants O
to O
be O
around O
a O
negative O
Nancy O
Can O
t O
win O
I O
feel O
ya O
 
This O
was O
a O
nurse O
not O
an O
RN O
who O
the O
rep O
was O
bothering O
. O
She O
couldn O
t O
prescribe O
anything O
. O
 
My O
derm O
actually O
recommended O
DHS B-DRUG
but O
I O
was O
reluctant O
since O
I O
thought O
all O
tar O
shampoos O
stunk O
. O
Thanks O
 
Thanks O
for O
the O
input O
, O
it O
s O
good O
to O
hear O
other O
stories O
like O
this O
to O
help O
me O
towards O
finding O
the O
right O
medication O
s O
and O
dosage O
. O
How O
long O
have O
you O
been O
on O
the O
T4 B-DRUG
only O
Do O
you O
feel O
just O
as O
good O
on O
T4 B-DRUG
only O
at O
75 O
mcg O
as O
you O
did O
on O
T4 O
T3 B-DRUG
Because O
I O
really O
love O
the O
energy O
boost O
of O
the O
T3 B-DRUG
. O
I O
literally O
feel O
10 O
years O
younger O
on O
the O
NDT B-DRUG
, O
but O
the O
tinnitus B-DIS
is O
obviously O
extremely O
uncomfortable O
. O
 
I O
had O
an O
infection B-DIS
, O
it O
blew O
up O
, O
like O
puss B-DIS
welts I-DIS
on O
my O
back O
, O
I O
went O
in O
the O
hospital O
for O
10 O
years O
. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
afib B-DIS
after O
that O
. O
I O
do O
not O
use O
biologics B-DRUG
ever O
again O
. O
I O
moved O
from O
Virginia O
to O
Louisiana O
and O
my O
skin O
is O
much O
much O
better O
, O
but O
my O
social O
life O
is O
awful O
here O
. O
 
My O
current O
doc O
is O
reluctant O
because O
of O
my O
age O
and O
lack O
of O
test O
results O
unfortunately O
. O
It O
helps O
the O
pain B-DIS
for O
sure O
, O
but O
I O
have O
some O
knowledge O
of O
the O
disease O
because O
my O
mom O
has O
been O
through O
the O
wringer O
with O
it O
I O
think O
she O
s O
currently O
on O
Enbrel B-DRUG
and O
it O
helps O
a O
lot O
 
170 O
mcg O
, O
i O
strongly O
believe O
its O
an O
adrenal B-DIS
issue I-DIS
. O
My O
cortisol B-DIS
level I-DIS
was I-DIS
low I-DIS
in O
my O
May O
2016 O
test O
. O
 
Sorry O
I O
didn O
t O
respond O
sooner O
. O
I O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
focusing O
on O
that O
medical O
mess O
. O
We O
actually O
found O
out O
it O
was O
Topamax B-DRUG
. O
I O
didn O
t O
relate O
it O
to O
that O
because O
the O
flare B-DIS
started O
before O
I O
started O
the O
medication O
, O
but O
increased O
tenfold O
when O
I O
was O
put O
on O
Topamax B-DRUG
. O
I O
have O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
gastroenterologist O
soon O
and O
we O
re O
going O
to O
work O
with O
him O
and O
my O
neurologist O
together O
to O
see O
if O
we O
can O
find O
a O
harmony O
for O
both O
of O
them O
, O
because O
unfortunately O
I O
am O
stl O
incredibly O
symptomatic O
. O
Thank O
you O
so O
much O
though O
 
You O
haven O
t O
been O
recommended O
a O
diet O
, O
because O
if O
avoiding O
certain O
foods O
helps O
you O
, O
the O
doctors O
, O
pharmacists O
and O
big O
pharma O
don O
t O
make O
money O
. O
Try O
keto O
. O
At O
the O
very O
least O
, O
stop O
ingesting O
sugar O
. O
I O
ve O
suffered O
from O
RA B-DIS
most O
of O
my O
life O
. O
I O
stopped O
eating O
sugar O
in O
February O
. O
I O
ve O
never O
felt O
better O
. O
Eat O
food O
that O
are O
primarily O
from O
the O
earth O
, O
not O
manufactured O
. O
You O
might O
find O
amazing O
relief O
. O
 
what O
do O
u O
mean O
 
gt O
; O
My O
sleep O
specialist O
told O
me O
people O
have O
different O
symptoms O
and O
he O
s O
seen O
people O
with O
AHIs B-DIS
of O
over O
100 O
be O
fine O
during O
the O
day O
and O
people O
with O
low O
AHIs O
falling O
asleep O
during O
the O
day O
. O
That O
s O
really O
useful O
to O
know O
 
I O
love O
my O
RSB O
gym O
. O
Literally O
gave O
ne O
something O
to O
live O
for O
post O
diagnosis O
 
If O
its O
working O
why O
would O
you O
stop O
It O
doesnt O
stop O
you O
from O
producing O
a-TNF O
it O
just O
binds O
it O
up O
so O
it O
cant O
attack O
you O
. O
Its O
still O
there O
. O
It O
worked O
well O
for O
a O
year O
until O
I O
reacted O
to O
it O
, O
and O
then O
I O
had O
to O
stop O
. O
I O
would O
have O
stayed O
on O
it O
longer O
if O
I O
could O
. O
 
Don O
t O
listen O
to O
this O
malnutrition O
guy O
. O
Your O
body O
is O
fine O
and O
you O
are O
not O
running O
out O
of O
vitamins O
. O
I O
wouldn O
t O
start O
taking O
anything O
that O
your O
doctor O
doesn O
t O
know O
about O
right O
now O
. O
Magnesium B-DRUG
can O
worsen O
your O
diarrhea B-DIS
and O
b-vitamins B-DRUG
can O
make O
you O
feel B-DIS
hyper I-DIS
. O
B-vitamins B-DRUG
can O
also O
cause O
difficulty B-DIS
breathing I-DIS
which O
is O
a O
side-effect O
of O
thyroid O
medication O
. O
I O
d O
highly O
recommend O
keeping O
everything O
simple O
now O
that O
you O
re O
already O
having O
problems O
. O
 
I O
went O
through O
all O
the O
neurological O
biz O
too O
, O
I O
think O
they O
are O
covering O
the O
bases O
. O
You O
might O
ask O
your O
GI O
doctor O
if O
you O
can O
get O
Domperidone B-DRUG
, O
I O
didn O
t O
realize O
just O
how O
exhausting O
the O
Reglan B-DRUG
and O
other O
drugs O
were O
until O
I O
switched O
It O
took O
a O
while O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
work O
well O
too O
. O
Also O
, O
I O
ve O
been O
telling O
any O
GPer O
who O
will O
listen O
to O
get O
on O
a O
really O
good O
diet O
. O
I O
m O
finally O
feeling O
better O
after O
4 O
years O
and O
I O
noticed O
a O
real O
difference O
from O
transitioning O
from O
hypoallergenic O
shakes O
to O
a O
plant O
based O
diet O
well O
cooked O
and O
using O
really O
good O
probiotics O
. O
 
We O
can O
t O
tell O
either O
. O
Usually O
the O
main O
symptom O
is O
severe B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
Over O
time O
the O
pain B-DIS
moves I-DIS
down I-DIS
the I-DIS
back I-DIS
from I-DIS
the I-DIS
kidney I-DIS
towards I-DIS
the I-DIS
hip I-DIS
and O
then O
the O
pain B-DIS
is I-DIS
lower I-DIS
abdominal I-DIS
down I-DIS
into I-DIS
the I-DIS
groin I-DIS
. O
The O
pain B-DIS
can I-DIS
come I-DIS
and I-DIS
go I-DIS
, O
hence O
it O
s O
called O
renal B-DIS
colic I-DIS
. O
 
Limb B-DIS
pain I-DIS
was O
one O
of O
my O
most O
prevalent O
symptoms O
. O
It O
would O
get O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
had O
to O
sort O
of O
brace O
myself O
against O
the O
sensation O
when O
it O
was O
time O
to O
move O
. O
I O
still O
get O
limp B-DIS
pain I-DIS
and O
extreme B-DIS
fatigue I-DIS
when O
I O
m O
having O
flare B-DIS
ups I-DIS
, O
but O
it O
usually O
doesn O
t O
last O
more O
than O
a O
few O
days O
. O
 
No O
problem O
Hope O
you O
ll O
find O
what O
you O
re O
looking O
for O
 
Yes O
, O
the O
activity O
level O
is O
low O
. O
But O
I O
m O
hoping O
that O
some O
T2 B-DIS
posters O
, O
both O
new O
and O
old O
, O
will O
populate O
it O
. O
r O
diabetes B-DIS
is O
, O
overall O
, O
very O
hostile O
to O
T2 O
. O
I O
m O
not O
saying O
everyone O
, O
but O
every O
T2 O
post O
gets O
downvoted O
. O
It O
s O
already O
a O
much O
maligned O
disease O
; O
atitudes O
in O
this O
sub O
don O
t O
help O
. O
 
Hypoparathyroidism B-DIS
and O
CFS B-DIS
are O
completely O
different O
things O
. O
The O
study O
you O
linked O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
was O
causing O
your O
symptoms O
. O
 
Btw O
how O
old O
were O
you O
when O
symtoms O
started O
 
Maybe O
telling O
him O
it O
is O
not O
his O
and O
you O
ll O
get O
him O
something O
else O
 
I O
think O
it O
s O
a O
bit O
more O
complicated O
. O
One O
thing O
not O
mentioned O
about O
the O
difficulties O
in O
undertaking O
ME B-DIS
research O
is O
that O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
issue O
of O
funding O
, O
then O
there O
s O
the O
issue O
of O
what O
you O
can O
reasonably O
receive O
IRB O
approval O
for O
. O
I O
ve O
long O
heard O
that O
it O
s O
such O
a O
controversial O
area O
that O
institutions O
grew O
to O
not O
want O
to O
be O
involved O
, O
period O
, O
leading O
to O
approval O
being O
extremely O
difficult O
, O
if O
not O
impossible O
, O
to O
win O
. O
Add O
to O
that O
the O
issues O
involved O
with O
biopsy-ing O
tissue O
... O
remember O
Ian O
Lipkin O
refused O
to O
even O
consider O
such O
research O
Even O
if O
he O
wasn O
t O
, O
it O
doesn O
t O
surprise O
me O
that O
decision-makers O
would O
be O
down O
on O
something O
invasive O
like O
that O
-- O
they O
re O
repeatedly O
being O
told O
how O
horrible O
this O
disease O
is O
, O
and O
then O
someone O
wants O
to O
put O
these O
patients O
through O
something O
like O
that O
If O
there O
was O
an O
easier O
path O
I O
suspect O
there O
d O
be O
more O
researchers O
involved O
, O
much O
like O
there O
d O
be O
more O
on O
board O
if O
medical O
science O
hadn O
t O
all O
but O
shut O
us O
out O
over O
the O
years O
anyway O
. O
I O
do O
think O
that O
the O
enterovirus B-DIS
theory O
is O
still O
fairly O
well-regarded O
, O
but O
going O
on O
a O
virus B-DIS
hunt O
is O
not O
something O
that O
many O
have O
wanted O
to O
commit O
funding O
to O
since O
the O
Science O
paper O
went O
down O
. O
 
No O
, O
I O
have O
a O
better O
idea O
, O
ask O
the O
internet O
 
That O
s O
okay O
, O
you O
got O
something O
done O
 
It O
makes O
me O
have O
more O
syncope B-DIS
presyncope B-DIS
episodes I-DIS
in O
the O
morning O
when O
I O
wake O
up O
and O
it O
hasn O
t O
worn O
off O
yet O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
feel O
like O
it O
would O
take O
me O
much O
less O
time O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
become O
functional O
if O
I O
didn O
t O
take O
it O
. O
But O
its O
also O
the O
only O
reason O
I O
can O
sleep O
at O
night O
. O
 
From O
my O
understanding O
, O
a O
major B-DIS
personality I-DIS
shift I-DIS
can O
be O
a O
pretty O
big O
sign O
. O
Leading O
into O
my O
mum O
s O
formal O
diagnosis O
, O
before O
the O
forgetfulness B-DIS
and O
confusion B-DIS
, O
she O
started O
being O
extremely B-DIS
angry I-DIS
, O
which O
was O
completely O
unlike O
her O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
the O
best O
, O
and O
hope O
it O
isn O
t O
the O
worst O
. O
 
I O
m O
not O
a O
doc O
or O
anything O
, O
but O
given O
that O
you O
ve O
had O
CFS B-DIS
for O
9.5 O
years O
and O
nausea B-DIS
for O
the O
last O
five O
months O
, O
I O
d O
be O
inclined O
to O
think O
of O
the O
nausea B-DIS
as O
most O
likely O
an O
unrelated O
issue O
. O
I O
found O
this O
, O
which O
is O
a O
bit O
dense O
and O
hard O
to O
read O
, O
but O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
pretty O
thorough O
 
One O
of O
the O
warning O
signs O
of O
PEM B-DIS
for O
me O
is O
creeping B-DIS
depression I-DIS
, O
with O
an O
inability B-DIS
to I-DIS
form I-DIS
positive I-DIS
thoughts I-DIS
. O
I O
get O
the O
other O
symptoms O
as O
well O
, O
but O
that O
s O
one O
of O
the O
main O
ways O
I O
recognize O
it O
. O
 
Surgery O
can O
be O
difficult O
to O
embrace O
because O
it O
s O
permanent O
but O
keep O
in O
mind O
that O
it O
is O
an O
avenue O
of O
treatment O
all O
the O
same O
. O
My O
first O
surgery O
when O
I O
was O
nine O
bought O
me O
more O
than O
10 O
years O
free O
of O
major O
issues O
and O
I O
will O
always O
be O
thankful O
for O
it O
. O
If O
it O
s O
the O
same O
area O
causing O
all O
of O
the O
problems O
then O
you O
should O
absolutely O
have O
it O
removed O
, O
especially O
if O
it O
s O
only O
4 O
. O
Recovering O
from O
surgery O
is O
difficult O
, O
it O
may O
take O
you O
more O
time O
than O
they O
project O
or O
it O
may O
take O
less O
. O
Either O
way O
, O
don O
t O
push O
yourself O
so O
hard O
that O
you O
exacerbate O
your O
condition O
. O
Walk O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can O
tolerate O
after O
the O
surgery O
, O
it O
s O
painful O
but O
I O
assure O
you O
it O
helps O
. O
Also O
, O
take O
as O
little O
pain B-DRUG
medication I-DRUG
as O
you O
can O
tolerate O
. O
Don O
t O
make O
yourself O
miserable O
, O
but O
certain O
pain O
medications O
can O
slow O
healing O
. O
Good O
luck O
with O
the O
surgery O
, O
and O
congratulations O
on O
not O
having O
to O
have O
surgery O
until O
29 O
 
NO O
 
Dude O
I O
can O
t O
really O
say O
too O
much O
except O
that O
we O
seem O
to O
be O
nearing O
a O
point O
of O
the O
most O
hope O
the O
CFS B-DIS
community O
has O
ever O
had O
. O
Don O
t O
quit O
now O
It O
also O
sounds O
like O
you O
haven O
t O
been O
sick O
long O
. O
You O
might O
even O
recover O
from O
that O
normally O
without O
developing O
CFS B-DIS
. O
But O
regardless O
don O
t O
give O
in O
now O
. O
 
Yepyepeyep O
. O
That O
s O
why O
I O
posted O
here O
. O
I O
knew O
you O
all O
would O
understand O
. O
 
Not O
as O
far O
as O
we O
know O
, O
though O
I O
had O
considered O
that O
before O
talking O
to O
my O
mom O
Having O
food O
was O
never O
an O
issue O
in O
his O
home O
either O
as O
a O
child O
or O
an O
adult O
as O
far O
as O
we O
know O
. O
He O
s O
also O
picky O
weird O
, O
considering O
he O
ll O
happily O
eat O
expired O
stuff O
that O
he O
finds O
and O
will O
throw O
away O
most O
veggies O
and O
fruits O
when O
they O
re O
served O
to O
him O
, O
so O
that O
s O
difficult O
. O
 
man O
with O
BPD B-DIS
One O
thing O
commonly O
known O
or O
observed O
about O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
with O
BPD B-DIS
but O
not O
all O
, O
i O
don O
t O
generalize O
is O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
us O
didn O
t O
have O
a O
real O
, O
childhood O
experience O
. O
We O
didn O
t O
grow O
up O
in O
a O
safe O
unsafe O
ranging O
from O
terrible O
abuse O
to O
lowkey O
unacceptance O
environment O
for O
our O
true O
selves O
to O
be O
nurtured O
and O
bolstered O
. O
Because O
of O
that O
lack O
of O
safety O
, O
there O
s O
this O
constant O
anxiety B-DIS
present O
about O
expressing O
our O
real O
selves O
and O
a O
false B-DIS
self I-DIS
system I-DIS
develops O
to O
help O
protect O
us O
. O
There O
is O
more O
to O
BPD B-DIS
than O
that O
but O
that O
is O
one O
aspect O
of O
our O
condition O
that O
is O
talked O
about O
in O
the O
literature O
and O
in O
the O
therapy O
. O
One O
part O
of O
recovery O
or O
reinventing O
your O
life O
if O
you O
ve O
never O
had O
a O
stable O
period O
, O
is O
trying O
to O
replace O
what O
the O
trauma O
and O
or O
illness O
took O
from O
you O
. O
If O
you O
can O
t O
replace O
what O
that O
, O
then O
try O
to O
live O
around O
the O
pain B-DIS
in O
the O
best O
way O
you O
can O
. O
Do O
it O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
gentle O
, O
good O
, O
and O
healthy O
. O
Treat O
yourself O
like O
your O
own O
child O
. O
Do O
things O
you O
loved O
to O
do O
as O
a O
child O
and O
let O
yourself O
experience O
the O
pleasure O
of O
them O
as O
an O
adult O
. O
Try O
to O
set O
periods O
where O
you O
experience O
the O
world O
more O
simply O
instead O
of O
so O
complexly O
. O
It O
ll O
make O
things O
easier O
for O
you O
. O
 
That O
would O
be O
awesome O
, O
if O
it O
were O
legal O
in O
PA O
. O
Unfortunately O
, O
it O
s O
not O
worth O
the O
risk O
sole O
custodial O
mom O
. O
 
I O
just O
called O
every O
number O
they O
gave O
me O
and O
for O
answering O
machines O
for O
them O
all O
. O
More O
walls O
Hopefully O
I O
get O
some O
call O
backs O
on O
Monday O
. O
Ya O
there O
is O
a O
DBT O
self O
help O
website O
but O
I O
don O
t O
think O
it O
s O
something O
I O
m O
able O
to O
do.right O
now O
. O
I O
m O
extremely O
isolated O
and O
it O
s O
causing O
me O
to O
spiral O
downwards O
. O
I O
need O
to O
get O
into O
some O
groups O
or O
drop O
in O
centers O
or O
something O
. O
I O
m O
almost O
at O
4 O
months O
clean O
and O
sober O
and O
find O
my O
grasp O
on O
sobriety O
slipping O
quickly O
and O
don O
t O
think O
I O
can O
stop O
it O
unless O
I O
make O
some O
big O
changes O
fast O
stop O
isolating O
. O
 
I O
m O
monitoring O
now O
, O
but O
if O
I O
stick O
with O
the O
keto O
diet O
and O
my O
numbers O
remain O
as O
stable O
and O
low O
as O
they O
are O
, O
I O
imagine O
my O
doctor O
will O
remove O
my O
regular O
insulin B-DRUG
shots I-DRUG
, O
placing O
me O
on O
a O
nightly O
pill O
. O
Under O
such O
circumstances O
, O
I O
may O
check O
my O
insulin O
less O
frequently O
, O
thus O
*may* O
not O
catch O
my O
BG B-DIS
spiking I-DIS
. O
I O
recognize O
the O
signs O
now O
, O
though O
. O
I O
was O
under O
the O
impression O
the O
keto O
diet O
was O
only O
potentially O
dangerous O
for O
lows O
and O
not O
high O
BGs O
. O
Ugh O
, O
diabetes B-DIS
sucks O
. O
 
The O
hallucinations B-DIS
and O
paranoia B-DIS
, O
plus O
the O
up B-DIS
and I-DIS
down I-DIS
mental I-DIS
state I-DIS
makes O
me O
immediately O
think O
of O
Lewy B-DIS
Body I-DIS
Dementia I-DIS
. O
That O
s O
likely O
the O
kind O
a O
relative O
of O
mine O
had O
. O
I O
would O
caution O
you O
to O
get O
his O
general O
health O
checked O
out O
right O
away O
with O
the O
sudden B-DIS
decline I-DIS
. O
My O
relative O
went O
from O
, O
yeah O
maybe O
that O
s O
a O
touch O
of O
dementia B-DIS
to O
noticeable O
moderate O
stages O
of O
dementia B-DIS
in O
the O
matter O
of O
a O
couple O
days O
when O
they O
became O
very O
ill. O
Later O
, O
when O
they O
recovered O
it O
was O
back O
to O
mild B-DIS
dementia I-DIS
. O
In O
any O
case O
, O
co-occurring O
illnesses O
can O
really O
diminish O
someone O
s O
mental O
state O
. O
 
Dang O
there O
s O
no O
way O
I O
d O
let O
that O
happen O
. O
But O
since O
I O
m O
not O
you O
, O
if O
I O
were O
you O
then O
I O
d O
go O
to O
a O
walk-in O
clinic O
and O
get O
my O
TSH O
tested O
, O
which O
would O
be O
ridiculously O
high O
after O
3 O
weeks O
and O
any O
doctor O
would O
want O
to O
see O
that O
. O
then O
I O
d O
email O
that O
result O
to O
my O
PC O
to O
make O
him O
freak O
out O
and O
dedicate O
his O
life O
to O
my O
thyroid O
 
I O
have O
called O
the O
ambulance O
for O
her O
once O
before O
and O
that O
prompted O
her O
getting O
proper O
medical O
treatment O
via O
DBT O
and O
therapy O
. O
She O
often O
has O
suicidal B-DIS
thoughts I-DIS
and O
vocalises O
them O
but O
she O
has O
not O
self O
harmed O
whilst O
I O
have O
dated O
her O
. O
We O
ve O
never O
taken O
a O
break O
but O
we O
have O
not O
ever O
lived O
together O
and O
really O
only O
spend O
long O
periods O
together O
on O
weekends O
. O
In O
your O
case O
he O
is O
hurting O
you O
more O
buy O
being O
vague O
about O
your O
relationship O
status O
as O
obviously O
knowing O
for O
sure O
is O
important O
to O
you O
. O
The O
most O
important O
thing O
to O
note O
is O
that O
he O
is O
under O
a O
lot O
of O
pressure O
to O
provide O
emotional O
support O
for O
you O
whist O
curbing O
his O
own O
grievances O
for O
fear O
of O
upsetting O
you O
more O
. O
I O
think O
the O
best O
way O
to O
continue O
a O
relationship O
with O
him O
which O
may O
or O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
thing O
for O
you O
is O
to O
take O
your O
treatment O
seriously O
, O
dont O
miss O
a O
single O
DBT O
session O
and O
acknowledge O
that O
your O
illness O
is O
nobody O
s O
fault O
but O
that O
you O
understand O
the O
toll O
it O
took O
on O
him O
and O
propose O
a O
date O
in O
a O
few O
weeks O
after O
you O
ve O
started O
treatment O
. O
 
i O
ve O
been O
in O
a O
situation O
suuuper O
similar O
to O
that.. O
but O
this O
line O
really O
resonated O
with O
me O
*It O
s O
that O
I O
m O
stuck O
in O
this O
state O
of O
mind O
where O
I O
don O
t O
know O
how O
to O
be O
myself O
anymore O
. O
* O
and O
especially O
the O
end O
where O
you O
talk O
about O
just O
being O
a O
husk O
of O
the O
person O
you O
used O
to O
be O
. O
i O
ve O
been O
working O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
to O
fix O
this O
and O
become O
my O
old O
self O
again O
so O
i O
thought O
i O
d O
share O
some O
of O
what O
i O
ve O
learned O
i O
ve O
stuggled O
with O
depression B-DIS
just O
about O
my O
whole O
life O
but O
it O
s O
almost O
as O
though O
i O
deteriorated O
. O
i O
realized O
i O
had O
also O
adopted O
a O
horrible O
anxiety B-DIS
which O
only O
compounded O
the O
problem O
of O
course O
. O
so O
anyways O
, O
i O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
reflection O
and O
tried O
to O
figure O
where O
in O
my O
life O
i O
lost O
myself O
and O
became O
just O
a O
shell O
. O
it O
came O
back O
to O
my O
first O
year O
in O
college O
- O
i O
was O
really O
struggling O
with O
and O
my O
grades O
were O
absolute O
shit O
, O
and O
then O
a O
breakup O
just O
absolutely O
DESTROYED O
my O
confidence O
and O
i O
think O
that O
s O
when O
the O
anxiety B-DIS
kicked O
in O
of O
course O
i O
m O
already O
incredibly O
depressed B-DIS
and O
it O
was O
just O
a O
bad O
sprial.. O
. O
anyways O
, O
my O
mind O
looked O
at O
this O
break O
up O
as O
some O
horrible O
tragedy O
and O
as O
ridiculous O
as O
it O
sounds O
I O
almost O
see O
it O
as O
traumatic O
the O
way O
the O
whole O
thing O
went O
down O
. O
nowadays O
i O
still O
don O
t O
feel O
like O
my O
normal O
self O
, O
but O
being O
able O
to O
see O
where O
it O
stems O
from O
has O
helped O
tremendously O
in O
overcoming O
just O
the O
endless O
bullshit O
my O
head O
throws O
at O
me.. O
point O
is O
, O
i O
m O
not O
sure O
if O
there O
s O
some O
major O
or O
minor O
event O
that O
led O
to O
this O
or O
if O
just O
developed O
over O
time O
but O
 
it O
might O
be O
a O
decent O
place O
to O
start.. O
i O
also O
wan O
na O
suggest O
taking O
solo O
vacations O
if O
possible O
, O
even O
if O
only O
for O
a O
weekend O
. O
it O
s O
my O
way O
of O
escaping O
all O
things O
reality O
and O
just O
trying O
to O
enjoy O
myself O
or O
the O
things O
i O
like O
doing O
. O
it O
s O
incredibly O
healing O
and O
can O
lead O
to O
some O
very O
insightful O
reflections O
next O
blunt O
i O
light O
will O
be O
in O
honor O
of O
us O
becoming O
our O
former O
selves O
again.. O
lol O
. O
but O
anyways O
i O
hope O
this O
is O
some O
kind O
of O
decent O
starting O
point O
for O
you O
 
This O
is O
called O
an O
FP O
, O
or O
favorite O
person O
, O
which O
is O
colloquial O
for O
a O
regulator O
. O
It O
might O
help O
to O
look O
this O
up O
and O
see O
if O
any O
internet O
reaources O
can O
help O
you O
with O
managing O
your O
interpersonal O
relationships O
codependence O
. O
 
Social O
worker O
 
I O
can O
t O
relax O
, O
it O
s O
one O
of O
those O
days O
. O
My O
blood O
is O
up O
and O
I O
can O
t O
calm O
down O
, O
can O
t O
stop O
thinking O
about O
my O
whore O
of O
an O
ex O
. O
I O
really O
want O
to O
get O
back O
at O
her O
and O
who O
she O
tossed O
me O
aside O
for O
. O
Hatred O
and O
depression B-DIS
are O
all O
I O
have O
left O
. O
They O
comfort O
me O
when O
everyone O
else O
doesn O
t O
care O
. O
Which O
is O
all O
the O
time O
. O
I O
hate O
going O
places O
because O
I O
know O
I O
ll O
see O
people O
holding O
hands O
or O
sweet O
talking O
to O
each O
other O
and O
I O
just O
get O
so O
goddamm O
jealous O
. O
Why O
can O
they O
make O
a O
connection O
but O
I O
spend O
almost O
every O
waking O
moment O
trying O
to O
find O
love O
on O
the O
Internet O
and O
get O
shot O
down O
every O
single O
time O
Why O
do O
they O
get O
to O
have O
happiness O
and O
not O
me O
Sometimes O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
should O
steal O
their O
happiness O
somehow O
, O
but O
then O
I O
remember O
I O
m O
a O
coward O
and O
go O
back O
to O
hating O
myself O
. O
 
Wait O
so O
your O
like O
visiting O
Ahuntsic O
or O
something O
then O
I O
m O
so O
confused O
haha O
 
Congratulations O
, O
that O
s O
great O
to O

What O

of O

Before O

178lbs O
at O
my O

. O
I O
found O
a O
bmr O
calculator O
online O
which O
told O
me O
a O
rough O
estimate O
of O
how O
many O
calories O
I O
need O
to O
stick O
under O
in O
order O
to O
lose O
weight O
. O
I O
also O
had O
to O
cut O
back O
on O
quantities O
of O
what O
I O
ate O
. O
Thanks O

. O
 
My O
mom O
is O
in O
long O
term O
care O
with O
Alzheimer O
s. O
It O
took O
a O
long O
time O
for O
my O
dad O
to O
convince O
her O
to O
be O
assessed O
and O
a O
2nd O
geriatrician O
2 O
years O
later O
to O
get O
the O
diagnosis O
right O
. O
She O
has O
never O
acknowledged O
or O
realized O
that O
she O
has O
Alzheimer O
s. O
I O
echo O
the O
previous O
comment O
. O
Get O
power O
of O

asap O
. O
If O
your O
mom O
won O
t O
agree O
to O
see O
her O
doctor O
, O
maybe O
you O
can O
enlist O
one O
of O
her O
friends O
to O
help O
. O
Good O
luck O
 
I O
cry O
intellectually.. O
If O
that O
makes O
sense O
. O
Emotionally O
I O
have O
been O
very O
tough O
from O
d1 O
, O
cause O
I O
need O
to O
stay O
strong O
. O
 
I O
ve O
had O
my O
ileostomy B-DIS
for O
about O
5 O
years O
now O
, O
and O
although O
it O
didn O
t O
get O
rid O
of O
my O
Crohn O
s O
, O
I O
am O
really O
thankful O
to O
have O
it O
. O
Crohn O
s O
runs O
in O
my O
family O
- O
my O
dad O
got O
his O
ileostomy O
in O
the O
70 O
s O
, O
and O
he O
has O
been O
totally O
healthy O
and O
symptom O
free O
. O
One O
of O
my O
siblings O
also O
has O
it O
- O
ended O
up O
needing O
an O
emergency O
surgery O
for O
one O
in O
2009 O
and O
has O
been O
symptom O
free O
ever O
since O
. O
I O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
saw O
these O
success O
stories O
and O
elected O
to O
get O
mine O
- O
I O
had O
two O
resections O
in O
2010 O
2011 O
, O
wasn O
t O
responding O
to O
biologics O
and O
kept O
getting O
pesky B-DIS
infections I-DIS
abscesses B-DIS
, O
not O
to O
mention O
I O
spent O
that O
year O
of O
college O
knowing O
where O
ALL O
the O
private O
bathrooms O
were O
on O
campus O
*eek* O
. O
So O
at O
my O
crossroads O
I O
knew O
I O
needed O
surgery O
, O
but O
chose O
to O
go O
with O
a O
permanent O
ileostomy O
because O
I O
was O
tired O
of O
having O
surgeries O
and O
as O
some O
others O
have O
mentioned O
figured O
it O
would O
probably O
end O
up O
being O
permanent O
in O
the O
long O
run O
anyways O
. O
Although O
I O
still O
have O
active O
Crohn O
s O
, O
I O
can O
t O
tell O
you O
how O
great O
it O
feels O
to O
not O
have O
worry O
about O
finding O
a O
bathroom O
anymore O
. O
I O
would O
be O
lying O
to O
say O
that O
there O
weren O
t O
times O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
a O
normal O
bathroom O
life O
, O
but O
given O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
have O
Crohn O
s O
normal O
was O
never O
really O
an O
option O
anyways O
, O
and O
this O
has O
given O
me O
so O
much O
more O
freedom O
. O
Truly O
there O
s O
no O
reason O
for O
an O
ostomy O
to O
hold O
you O
back O
from O
anything O
in O
life O
as O
long O
as O
you O
don O
t O
hold O
yourself O
back O
from O
them O
There O
s O
a O
great O
website O
blog O
UncoverOstomy O
that O
you O
should O
check O
out O
if O
you O
want O
 
to O
hear O
some O
other O
people O
s O
stories O
. O
Although O
rare O
, O
having O
a O
stoma B-DIS
doesn O
t O
necessarily O
eliminate O
the O
possibility O
for O
developing O
fistula O
s O
or O
abscesses B-DIS
if O
you O
still O
have O
active O
disease O
, O
but O
it O
would O
probably O
change O
their O
location O
to O
the O
stoma O
area O
. O
I O
have O
had O
one O
myself O
... O
But O
if O
having O
the O
ileostomy O
saves O
you O
from O
some O
inflammation B-DIS
or I-DIS
strictures I-DIS
, O
then O
hopefully O
this O
wouldn O
t O
be O
a O
problem O
. O
Also O
, O
I O
agree O
that O
getting O
an O
ostomy O
for O
me O
was O
so O
much O
the O
fuck O
it O
stage O
of O
dealing O
with O
Crohn O
s. O
I O
was O
19 O
when O
I O
had O
the O
surgery O
, O
and O
I O
actually O
gained O
a O
lot O
of O
confidence O
and O
self O
assurance O
through O
the O
whole O
process O
because O
I O
realized O
that O
I O
m O
great O
, O
Crohn O
s O
sucks O
, O
and O
fuck O
it O
if O
I O
m O
going O
to O
let O
my O
ostomy O
hold O
me O
back O
from O
living O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O
at O
your O
crossroad O
 
So O
exciting O
Miracle O
drug O
if O
I O
do O
say O
so O
myself O
. O
Good O
luck O
 
This O
is O
great O
thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
reminding O
me O
. O
 
There O
is O
a O
theory O
that O
as O
your O
body O
- O
and O
your O
heart O
- O
are O
having O
to O
work O
harder O
as O
a O
result O
of O
your O
condition O
you O
are O
more O
prone O
to O
becoming O
fatigued O
. O
This O
can O
still O
be O
the O
case O
even O
if O
you O
don O
t O
feel O
severely O
symptomatic O
. O
 
THIS O
. O
IS O
. O
AMAZING O
. O
Were O
you O
around O
in O
2011 O
The O
site O
looks O
vaguely O
familiar O
to O
me O
, O
and O
that O
was O
when O
I O
was O
looking O
at O
ALL O
the O
assistive O
devices O
after O
my O
grandfathers O
stroke B-DIS
. O
Is O
it O
ok O
if O
I O
share O
this O
with O
a O
ton O
of O
people O
I O
used O
to O
work O
with O
seniors O
and O
I O
think O
all O
my O
colleagues O
would O
love O
it- O
we O
weren O
t O
in O
a O
position O
to O
buy O
this O
stuff O
for O
people O
, O
but O
it O
s O
good O
to O
know O
what O
s O
available O
so O
we O
can O
recommend O
things O
to O
families O
. O
 
I O
hear O
all O
you O
need O
is O
love O
. O
 
Wow O
, O
that O
s O
rough O
. O
The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
since O
there O
are O
Korean O
retirement O
homes O
in O
the O
area O
, O
there O
probably O
are O
elder O
care O
specialists O
. O
You O
can O
call O
, O
even O
if O
she O
won O
t. O
It O
won O
t O
hurt O
for O
you O
to O
gather O
information O
. O
I O
m O
impressed O
that O
she O
s O
going O
to O
swim O
class O
She O
sounds O
pretty O
active O
. O
I O
m O
not O
at O
all O
religious O
but O
always O
think O
of O
church O
as O
a O
way O
to O
get O
people O
more O
involved O
in O
their O
communities O
. O
It O
sounds O
as O
though O
she O
s O
socially O
engaged O
with O
family O
but O
apprehensive O
with O
strangers O
. O
Perhaps O
if O
a O
few O
ladies O
from O
church O
started O
dropping O
in O
to O
visit O
you O
could O
bridge O
the O
gap O
. O
 
Peeled O

I O
thought O

were O
symptoms O
of O
hyperthyroidism B-DIS

a O
sign O
you O
re O
taking O
too O

I O
dunno O
I O
m O
new O
my O
doc O
told O
me O
to O
look O
out O
for O
those O
symptoms O
as O
a O
sign O
I O
need O
my O
dosage O

no O

. O
I O
have O
had O
people O
act O
friendly O
and O
try O
to O
get O
to O
know O
me O
, O
but O
I O
just O
figure O
that O
s O
because O
they O
act O
like O
that O
with O
everyone O
and O
are O
just O
being O
nice O
because O
they O
mistakenly O
assume O
I O
m O
an O
ordinary O
human O
being O
. O
 
Thank O
you O
I O
appreciate O
the O

Even O
my O
husband O

who O
s O
totally O
supportive O
, O
saying O
he O
understands O
makes O
me O
want O
to O
yell O

No O

You O
don O
t O
understand O
This O
effing O
sucks O
I O
have O
the O
vomiting B-DIS
kind O
. O
On O
bad O
days O
weeks O
, O
I O
switch O
to O
high O
protein O
whey O
based O
shakes O
. O
Usually O
mixed O
with O
soy O
milk O
instead O
of O
water O
. O
They O
re O
filling O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
... O
I O
m O
still O
trying O
to O
figure O
that O
out O
. O
It O
sucks O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
my O
whole O
life O
has O
changed O
. O
 
You O

got O
it O
. O
It O
s O
rough O
on O
the O
kids O
at O
any O
age O
. O
Pm O
me O
if O
you O
have O
any O
questions O
. O
 
I O
think O
I O
m O
definitely O
going O
to O
try O
either O
vaping O
or O
I O
ve O
seen O
drops O
that O
you O
can O
put O
under O
your O
tongue O
. O
 
Simple O
answer O
is O
yes O
. O
 
One O
piece O
of O
advice O
i O
d O
give O
any O
prime O
carer O
is O
to O
question O
and O
oversee O
everything O
A O
true O
clinician O
and O
thinker O
would O
welcome O
any O
questioning O
and O
be O
open O
to O
discussion O
. O
As O
a O
prime O
carer O
of O
my O
Mother O
suffering O
dementia B-DIS
I O
accompany O
her O
to O
GP O
appointments O
, O
Psych O
appointments O
, O
hospital O
appointments O
the O
lot O
. O
The O
Psychiatrist O
is O
really O
proactive O
and O
wants O
the O
family O
to O
be O
involved O
and O
researching O
themselves O
. O
One O
reason O
I O
try O
to O
now O
oversee O
everything O
is O
because O
, O
My O
mother O
who O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
dementia B-DIS
a O
couple O
of O
months O
ago O
was O
taking O
a O
tablet O
known O
by O
Psychiatrists O
to O
affect O
the O
brain O
and O
enhance O
cognitive O
decline O
. O
Once O
this O
was O
spotted O
, O
the O
Psychiatrist O
wrote O
a O
letter O
to O
the O
GP O
asking O
for O
this O
tablet O
to O
be O
replaced O
by O
another O
that O
did O
not O
affect O
the O
brain O
. O
I O
was O
really O
upset O
and O
angry O
when O
I O
attended O
the O
GP O
appointment O
with O
my O
mum O
to O
find O
not O
only O
did O
the O
GP O
not O
read O
the O
letter O
or O
my O
mums O
notes O
that O
were O
passed O
on O
way O
before O
we O
were O
due O
to O
meet O
, O
but O
I O
had O
to O
give O
her O
a O
print O
out O
to O
read O
the O
letter O
in O
front O
of O
us O
, O
for O
her O
to O
turn O
to O
us O
and O
say O
I O
will O
prescribe O
** O
the O
tablet O
that O
caused O
severe B-DIS
mental I-DIS
impairment I-DIS
. O
So O
now O
not O
only O
has O
she O
been O
given O
this O
golden O
information O
in O
3 O
different O
formats O
but O
has O
now O
come O
up O
with O
the O
incorrect O
solution O
. O
After O
questioning O
her O
decision O
rather O
furiously O
she O
realized O
the O
mistake O
and O
give O
us O
the O
tablet O
the O
Psychiatrist O
recommended O
. O
3 O
months O
on O
from O
this O
my O
mum O
is O
a O
totally O
different O
person O
. O
No O
more O
hallucinations B-DIS
, O
language B-DIS
is I-DIS
more I-DIS
fluid I-DIS
and O
sentence O
structures O
intact O
. O
Although O
memory B-DIS
is I-DIS
still I-DIS
impaired I-DIS
to O
some O
degree O
it O
is O
a O
 
remarkable O
turn O
around O
. O
We O
know O
as O
a O
family O
the O
dementia B-DIS
will O
always O
be O
there O
from O
now O
on O
but O
one O
tablet O
has O
transformed O
my O
mums O
way O
of O
living O
for O
the O
time O
being O
. O
I O
have O
learn O
t O
to O
question O
everything O
but O
also O
realize O
even O
GP O
s O
and O
doctors O
in O
other O
areas O
outside O
of O
Psychiatry O
Mental O
diseases O
simply O
do O
not O
know O
enough O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
when O
dealing O
with O
patients O
will O
mental B-DIS
impairments I-DIS
. O
Just O
because O
they O
are O
doctors O
does O
not O
automatically O
make O
them O
the O
most O
informed O
. O
On O
a O
day O
to O
day O
basis O
I O
find O
not O
stressing B-DIS
my O
Mum O
out O
by O
asking O
specific O
questions O
helps O
a O
lot O
. O
If O
i O
find O
her O
stuck O
on O
a O
sentence O
or O
word O
, O
i O
simply O
try O
to O
bypass O
this O
by O
moving O
on O
with O
the O
conversation O
or O
offering O
my O
sentences O
around O
it O
to O
make O
the O
conversation O
flow O
. O
I O
can O
see O
the O
frustration O
building O
up O
quickly O
when O
a O
word O
wont O
spring O
to O
mind O
. O
Its O
heartbreaking O
. O
 
If O
it O
helps O
some O
people O
, O
I O
m O
happy O
for O
them O
. O
It O
doesn O
t O
work O
for O
me O
though O
, O
it O
hurts B-DIS
me O
more O
than O
anything O
. O
 
Guess O
who O
s O
back O
. O
 
Adam O
s O
Song O
- O
Blink O
182 O
, O
each O
time O
I O
hear O
the O
line O
16 O
just O
held O
such O
better O
days O
I O
tear O
up O
and O
cry O
my O
heart O
out O
. O
I O
also O
like O
listening O
to O
Radiohead O
, O
Eminem O
has O
got O
some O
good O
songs O
about O
going O
through O
struggle O
too O
. O
I O
listen O
to O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
things O
, O
but O
the O
songs O
all O
have O
one O
thing O
in O
common O
, O
they O
don O
t O
hide O
how O
utterly O
awful O
it O
feels O
, O
they O
don O
t O
even O
try O
to O
be O
uplifting O
, O
it O
s O
just O
about O
that O
emotion O
. O
how O
about O
you O
 
Thanks O
. O
I O
too O
started O
leaving O
many O
hours O
between O
my O
vitamins B-DRUG
and O
the O
hormones B-DRUG
 
I O
have O
been O
caring O
for O
my O
36 O
year O
old O
friend O
since O
September O
last O
year O
. O
Well O
, O
at O
least O
the O
korsakoff B-DIS
part O
. O
Been O
dealing O
with O
her O
for O
a O
few O
years O
now O
. O
Anyway O
, O
eight O
months O
ago O
she O
almost O
died O
. O
However O
after O
12 O
hours O
of O
research O
while O
the O
doc O
was O
standing O
around O
scratching O
his O
head O
, O
I O
suggested O
the O
thiamin B-DRUG
. O
Long O
story O
short O
. O
She O
wasn O
t O
given O
the O
recommended O
dosage O
and O
was O
taken O
off O
a O
couple O
times O
out O
of O
the O
gate O
. O
Now O
I O
have O
a O
36 O
year O
old O
with O
a O
12 O
year O
old O
mentality O
, O
a O
ten O
minute O
memory O
span O
, O
and O
she O
is O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
. O
I O
have O
spent O
hours O
and O
hours O
continuing O
to O
research O
this O
syndrome O
. O
There O
isn O
t O
much O
out O
there O
on O
the O
subject O
. O
The O
general O
consensus O
is O
that O
her O
current O
condition O
is O
as O
good O
as O
its O
going O
to O
get O
. O
I O
just O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
accepting O
that O
. O
Especially O
considering O
some O
of O
the O
stuff O
I O
ve O
read O
on O
neuroplasticity O
. O
And O
like O
the O
previous O
posting O
, O
she O
doesn O
t O
seem O
to O
want O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
. O
Now O
I O
think O
in O
her O
case O
EVERYTHING O
all O
stems O
back O
to O
the O
short B-DIS
term I-DIS
memory I-DIS
. O
When O
I O
talk O
to O
her O
about O
her O
condition O
in O
a O
serious O
manner O
, O
she O
is O
totally O
there O
. O
But O
10 O
minutes O
later O
... O
You O
get O
the O
idea O
. O
I O
guess O
my O
question O
, O
if O
I O
really O
have O
a O
question O
, O
is O
how O
can O
I O
possibly O
get O
her O
motivated O
to O
WORK O
at O
getting O
better O
And O
what O
was O
your O
experience O
with O
your O
patient O
and O
how O
long O
were O
you O
with O
them O
. O
She O
is O
only O
36 O
and O
she O
has O
4 O
kids O
all O
under O
13 O
. O
Her O
family O
has O
walked O
away O
from O
her O
cause O
she O
is O
an O
 
embarrassment O
so O
it O
s O
just O
me O
. O
Any O
insight O
would O
be O
helpful O
. O
 
Test O
is O
positive O
for O
UTI B-DIS
. O
Called O
Dr. O
On O
a O
10 O
day O
antibiotic B-DRUG
now O
 
Ooookay O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
come O
across O
anything O
that O
has O
said O
aldosterone B-DRUG
is O
high O
in O
hpots O
. O
That O
s O
good O
to O
know O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
been O
tested O
for O
pots O
at O
all O
. O
My O
only O
diagnoses O
was O
Innapropriate B-DIS
Sinus I-DIS
Tachycardia I-DIS
a O
few O
years O
ago O
after O
wearing O
a O
30 O
day O
heart O
monitor O
. O
And O
drug B-DIS
resistant I-DIS
hypertension I-DIS
. O
 
I O
ll O
definitely O
have O
to O
talk O
to O
doctors O
about O
it O
because O
swimming O
is O
my O
main O
way O
of O
working O
out O
. O
With O
EDS B-DIS
and O
IST B-DIS
POTS B-DIS
, O
it O
s O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
do O
without O
dislocations B-DIS
or O
frequent B-DIS
syncope I-DIS
. O
However O
, O
if O
they O
recommend O
a O
central O
line O
I O
ll O
consider O
. O
It O
ll O
just O
be O
a O
lot O
to O
go O
over O
if O
he O
even O
agrees O
to O
try O
in O
the O
first O
place O
haha O
. O
And O
I O
m O
sorry O
you O
can O
t O
swim O
anymore O
. O
Thank O
you O
again O
so O
much O
for O
your O
responses O
Both O
of O
them O
were O
really O
helpful O
and O
informative O
 
Sorry O
just O
to O
be O
clear O
, O
you O
re O
saying O
replacing O
the O
lancet O
too O
often O
causes O
this O
Or O
am O
i O
missing O
a O
joke O
Serious O
question O
, O
just O
trying O
to O
understand O
 
Yes O
. O
I O
am O
in O
Australia O
though O
, O
so O
the O
process O
is O
possibly O
different O
from O
wherever O
you O
are O
. O
My O
symptoms O
are O
much O
the O
same O
as O
you O
describe O
. O
On O
the O
paperwork O
my O
neuros O
listed O
fatigue B-DIS
and O
difficulty B-DIS
concentrating I-DIS
as O
the O
primary O
symptoms O
. O
Have O
you O
tried O
any O
medications O
for O
concentration B-DIS
Things O
like O
Modafinil B-DRUG
are O
often O
prescribed O
for O
fatigue B-DIS
concentration O
and O
I O
found O
it O
kept O
me O
going O
for O
years O
before O
I O
had O
to O
give O
up O
work O
altogether O
. O
 
Hmm O
... O
kind O
of O
like O
how O
when O
you O
re O
really O
sick O
you O
don O
t O
really O
feel O
like O
laughing O
or O
crying O
you O
just O
feel O
really O
miserable B-DIS
 
I O
am O
very O
rarely B-DIS
thirsty I-DIS
too O
. O
Yesterday O
I O
got O
in O
maybe O
12oz O
total O
. O
FAAAIILL O
Thankful O
for O
my O
port O
but O
what O
a O
pain O
 
so O
lilith O
refused O
to O
be O
submissive O
to O
adam O
and O
then O
flew O
off O
into O
the O
night O
an O
slept O
witha O
lot O
of O
people O
. O
maybe O
just O
myth O
or O
an O
artistic O
projection O
of O
fears O
. O
lilith O
and O
samael O
were O
partners O
supposedly O
, O
butmaybe O
that O
s O
in O
my O
head O
too O
. O
connecting O
the O
latter O
to O
actual O
people O
iknow O
and O
getting O
worried O
. O
but O
lilith O
is O
an O
archetype O
. O
not O
necessarily O
one O
woman O
 
Posted O
by O
zdoggmd O
, O
apparently O
some O
sort O
of O
internet O
celebrity O
, O
AKA O
Dr. O
Zubin O
Damania O
, O
founder O
of O
Turntable O
Health O
in O
Las O
Vegas O
NV O
. O
I O
don O
t O
have O
to O
tell O
y O
all O
how O
infuriating O
this O
is O
. O
We O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
misinformation O
about O
diabetes B-DIS
constantly O
, O
an O
MD O
sharing O
a O
meme O
like O
this O
Heartbreaking O
. O
Even O
more O
so O
, O
the O
comments O
where O
people O
are O
tagging O
their O
friends O
and O
laughing O
. O
 
Here O
north O
of O
Denver O
we O
had O
a O
Vietnamese O
refugee O
immigration O
center O
in O
the O
70s O
, O
so O
we O
have O
a O
ton O
of O
good O
pho O
, O
and O
a O
large O
hispanic O
population O
so O
taquerias O
are O
everywhere O
. O
Where O
do O
you O
live O
that O
knows O
the O
joys O
of O
chilaquiles O
and O
pho O
People O
tell O
me O
the O
Pho O
in O
California O
is O
much O
better O
than O
ours O
, O
but O
California O
doesn O
t O
have O
green O
chile O
; O
so O
they O
don O
t O
count O
. O
 
This O
is O
all O
SUPER O
solid O
advice O
. O
I O
would O
also O
recommend O
the O
selenium B-DRUG
. O
It O
*is* O
possible O
to O
get O
too O
much O
, O
but O
if O
she O
stays O
at O
200 O
mcg O
not O
mg O
a O
day O
that O
won O
t O
be O
a O
problem O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
the O
general O
population O
is O
selenium B-DIS
deficient I-DIS
and O
it O
s O
especially O
important O
for O
those O
with O
thyroid B-DIS
issues I-DIS
symptoms B-DIS
. O
 
One O
day O
4 O
years O
ago O
I O
woke O
up O
and O
thought O
I O
had O
a O
killer O
flu B-DIS
. O
Dizzy O
, O
vomiting B-DIS
, O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
, O
brain B-DIS
fog I-DIS
. O
Those O
symptoms O
lasted O
for O
12 O
days O
. O
That O
was O
my O
first O
attack O
. O
So O
I O
guess O
mine O
was O
sprung O
on O
me O
over O
night O
As O
for O
the O
blood O
vessels O
, O
I O
can O
t O
comment O
as O
my O
MRI O
turned O
up O
clear O
. O
 
Thanks O
man O
. O
Yeah O
I O
m O
not O
worried O
. O
I O
m O
not O
even O
worried O
about O
it O
being O
a O
Parkinsonism B-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
of O
some O
sort O
. O
I O
just O
want O
to O
know O
what O
the O
hell O
is O
wrong O
with O
me O
really O
. O
 
The O
early O
access O
priority O
670G O
systems O
are O
just O
starting O
to O
be O
shipped O
out O
this O
month O
, O
so O
you O
will O
most O
likely O
be O
seeing O
more O
and O
more O
testimonials O
on O
this O
sub O
in O
the O
coming O
weeks O
. O
I O
will O
personally O
be O
posting O
my O
experience O
with O
my O
670G O
once O
I O
receive O
and O
have O
used O
it O
for O
10 O
days O
or O
so O
. O
 
Moving O
. O
Dual O
residency O
or O
taking O
a O
position O
abroad O
with O
a O
company O
. O
Have O
to O
graduate O
college O
first O
, O
so O
that O
s O
a O
year O
out O
. O
But O
I O
m O
hoping O
to O
look O
at O
what O
the O
countries O
offer O
around O
that O
time O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
m O
so O
used O
to O
and O
somewhat O
okay O
with O
paying O
for O
medical O
stuff O
at O
this O
point O
, O
that O
even O
going O
somewhere O
like O
the O
UK O
, O
I O
wouldn O
t O
even O
balk O
at O
the O
private O
prices O
compared O
to O
the O
free O
NHS O
, O
since O
their O
private O
pay O
prices O
are O
still O
fractions O
of O
what O
we O
pay O
here O
. O
 
I O
ordered O
my O
Livia B-DRUG
last O
summer O
and O
it O
finally O
arrived O
. O
I O
used O
it O
for O
the O
first O
time O
today O
. O
It O
certainly O
had O
a O
soothing O
effect O
I O
do O
get O
very O
painful B-DIS
periods I-DIS
, O
but O
since O
my O
IC B-DIS
is O
mainly O
urgency B-DIS
and O
frequency B-DIS
, O
I O
can O
t O
say O
if O
Livia B-DRUG
helps O
with O
pain B-DIS
. O
Will O
certainly O
report O
back O
though O
in O
the O
coming O
days O
. O
 
Phew O
Heparin B-DRUG
is O
somewhat O
structurally O
similar O
to O
the O
lining O
of O
the O
bladder O
wall O
, O
so O
instilling O
it O
is O
thought O
to O
help O
protect O
the O
bladder O
from O
urine O
. O
The O
oral O
drug O
Elmiron B-DRUG
works O
in O
a O
similar O
way O
. O
Personally O
I O
find O
lidocaine B-DRUG
very O
helpful O
even O
for O
urgency B-DIS
frequency B-DIS
, O
not O
just O
pain B-DIS
. O
I O
hope O
it O
helps O
you O
too O
 
Why O
are O
you O
scared O
Its O
a O
great O
medication O
, O
famous O
for O
having O
very O
little O
side-effects O
. O
Just O
if O
you O
start O
getting O
rashes B-DIS
go O
to O
the O
emergency O
room O
. O
Ironically O
, O
I O
reacted O
very O
badly O
to O
it O
. O
I O
had O
no B-DIS
appetite I-DIS
at O
all O
, O
I O
d O
get O
nauseated B-DIS
by O
the O
smallest O
food O
. O
Lost O
20 O
pounds O
in O
1.5 O
months O
. O
And O
the O
loss B-DIS
of I-DIS
appetite I-DIS
lasted O
like O
2 O
months O
after O
I O
stopped O
taking O
it O
. O
A O
neurologist O
told O
me O
a O
mistake O
I O
made O
was O
taking O
the O
pill O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
increasing O
the O
dose O
too O
fast O
. O
Anyway O
, O
I O
don O
t O
think O
you O
should O
worry O
cuz O
I O
m O
in O
a O
very O
small O
minority O
. O
My O
psychiatrist O
said O
I O
was O
his O
first O
patient O
to O
react O
poorly O
to O
it O
. O
 
It O
s O
not O
terminal O
in O
the O
death O
way O
, O
but O
the O
energy O
in O
my O
life O
seems O
terminal O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
to O
seriously O
reconsider O
the O
direction O
of O
my O
future O
. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
5 O
years O
ago O
and O
have O
felt O
unwell O
for O
10 O
. O
Only O
my O
spouse O
understands O
. O
To O
be O
honest O
, O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
I O
could O
have O
ever O
understood O
a O
friend O
or O
family O
member O
with O
this O
condition O
before O
I O
got O
sick O
. O
I O
imagine O
it O
s O
hard O
, O
there O
isn O
t O
a O
lot O
I O
can O
do O
for O
myself O
other O
than O
take O
my O
meds O
and O
argue O
with O
doctors O
, O
so O
there O
is O
even O
less O
a O
loved O
one O
can O
do O
. O
My O
spouse O
will O
encourage O
me O
to O
do O
things O
, O
mostly O
in O
a O
loving O
way O
without O
nagging O
. O
It O
s O
a O
worthwhile O
effort O
. O
I O
do O
have O
fun O
and O
it O
s O
not O
like O
any O
amount O
of O
sleep O
makes O
me O
less O
tired O
. O
 
I O
m O
not O
posting O
there O
. O
I O
have O
that O
pill O
but O
I O
don O
t O
need O
it O
. O
 
Hang O
in O
there O
As O
someone O
in O
their O
late O
20s O
as O
well O
I O
understand O
how O
difficult O
it O
can O
be O
to O
have O
a O
condition O
that O
is O
generally O
unseen O
by O
normal O
people O
. O
I O
am O
an O
audio O
engineer O
and O
it O
was O
extremely O
depressing O
to O
start O
loosing B-DIS
some I-DIS
of I-DIS
my I-DIS
hearing I-DIS
in I-DIS
one I-DIS
ear I-DIS
. O
How O
could O
I O
ever O
mix O
music O
again O
What O
will O
happen O
to O
my O
career O
Will O
I O
ever O
enjoy O
music O
the O
same O
way O
The O
answer O
was O
to O
diversify O
and O
move O
into O
commercial O
audio O
visual O
where O
I O
don O
t O
need O
to O
do O
such O
critical O
listening O
. O
Just O
remember O
that O
some O
people O
can O
not O
manage O
their O
vertigo B-DIS
attacks O
The O
fact O
that O
you O
have O
been O
able O
to O
maintain O
6 O
months O
without O
vertigo B-DIS
is O
a O
major O
accomplishment O
that O
you O
should O
feel O
proud O
of O
. O
Never O
feel O
alone O
, O
47 O
of O
adults O
have O
a O
chronic O
illness O
. O
Finding O
and O
embracing O
your O
new O
normal O
can O
be O
hard O
but O
I O
feel O
is O
important O
to O
moving O
on O
. O
Time O
wasted O
worrying O
about O
things O
outside O
of O
your O
control O
is O
time O
better O
spent O
doing O
more O
productive O
activities O
. O
I O
still O
turn O
down O
the O
occasional O
social O
event O
if O
my O
ears O
are O
really O
bad O
for O
fear O
of O
having O
vertigo B-DIS
outside O
of O
the O
house O
but O
I O
try O
my O
best O
to O
not O
let O
it O
be O
a O
brick O
wall O
. O
If O
you O
feel O
therapy O
is O
the O
answer O
I O
won O
t O
stop O
you O
. O
I O
know O
I O
won O
t O
be O
able O
to O
solve O
everything O
through O
a O
reddit O
reply O
. O
But O
just O
remember O
that O
there O
are O
good O
days O
and O
bad O
, O
especially O
with O
a O
condition O
like O
Meniere O
s O
, O
and O
it O
looks O
like O
you O
have O
found O
6 O
months O
of O
good O
days O
In O
three O
words O
I O
can O
sum O
up O
everything O
I O
ve O
learned O
about O
life O
it O
goes O
on O
. O
- O
Robert O
Frost O
 
I O
hope O
you O
break O
records O
with O
this O
good O
streak O
 
Oh O
ok O
I O
understand O
now O
. O
I O
get O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
when O
leaning O
forward O
or O
speaking O
; O
food B-DIS
just I-DIS
comes I-DIS
up I-DIS
without I-DIS
warning I-DIS
, O
no B-DIS
nausea I-DIS
. O
That O
has O
to O
be O
frustrating O
 
Didn O
t O
drink O
anything O
for O
10 O
days O
and O
my O
ibs O
was O
about O
the O
same O
, O
not O
better O
, O
not O
worse O
. O
Drinking O
a O
nice O
Belgian O
quadruple O
while O
writing O
this O
. O
 
It O
s O
not O
flavored O
**at O
all** O
, O
is O
the O
thing O
. O
iirc O
it O
s O
literally O
just O
puffed O
corn O
. O
I O
think O
. O
 
So O
sorry O
you O
are O
going O
through O
this O
, O
people O
can O
be O
so O
dumb O
. O
 
How O
often O
do O
you O
need O
to O
take O
taltz B-DRUG
and O
how O
long O
do O
you O
need O
to O
be O
on O
for O
Is O
it O
something O
needed O
to O
take O
regular O
Taltz B-DRUG
is O
expensive O
and O
I O
d O
hope O
it O
s O
something O
I O
could O
go O
on O
until O
the O
skin O
is O
cleared O
of O
psoriasis B-DIS
. O
 
Yeah O
I O
had O
horrible- O
HORRIBLE O
- O
recurring O
yeast O
that O
could O
not O
be O
treated O
by O
typical O
means O
last O
spring O
summer O
. O
I O
ended O
up O
using O
the O
boric B-DRUG
acid I-DRUG
suppositories I-DRUG
. O
Pretty O
effective O
. O
In O
my O
case O
, O
I O
used O
them O
for O
about O
2 O
weeks O
. O
Just O
make O
sure O
you O
rub O
off O
excess O
powder O
from O
the O
gel O
caps O
and O
wash O
your O
hands O
immediately O
if O
you O
make O
your O
own O
suppositories O
much O
more O
effective O
than O
buying O
them O
off O
Amazon O
. O
If O
you O
experience O
any O
irritation B-DIS
from O
boric O
acid O
suppositories O
, O
you O
can O
follow O
up O
with O
tea B-DRUG
tree I-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
suppositories I-DRUG
can O
get O
at O
Whole O
Foods O
. O
They O
are O
very O
soothing O
and O
also O
have O
a O
slight O
bit O
of O
pH O
balancing O
properties O
, O
I O
believe O
. O
Also O
, O
you O
can O
get O
the O
diflucan B-DRUG
pill I-DRUG
from O
your O
doctor O
or O
if O
you O
re O
resistant O
like O
me O
, O
you O
could O
try O
ketoconazole B-DRUG
in O
pill O
form O
. O
Good O
luck O
 
I O
admire O
you O
for O
not O
letting O
your O
body O
get O
in O
the O
way O
of O
doing O
what O
you O
want O
to O
do O
. O
Take O
care O
of O
yourself O
and O
your O
loved O
ones O
. O
 
Oh O
man O
, O
yeah O
I O
actually O
address O
it O
head-on O
with O
the O
barber O
no O
pun O
intended O
and O
I O
say O
, O
I O
ve O
got O
really B-DIS
dry I-DIS
skin I-DIS
-- O
sort O
of O
like O
psoriasis B-DIS
-- O
it O
flakes B-DIS
a O
lot O
. O
It O
s O
not O
contagious O
or O
anything O
, O
and O
I O
see O
a O
doctor O
for O
it O
. O
Just O
wanted O
to O
let O
you O
know O
because O
I O
always O
feel O
awkward O
and O
get O
anxiety B-DIS
coming O
to O
the O
barber O
for O
haircuts O
. O
Now O
I O
imagine O
the O
idea O
of O
saying O
that O
-- O
it O
makes O
ME O
cringe O
. O
But O
I O
found O
by O
bringing O
it O
up O
right O
away O
, O
it O
gave O
ME O
control O
over O
the O
situation O
. O
And O
you O
know O
what O
It O
actually O
- O
sometimes O
- O
created O
some O
sympathy O
and O
compassion O
and O
connection O
with O
the O
barber O
. O
 
I O
actually O
used O
to O
get O
this O
all O
the O
time O
when O
I O
was O
on O
Levothyroxine B-DRUG
. O
The O
itching B-DIS
was I-DIS
mostly I-DIS
on I-DIS
my I-DIS
arms I-DIS
and I-DIS
legs I-DIS
, O
strangely O
. O
 
I O
ve O
never O
been O
diving O
but O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
that O
that O
obnoxious O
cramp B-DIS
that O
makes O
all O
of O
your O
toes O
stack O
up O
and O
pulls O
through O
the O
back O
of O
your O
calf O
became O
much O
more O
prevalent O
. O
Lots O
of O
water O
, O
and O
a O
couple O
bananas O
the O
night O
and O
again O
morning O
before O
you O
go O
should O
help O
a O
lot O
. O
 
I O
have O
GP B-DIS
and O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
. O
Use O
Omeprazole B-DRUG
to O
help O
with O
my O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
. O
Breads O
make O
my O
reflux B-DIS
worse O
, O
but O
no O
problems O
with O
fruit O
. O
 
Eucalyptus B-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
is O
great O
for O
clearing O
the O
sinuses O
I O
found O
it O
reduced O
pressure B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
ears I-DIS
too O
as O
theyre O
connected O
. O
Let O
us O
know O
how O
your O
appointment O
goes O
. O
 
Me O
too O
, O
I O
go O
see O
the O
judge O
this O
June O
July O
 
Thank O
you O
all O
for O
the O
help O
. O
He O
s O
supposed O
to O
see O
a O
neurologist O
in O
a O
couple O
weeks O
. O
The O
doctor O
that O
told O
him O
he O
could O
go O
back O
to O
work O
drive O
was O
a O
doctor O
at O
the O
assisted O
living O
facility O
where O
he O
was O
getting O
therapy O
for O
speech O
movement O
until O
he O
could O
come O
back O
home O
, O
so O
we O
are O
taking O
what O
he O
said O
with O
a O
grain O
of O
salt O
and O
hoping O
the O
neurologist O
will O
give O
more O
concrete O
info O
. O
 
hopefully O
you O
are O
addressing O
the O
condition O
in O
other O
ways O
, O
but O
for O
just O
the O
itch B-DIS
, O
applying O
lotion O
in O
ungodly O
amounts O
tends O
to O
help O
. O
Hot O
water O
can O
make O
things O
worse O
so O
avoid O
that O
. O
There O
s O
a O
small O
pill O
called O
Atarax B-DRUG
, O
its O
prescription O
only O
but O
it O
works O
wonders O
. O
You O
ll O
never O
feel O
any O
itching B-DIS
. O
It O
also O
may O
knock O
you O
out O
though O
 
Your O
endo O
is O
an O
idiot O
. O
Use O
these O
lists O
and O
find O
one O
who O
isn O
t O
. O
 
Curious O
about O
the O
probiotics B-DRUG
, O
were O
they O
suggested O
in O
conjunction O
w O
fodmap O
I O
did O
fodmap O
for O
3 O
years O
and O
had O
good O
results O
from O
that O
, O
but O
probiotics O
made O
me O
worse O
. O
 
This O
. O
 
I O
ve O
got O
the O
implant B-DRUG
and O
haven O
t O
noticed O
a O
difference O
between O
the O
pill O
not O
on O
pill O
implant O
and O
insulin O
requirements O
. O
 
I O
ve O
had O
decent O
results O
with O
it O
. O
I O
was O
a O
bit O
bloated B-DIS
at O
first O
, O
but O
not O
nauseous B-DIS
. O
I O
regularly O
have O
it O
for O
lunch O
now O
. O
 
If O
you O
want O
to O
talk O
im O
here O
buddy O
. O
I O
think O
i O
can O
understand O
you O
since O
im O
kinda O
in O
the O
same O
spot O
. O
 
Ooh O
, O
very O
curious O
to O
know O
other O
people O
s O
experiences O
with O
this O
- O
I O
m O
currently O
19 O
hours O
into O
a O
24 O
hour O
one O
haha O
please O
get O
this O
thing O
off O
me O
already.. O
My O
neuro O
sent O
me O
for O
it O
as O
there O
s O
no O
facilities O
for O
a O
TTT O
in O
this O
state O
and O
he O
clearly O
didn O
t O
want O
to O
do O
a O
poor O
man O
s O
TT.. O
 
That O
s O
my O
next O
course O
of O
action O
. O
I O
m O
just O
afraid O
of O
losing O
whatever O
hearing O
I O
have O
left O
on O
that O
ear O
. O
It O
s O
odd O
... O
.my O
hearing O
is O
either O
one O
of O
two O
ways O
. O
Sometimes O
it O
s O
full B-DIS
and I-DIS
blocked I-DIS
with O
no O
or O
very O
little O
tinnitus B-DIS
or O
it O
s O
open O
and O
clear O
but O
with O
very B-DIS
loud I-DIS
high-pitched I-DIS
tinnitus I-DIS
. O
The O
latter O
is O
actually O
a O
little O
better O
to O
deal O
with O
as O
I O
hate O
the O
fullness B-DIS
. O
 
This O
gave O
me O
a O
good O
chuckle O
, O
I O
went O
maybe O
40 O
times O
a O
day O
but O
have O
gotten O
it O
to O
about O
25 O
by O
drinking O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
at O
once O
and O
stretching O
the O
bladder O
. O
HURT O
Like O
hell O
, O
didn O
t O
help O
anything O
else O
but O
helped O
a O
bit O
with O
the O
frequency O
. O
 
Definitely O
been O
eating O
healthier O
and O
exercising O
as O
often O
as O
I O
can O
. O
I O
ve O
limited O
alcohol O
to O
1 O
or O
2 O
light O
beers O
a O
week O
. O
It O
does O
seem O
to O
help O
. O
I O
think O
the O
stress B-DIS
of O
living O
alone O
in O
a O
new O
city O
has O
also O
just O
inflamed O
my O
hypothyroid B-DIS
anxiety I-DIS
. O
Socializing O
and O
being O
around O
people O
has O
been O
the O
best O
anti-depressant O
I O
ve O
found O
. O
Keeps O
my O
mind O
from O
racing O
or O
worrying O
. O
 
Yep O

*There O
are O
a O
bunch O
of O
genetics B-DIS
issues I-DIS
that O
can O
be O
traced O
to O
our O
DNA O
. O
It O
seems O
those O
of O
us O
with O
Parkinson O
s O
also O
have O
a O
bunch O
of O
issues O
that O
cause O
our O
autoimmune B-DIS
systems I-DIS
to I-DIS
flair I-DIS
up I-DIS
. O
*This O
is O
a O
work O
in O
progress O
, O
but O
it O
wasn O
t O
until O
researchers O
had O
a O
huge O
database O
of O
those O
with O
Parkinson O
s O
did O
they O
realize O
the O
correlation O
with O
other O
genetic B-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O
My O
background O
in O
in O
Engineering O
, O
so O
the O
correlation O
studies O
make O
sense O
but O
this O
one O
is O
a O
mind O
full O
I O
have O
to O
read O
it O
a O
few O
times O
to O
get O
what O
the O
relationship O
is O

of O
Genetic O
comorbidities O
in O

A O
little O
easier O
to O
read O
, O
but O
summary O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
us O
with O
Parkinson O
s O
also O
have O
other O
genetic B-DIS
issues I-DIS
, O
such O
as O
Chron O
s O
Disease O
. O
It O
comes O
back O
to O
Parkinson O
s O
is O
a O
collection O
of O
issues O
, O
but O
we O
are O
all O
unique O
. O
I O
have O
Gastroparasis B-DIS
Issues I-DIS
, O
as O
my O
stomach B-DIS
and I-DIS
colon I-DIS
shut I-DIS
down I-DIS
for I-DIS
no I-DIS
known I-DIS
reason I-DIS
. O
Wasn O
t O
until O
I O
started O
of O
sinemet B-DRUG
did O
I O
realize O
it O
was O
related O
to O
Parkinson O
s O
issue O
. O
 
You O
might O
have O
triggered O
small O
intestinal O
bacterial O
or O
fungal O
overgrowth O
by O
messing O
with O
the O
pH O
of O
your O
digestive O
tract O
. O
Or O
it O
could O
be O
placebo O
. O
I O
d O
look O
into O
the O
possibility O
. O
 
Urea B-DRUG
is O
completely O
safe O
to O
use O
while O
breastfeeding O
. O
 
I O
was O
diagnosed O
in O
April O
and O
have O
been O
stuggling O
finding O
food O
that O
works O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time O
. O
One O
week O
rice O
is O
good O
the O
next O
week O
it O
makes O
me O
hurl O
. O
Is O
this O
what O
your O
wife O
has O
experienced O
I O
m O
still O
trying O
to O
figure O
out O
whats O
normal O
when O
you O
have O
gastroparesis B-DIS
. O
 
Has O
your O
pain B-DIS
also O
been O
managed O
I O
recently O
met O
up O
with O
my O
rheum O
, O
and O
he O
feels O
my O
inflammatory B-DIS
diseases I-DIS
are O
being O
controlled O
with O
the O
biologic B-DRUG
and O
DMARD B-DRUG
, O
but O
that O
my O
residual B-DIS
fatigue I-DIS
and O
pain O
could O
be O
caused O
by O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
. O
Could O
this O
be O
the O
case O
for O
you O
Hes O
suggesting O
I O
try O
aquatic B-DRUG
therapy I-DRUG
first O
to O
see O
how O
that O
helps O
. O
 
Do O
you O
know O
if O
it O
s O
safe O
to O
use O
with O
a O
CGM B-DRUG
too O
 
I O
can O
t O
answer O
your O
specific O
questions O
, O
but O
I O
have O
Hashimoto O
s O
currently O
untreated O
bc O
my O
TSH O
is O
normal O
and O
I O
ve O
noticed O
that O
alcohol O
triggers O
breakouts B-DIS
for O
me O
. O
Dairy O
is O
also O
known O
to O
cause O
issues O
for O
some O
people O
. O
Have O
you O
eliminated O
either O
of O
those O
Have O
you O
tried O
an O
autoimmune O
elimination O
diet O
I O
noticed O
no O
difference O
in O
my O
acne B-DIS
in O
relationship O
to O
gluten O
. O
I O
m O
currently O
gluten O
free O
. O
You O
may O
want O
to O
try O
following O
the O
skincare O
subreddits O
to O
learn O
about O
additional O
triggers O
and O
potential O
regimens O
you O
could O
try O
. O
Roaccutane B-DRUG
and O
similar O
prescriptions O
are O
pretty O
serious O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O
I O
do O
appreciate O
how O
life O
changing O
those O
options O
can O
be O
for O
extreme O
cases O
, O
but O
I O
feel O
like O
once O
you O
go O
that O
route O
you O
are O
masking O
the O
root O
cause O
. O
For O
example O
, O
say O
your O
body O
produces O
an O
immune O
response O
to O
eggs O
and O
that O
reaction O
manifests O
itself O
in O
acne B-DIS
, O
but O
instead O
of O
eliminating O
eggs O
and O
making O
your O
body O
happy O
and O
eliminating O
the O
acne B-DIS
naturally O
... O
you O
take O
the O
Roaccutane B-DRUG
to O
eliminate O
the O
acne B-DIS
. O
Your O
body O
is O
still O
being O
exposed O
to O
the O
toxin O
in O
this O
case O
eggs O
which O
is O
likely O
causing O
bigger O
issues O
within O
your O
body O
like O
increased B-DIS
inflammation I-DIS
. O
The O
worst O
part O
about O
all O
of O
that O
is O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
cause O
. O
There O
are O
so O
many O
Everything O
from O
the O
type O
of O
lotion O
you O
use O
, O
certain O
foods O
, O
water O
temperature O
, O
how O
often O
you O
wash O
your O
face O
, O
and O
so O
on O
. O
But O
, O
if O
I O
were O
you O
, O
I O
d O
do O
some O
research O
, O
create O
a O
small O
list O
things O
to O
try O
, O
do O
those O
things O
for O
a O
month O
, O
and O
see O
where O
that O
takes O
you O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O
 
Just O
read O
this O
list O
, O
can O
t O
agree O
with O
much O
of O
it O
. O
I O
love O
killer O
hot O
things O
, O
which O
provides O
that O
warm O
fuzzy O
feeling O
, O
and O
helps O
me O
forget O
the O
pain B-DIS
for O
a O
bit O
. O
THC B-DRUG
is O
still O
1 O
for O
relief O
IMO O
. O
 
Not O
scary O
at O
all O
. O
Prep O
isn O
t O
pleasant O
. O
The O
drink O
tastes O
awful O
and O
I O
basically O
just O
built O
myself O
a O
nest O
by O
the O
toilet O
to O
curl O
up O
in O
, O
between O
bouts O
of O
diarrhoea B-DIS
. O
You O
will O
need O
to O
be O
within O
running O
distance O
of O
the O
toilet O
for O
several O
hours O
. O
Get O
some O
lignocaine B-DRUG
gel I-DRUG
and O
lanoline B-DRUG
cream I-DRUG
. O
Your O
butthole O
will O
thank O
you O
. O
The O
trick O
is O
to O
apply O
them O
from O
the O
start O
, O
before O
you O
feel O
any O
discomfort B-DIS
. O
The O
procedure O
itself O
was O
a O
breeze O
. O
You O
just O
turn O
up O
, O
complete O
paperwork O
, O
go O
to O
sleep O
and O
they O
do O
all O
the O
work O
. O
It O
feels O
like O
you O
re O
only O
out O
for O
all O
of O
5 O
minutes O
when O
you O
wake O
up O
. O
Doze O
in O
recovery O
for O
a O
bit O
, O
get O
dressed O
once O
you O
re O
allowed O
up O
. O
Quick O
follow O
up O
consultation O
before O
you O
leave O
. O
Only O
side O
effects O
i O
had O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
gas B-DIS
. O
No O
discomfort O
despite O
having O
several O
polyps O
removed O
. O
Greatly O
reduced O
my O
abdo B-DIS
pain I-DIS
afterwards O
too O
. O
10 O
10 O
would O
do O
again O
... O
.. O
every O
3-5 O
years O
. O
 
Shouldn O
t O
have O
much O
of O
an O
effect O
. O
Psoriasis B-DIS
can O
be O
greatly O
improved O
with O
vitamin B-DRUG
D I-DRUG
, O
a O
byproduct O
of O
exposing O
the O
skin O
to O
sunlight O
. O
Salt O
water O
is O
also O
said O
to O
have O
a O
positive O
effect O
on O
plaques B-DIS
, O
probably O
mostly O
by O
softening O
the O
skin O
. O
Do O
you O
swim O
Physical O
exercise O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
have O
a O
positive O
effect O
on O
many O
patients O
. O
 
You O
could O
have O
a O
cyst B-DIS
in I-DIS
your I-DIS
urethra I-DIS
. O
At O
one O
time O
I O
did O
have O
that O
and O
it O
would O
cause O
pain B-DIS
burning B-DIS
when O
I O
urinated O
. O
Your O
cystoscopy B-DIS
would O
pick O
that O
up O
if O
you O
had O
one O
. O
Is O
your O
cystoscopy O
with O
hydrodistension O
That O
s O
where O
they O
fill O
your O
bladder O
up O
to O
see O
what O
it O
looks O
stretched O
, O
like O
it O
would O
be O
when O
it O
s O
filled O
with O
urine O
. O
If O
it O
s O
just O
a O
normal O
cystoscopy O
it O
may O
not O
be O
able O
to O
show O
if O
you O
have O
IC O
. O
That O
s O
bc O
your O
bladder O
walls O
have O
folds O
called O
rugae O
and O
you O
have O
to O
stretch O
them O
out O
to O
see O
your O
entire O
lining O
properly O
. O
I O
had O
one O
gynouro O
who O
wasn O
t O
knowledgeable O
and O
only O
did O
a O
cysto O
and O
couldn O
t O
find O
anything O
bc O
they O
didn O
t O
put O
my O
bladder O
under O
stress O
, O
when O
I O
had O
my O
second O
cysto O
this O
time O
with O
hydrodistension O
that O
s O
when O
they O
found O
all O
this O
inflammation B-DIS
, O
scarring B-DIS
, O
and O
pin B-DIS
point I-DIS
bleedings I-DIS
. O
So O
def O
make O
sure O
they O
re O
doing O
that O
and O
if O
they O
aren O
t O
, O
ask O
that O
it O
be O
done O
. O
Good O
luck O
with O
everything O
, O
I O
hope O
they O
figure O
out O
what O
it O
is O
. O
The O
worst O
part O
is O
not O
knowing O
and O
not O
feeling O
validated O
for O
your O
pain O
. O
I O
m O
sorry O
you O
re O
going O
through O
this O
and O
I O
feel O
your O
pain O
Let O
me O
know O
how O
the O
cysto O
goes O
 
What O
kind O
of O
clothes O
are O
you O
wearing O
and O
are O
you O
putting O

just O
wanted O
to O
let O
you O
know O
that O
it O

Why O
Because O

I O
couldn O
t O
help O
but O
chuckle O
while O
reading O
this O
. O
Yes O
, O
I O
figured O
this O
out O
quickly O
; O
lol O
 
It O
s O
so O
much O
fun O
 
The O
only O
thing O
that O
seems O
to O
help O
me O
with O
spasms B-DIS
is O
oxybuntin B-DRUG
. O
 
Thanks O
for O
the O
thoughtful O
response O
. O
She O
s O
had O
to O
leave O
work O
temporarily O
to O
try O
to O
relieve O
stress B-DIS
and O
get O
more O
sleep O
. O
We O
ve O
been O
seriously O
overhauling O
her O
diet O
over O
the O
last O
few O
weeks O
but O
it O
s O
such O
a O
transition O
for O
her O
we O
re O
taking O
it O
slow O
. O
She O
s O
always O
eaten O
very O
healthy O
foods O
but O
many O
of O
which O
are O
inflammatory B-DIS
. O
Hoping O
for O
some O
relief O
soon O
 
What O
kind O
of O
instillation O
are O
you O
getting O
There O
s O
a O
few O
different O
drugs O
that O
are O
administered O
that O
way O
. O
I O
have O
a O
really O
hard O
time O
with O
catheters O
, O
I O
find O
them O
insanely O
painful O
. O
One O
thing O
that O
helps O
is O
not O
tensing O
your O
muscles O
and O
staying O
relaxed O
. O
If O
you O
re O
like O
me O
and O
that O
sounds O
impossible O
, O
you O
can O
see O
if O
your O
doctor O
will O
give O
you O
a O
one-off O
prescription O
for O
an O
anti-anxiety O
drug O
like O
Xanax B-DRUG
. O
I O
use O
that O
about O
30 O
minutes O
prior O
to O
cytoscopy O
and O
it O
makes O
it O
a O
lot O
less O
painful O
both O
during O
and O
after O
. O
 
I O
asked O
my O
physical O
therapist O
out O
of O
curiosity O
, O
and O
yeah O
. O
She O
said O
it O
s O
just O
as O
effective O
. O
For O
your O
first O
appointment O
just O
ask O
to O
only O
do O
stretches O
external O
stuff O
if O
they O
don O
t O
already O
plan O
to O
. O
That O
way O
you O
can O
get O
it O
from O
their O
own O
mouth O
what O
will O
be O
going O
on O
the O
next O
time.. O
Plus O
once O
you O
learn O
the O
stretches O
you O
can O
do O
it O
at O
home O
. O
 
So O
, O
another O
fun O
new O
experience O
today O
. O
Sitting O
on O
a O
conference O
call O
at O
work O
when O
, O
out O
of O
the O
blue O
, O
tinnitus B-DIS
increases O
to O
an O
almost O
deafening O
volume O
. O
Think O
someone O
laying O
on O
their O
horn O
in O
traffic O
. O
It O
abated O
after O
a O
few O
minutes O
then O
recurred O
. O
Oddly O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
some O
of O
my O
hearing O
has O
returned O
but O
tinnitus O
remains O
at O
an O
elevated O
volume O
. O
 
There O
is O
a O
different O
medicine O
that O
does O
the O
same O
thing O
- O
you O
might O
call O
your O
regular O
dr O
and O
see O
if O
they O
would O
give O
you O
a O
script O
for O
it O
. O
The O
brand O
name O
is O
Rapaflo B-DRUG
. O
My O
urologist O
switched O
me O
due O
to O
the O
headaches B-DIS
. O
 
Thanks O
for O
the O
reply O
. O
I O
m O
just O
hoping O
to O
get O
the O
hair O
I O
lost O
back O
so O
I O
m O
happy O
to O
hear O
about O
your O
family O
results O
 
I O
m O
the O
same O
, O
I O
can B-DIS
no I-DIS
longer I-DIS
tolerate I-DIS
heat I-DIS
which O
is O
a O
definite O
trigger O
for O
my O
issues O
. O
My O
hearing O
is O
much O
better O
in O
winter O
. O
 
I O
don O
t O
envy O
you O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
two O
stones O
, O
22mm O
and O
then O
a O
26mm O
. O
First O
one O
removed O
using O
percutaneous O
lithotripsy O
through O
my O
back O
, O
and O
the O
second O
with O
two O
lithotripsy O
surgeries O
. O
Sucks O
. O
 
It O
feels O
like O
everything O
is O
trying O
to O
pull O
your O
attention O
RIGHT O
NOW O
and O
you O
get O
no O
time O
to O
focus O
on O
any O
one O
specific O
thing O
. O
And O
it O
s O
especially O
bad O
when O
it O
s O
crowded O
as O
heck O
and O
everyone O
is O
trying O
to O
force O
themselves O
through O
and O
not O
give O
two O
shits O
about O
not O
bumping O
or O
shoving O
you O
... O
 
We O
shouldn O
t O
, O
but O
we O
all O
do O
... O
It O
leaves O
scars B-DIS
though O
... O
. O
I O
have O
a O
few O
old O
patches O
that O
have O
been O
through O
the O
scratch O
till O
you O
bleed O
and O
some O
I O
haven O
t O
really O
touched O
compared O
to O
the O
worst O
ones O
. O
When O
I O
go O
to O
this O
three O
week O
sun O
treatment O
I O
end O
up O
100 O
clear O
, O
but O
the O
skin O
under O
the O
oldest O
and O
most O
scratched O
patches O
are O
different O
than O
the O
newer O
and O
untouched O
ones O
... O
They O
are O
darker O
and O
a O
little O
rougher O
to O
the O
feel.. O
 
Perhaps O
then O
natural O
anti-inflammatory O
compounds O
. O
He O
didn O
t O
didn O
t O
specify O
nsaids B-DRUG
; O
just O
said O
anti-inflammatory O
. O
There O
are O
supplements O
compounds O
out O
there O
like O
Zyflamend B-DRUG
, O
that O
use O
highly O
researched O
ingredients O
such O
as O
Turmeric B-DRUG
, O
specifically O
designed O
for O
that O
. O
 
gt O
; O
I O
ve O
known O
that O
I O
ve O
had O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
for O
some O
time O
now O
, O
but O
I O
haven O
t O
really O
felt O
the O
need O
to O
do O
something O
about O
it O
. O
I O
finally O
scheduled O
an O
appointment O
with O
an O
ENT O
, O
but O
is O
there O
a O
specific O
doctor O
I O
need O
to O
see O
for O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
Probably O
not O
an O
ENT O
. O
ENTs O
want O
to O
cut O
first O
and O
see O
if O
it O
helps O
later O
. O
Ideally O
, O
you O
want O
a O
sleep O
doctor O
. O
That O
would O
be O
someone O
who O
is O
board-certified O
in O
sleep O
medicine O
. O
This O
is O
often O
a O
pulmonologist O
, O
but O
not O
always O
. O
In O
the O
US O
, O
generally O
your O
primary O
care O
doc O
would O
refer O
you O
to O
the O
sleep O
doc O
who O
would O
order O
a O
sleep O
study O
for O
you O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
this O
depends O
on O
where O
you O
live O
and O
how O
your O
medical O
care O
gets O
paid O
for O
insurance O
, O
socialized O
, O
self-pay O
, O
etc O
. O
 
An O
hour O
, O
wow O
that O
s O
not O
bad O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
them O
hangout O
and O
chill O
in O
there O
like O
it O
was O
their O
home O
lol O
. O
You O
take O
that O
Flomax B-DRUG
or O
anything O
else O
, O
I O
heard O
the O
flomax B-DRUG
can O
really O
help O
, O
and O
will O
be O
making O
an O
appointment O
with O
a O
doctor O
for O
some O
myself O
. O
 
Sorry O
that O
should O
have O
read O

My O
PT O
works O
on O
a O
lot O
of O
men O
and O
yes O
, O
it O
s O
in O
the O
butt O
. O
I O
m O
a O
woman O
, O
but O
she O
does O
some O
of O
my O
treatment O
in O
the O
back O
as O
well O
, O
and O
it O
s O
not O
any O
more O
painful O
than O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
therapy O
-- O
definitely O
unpleasant O
at O
times O
, O
but O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O
 
Yes O
and O
yes O
. O
Don O
t O
use O
steroid B-DRUG
cream I-DRUG
on O
the O
penis O
unless O
directed O
to O
by O
your O
doc O
. O
Can O
cause O
thinning B-DIS
of I-DIS
surrounding I-DIS
skin I-DIS
or I-DIS
staining I-DIS
. O
 
Vit B-DRUG
D I-DRUG
is O
the O
single O
most O
thing O
my O
dr O
makes O
sure O
I O
take O
. O
 
Oh O
my O
gosh O
, O
I O
looked O
like O
I O
d O
lost O
a O
fight O
with O
a O
professional O
wrestler O
. O
Because O
I O
was O
completely O
blacked B-DIS
out I-DIS
at O
the O
point O
where O
you O
instinctively O
put O
your O
hands O
in O
front O
of O
you O
to O
protect O
your O
face O
. O
Somehow O
I O
managed O
to O
roll O
to O
the O
side O
just O
a O
bit O
, O
which O
kept O
me O
from O
knocking O
out O
any O
teeth O
, O
but O
I O
came O
down O
right O
on O
my O
chin O
and O
the O
the O
right O
side O
of O
my O
face O
. O
I O
worked O
at O
a O
magazine O
, O
and O
we O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
warehouse O
to O
try O
and O
find O
an O
ad O
in O
an O
old O
issue O
where O
the O
coloring O
was O
off O
. O
I O
warned O
them O
about O
the O
heat O
, O
but O
they O
said O
it O
was O
air O
conditioned O
. O
So O
I O
went O
with O
our O
distribution O
manager O
and O
layout O
director O
, O
two O
guys O
that O
I O
was O
close O
with O
and O
also O
both O
parents O
. O
So O
when O
I O
fell O
, O
they O
absolutely O
freaked O
. O
I O
knew O
how O
to O
get O
my O
blood O
pressure O
back O
up O
by O
pulling O
my O
knees O
up O
to O
my O
chest O
, O
because O
I O
knew O
I O
had O
to O
be O
conscious O
enough O
to O
tell O
them O
to O
get O
off O
of O
the O
phone O
with O
911 O
. O
I O
knew O
I O
would O
be O
fine O
once O
my O
blood O
pressure O
came O
back O
up O
, O
but O
they O
were O
all O
pale O
as O
ghosts O
. O
Now O
I O
know O
it O
was O
because O
my O
chin O
was O
already O
swelling B-DIS
and O
turning O
black O
and O
blue O
and O
every O
color O
you O
could O
think O
of O
, O
and O
my O
eye B-DIS
was I-DIS
starting I-DIS
to I-DIS
turn I-DIS
black I-DIS
. O
One O
of O
them O
called O
our O
head O
editor O
, O
who O
was O
freaking O
out O
trying O
to O
find O
my O
parents O
for O
some O
reason O
, O
even O
though O
she O
didn O
t O
know O
how O
to O
reach O
them O
it O
was O
a O
small O
office O
, O
so O
everyone O
was O
really O
close O
. O
I O
drove O
back O
to O
the O
office O
 
and O
tried O
to O
keep O
it O
covered O
, O
but O
everyone O
wanted O
to O
see O
and O
finally O
I O
started O
to O
feel O
a O
little O
punch-drunk B-DIS
and O
went O
home O
. O
The O
funniest O
thing O
about O
it O
was O
that O
when O
I O
went O
to O
my O
neurologist O
to O
get O
checked O
out O
the O
next O
day O
, O
he O
sent O
me O
for O
a O
CAT O
scan O
to O
make O
sure O
I O
hadn O
t O
fractured B-DIS
the O
right O
orbit O
. O
Both O
of O
my O
parents O
were O
in O
meetings O
, O
so O
my O
stepdad O
, O
who O
had O
just O
moved O
here O
recently O
, O
volunteered O
to O
take O
me O
. O
When O
he O
walked O
in O
with O
me O
, O
everyone O
just O
glared O
at O
him O
. O
I O
guess O
they O
thought O
he O
had O
beat O
me O
up O
and O
then O
had O
the O
audacity O
to O
go O
out O
in O
public O
with O
me O
. O
We O
still O
laugh O
about O
it O
. O
Then O
a O
week O
later O
the O
cut O
next O
to O
my O
eye O
turned O
into O
cellulitis B-DIS
. O
That O
s O
when O
it O
stopped O
being O
funny O
and O
turned O
to O
absolute O
misery O
. O
But O
after O
that O
incident O
, O
they O
never O
sent O
me O
out O
in O
the O
heat O
or O
had O
me O
do O
anything O
strenuous O
again O
 
Have O
an O
up O
vote O
My O
favourite O
website O
for O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
 
I O
have O
both O
IC B-DIS
and O
tight O
pelvic O
floor O
muscles O
. O
The O
bladder O
has O
receptors O
that O
sense O
pressure O
, O
but O
it O
doesn O
t O
know O
if O
the O
pressure O
is O
coming O
from O
within O
the O
bladder O
from O
urine O
or O
from O
the O
outside O
. O
If O
your O
pelvic O
floor O
muscles O
are O
tense O
and O
rigid O
, O
they O
can O
put O
pressure O
on O
your O
bladder O
. O
I O
would O
wait O
and O
see O
if O
pelvic O
floor O
physical O
therapy O
helps O
your O
bladder O
symptoms O
. O
If O
you O
still O
aren O
t O
sure O
, O
it O
never O
hurts O
to O
get O
a O
second O
opinion O
. O
It O
took O
visits O
to O
a O
nurse O
practitioner O
, O
two O
urologists O
, O
and O
a O
gynecologist O
until O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
. O
 
MS B-DIS
is O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
exclusion O
so O
there O
are O
no O
tests O
for O
MS. O
just O
tests O
that O
they O
can O
get O
clues O
, O
like O
, O
it O
s O
NOT O
Lyme B-DIS
disease I-DIS
, O
or O
getting B-DIS
warm I-DIS
makes I-DIS
your I-DIS
eye I-DIS
act I-DIS
up I-DIS
, O
so O
they O
d O
be O
like O
, O
oh O
, O
that O
s O
an O
MS O
thing O
, O
but O
even O
the O
lumbar O
puncture O
isn O
t O
definitive O
. O
MRIs O
give O
pretty O
good O
clues O
it O
seems O
, O
and O
sometimes O
an O
MRI O
can O
be O
nice O
and O
obvious O
. O
let O
the O
doc O
do O
their O
thing O
and O
stay O
tuned O
. O
 
Livabetic B-DIS
is O
my O
handicapable O
. O
As O
in O
, O
so O
you O
don O
t O
think O
I O
can O
do O
it O
Is O
it O
because O
I O
m O
livabetic B-DIS
Best O
done O
when O
deadpanned O
to O
people O
that O
don O
t O
know O
you O
re O
joking O
. O
 
I O
have O
a O
resmed O
s9 O
elite O
and O
it O
makes O
only O
a O
small O
air O
movement O
noise O
when O
I O
breathe O
out O
. O
The O
Transcend O
makes O
a O
slightly O
different O
noise O
but O
not O
really O
louder O
just O
different O
. O
I O
wouldn O
t O
want O
it O
as O
my O
primary O
because O
my O
S9 O
has O
so O
many O
better O
features O
, O
like O
automatically O
turning O
on O
when O
I O
put O
the O
mask O
on O
and O
breathe O
then O
turns O
off O
when O
I O
take O
the O
mask O
off O
while O
the O
transcend O
I O
have O
to O
push O
a O
button O
both O
times O
. O
I O
also O
don O
t O
have O
a O
humidifier O
for O
the O
transcend O
because O
I O
m O
going O
to O
use O
it O
when O
hiking O
and O
the O
humidifier O
has O
to O
be O
powered O
separately O
so O
I O
got O
some O
HME O
units O
that O
plug O
in O
line O
just O
before O
the O
mask O
that O
absorb O
and O
release O
moisture O
while O
you O
breathe O
. O
 
Did O
you O
happen O
to O
write O
a O
blog O
post O
on O
mornings O
with O
GP B-DIS
I O
think O
it O
was O
you O
but O
I O
can O
t O
find O
it O
to O
read O
again O
... O
 
I O
just O
bought O
one O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
. O
I O
got O
black O
so O
it O
ships O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
month O
. O
I O
m O
so O
happy O
to O
see O
positive O
reviews O
on O
it O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
finding O
a O
functional O
case O
that O
also O
doesn O
t O
look O
terrible O
has O
been O
a O
struggle O
for O
near O
20 O
years O
 
Well O
, O
nothing O
showed O
up O
in O
my O
urine O
culture O
so O
I O
don O
t O
know O
. O
I O
will O
try O
to O
stay O
calm O
 
Those O
are O
awesome O
sites O
that O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
bookmark O
Thanks O
for O
that O
. O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
check O
out O
r O
privacy O
at O
some O
point O
too O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
find O
more O
interesting O
stuff O
on O
Reddit O
everyday O
. O
 
Nice O
, O
good O
luck O
to O
you O
I O
take O
5,000 O
IU O
daily O
myself O
, O
and O
my O
levels O
are O
normal O
, O
so O
I O
bet O
this O
new O
dosage O
regimen O
will O
work O
out O
for O
you O
. O
 
It O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
get O
used O
to O
mine O
. O
 
Yes O
, O
a O
high B-DIS
arousal I-DIS
index I-DIS
is O
extremely O
disruptive O
to O
your O
sleep O
architecture O
. O
And O
yes O
, O
a O
deviated B-DIS
septum I-DIS
could O
be O
a O
reason O
that O
you O
have O
arousals B-DIS
. O
But O
for O
them O
to O
be O
associated O
it O
would O
likely O
be O
from O
UARS B-DIS
RERA B-DIS
. O
These O
are O
two O
mild O
forms O
of O
an O
obstructed B-DIS
airway I-DIS
that O
do O
not O
meet O
criteria O
to O
be O
scored O
as O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
. O
There O
is O
an O
arousal B-DIS
index O
and O
also O
an O
RDI O
which O
includes O
the O
scoring O
of O
RERA O
, O
which O
are O
snore B-DIS
breathing B-DIS
related I-DIS
issues I-DIS
resulting O
in O
an O
arousal O
. O
Too O
often O
having O
a O
high B-DIS
arousal I-DIS
index I-DIS
or O
UARS B-DIS
, O
it O
s O
very O
difficult O
to O
get O
resolution O
from O
these O
issues O
. O
The O
arousals B-DIS
could O
also O
be O
associated O
with O
PLMs B-DIS
. O
If O
there O
is O
nothing O
associated O
with O
the O
arousals B-DIS
themselves O
they O
are O
referred O
to O
as O
spontaneous B-DIS
arousals I-DIS
, O
which O
can O
also O
plague O
patients O
. O
With O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
, O
it O
s O
likely O
that O
the O
majority O
of O
these O
arousals B-DIS
are O
associated O
with O
your O
obstructed O
airway O
. O
 
This O
. O
Am O
totally O
clear O
after O
3 O
months O
on O
Cosentyx B-DRUG
. O
 
I O
used O
to O
be O
a O
strong O
moderate O
, O
but O
I O
d O
say O
I O
m O
medium O
moderate O
now O
after O
using O
lots O
of O
dovonex B-DRUG
almost O
entire O
trunk O
, O
chest O
, O
then O
back O
, O
arms O
and O
scalp O
, O
with O
a O
few O
spots O
on O
the O
legs O
. O
Just O
surprised O
I O
hadn O
t O
heard O
of O
it O
before O
I O
knew O
about O
the O
heart B-DIS
disease I-DIS
already O
. O
Edit O
. O
God O
that O
s O
a O
bleak O
list O
 
So O
one O
thing O
that O
can O
help O
and O
I O
don O
t O
see O
it O
mentioned O
a O
lot O
... O
Don O
t O
unnecessarily O
expose O
them O
to O
illness O
if O
you O
can O
help O
it O
. O
Every O
time O
I O
get O
an O
infection B-DIS
since O
I O
have O
a O
toddler O
now O
it O
seems O
I O
get O
a O
sinus B-DIS
infection I-DIS
or O
ear B-DIS
infection I-DIS
with O
every O
cold B-DIS
I O
have O
to O
go O
off O
meds O
which O
is O
SO O
FRUSTRATING O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
trying O
to O
get O
on O
Orencia B-DRUG
now O
which O
takes O
months O
to O
be O
effective O
and O
every O
time O
I O
get O
in O
a O
good O
few O
weeks O
where O
I O
take O
it O
some O
idiot O
comes O
in O
to O
work O
with O
shingles B-DIS
or O
strep B-DIS
or O
whatever O
because O
god O
forbid O
they O
use O
PTO O
and O
I O
get O
sick O
and O
then O
have O
to O
wait O
two O
weeks O
til O
the O
next O
dose O
and O
I O
m O
back O
off O
track O
and O
then O
unaware O
if O
the O
Orencia B-DRUG
isn O
t O
working O
for O
me O
or O
if O
it O
s O
the O
off O
and O
on O
again O
of O
it O
. O
Have O
a O
backup O
plan O
for O
meds O
too O
... O
out O
power O
went O
out O
and O
it O
took O
a O
whole O
day O
to O
get O
it O
back O
on O
so O
meds O
were O
toast O
. O
Damn O
near O
impossible O
to O
get O
them O
without O
paying O
a O
TON O
 
I O
m O
sorry O
to O
hear O
your O
situation O
. O
Try O
to O
remain O
upright O
and O
as O
active O
as O
possible O
. O
Take O
it O
easy O
though O
. O
Drink O
plenty O
of O
fluids O
 
Which O
is O
only O
a O
somewhat O
true O
statement O
because O
there O
hasn O
t O
been O
enough O
long O
term O
medical O
studies O
conducted O
to O
prove O
the O
medicine O
is O
safe O
for O
long O
term O
use O
. O
That O
statement O
assumes O
the O
drug O
is O
safe O
for O
long O
term O
use O
unless O
proven O
otherwise O
. O
The O
truth O
is O
, O
if O
you O
read O
the O
medical O
journals O
, O
scientists O
are O
not O
sure O
how O
Modafinil B-DRUG
actually O
affects O
the O
human O
brain O
and O
it O
will O
take O
several O
more O
decades O
woth O
of O
studies O
to O
be O
certain O
it O
doesn O
t O
cause O
any O
lasting O
or O
permanent O
damage O
. O
In O
the O
mean O
time O
it O
s O
advised O
to O
use O
it O
in O
moderation O
for O
short O
duration O
unless O
you O
have O
a O
serious O
medical O
problem O
like O
narcolepsy B-DIS
. O
 
yes O
, O
you O
*can* O
set O
up O
the O
machine O
and O
tune O
it O
, O
but O
it O
s O
not O
as O
good O
as O
an O
auto O
, O
because O
it O
won O
t O
respond O
to O
your O
needs O
throughout O
the O
night O
. O
I O
d O
suggest O
you O
download O

and O
sign O

cpaptalk.com O

or O
freecpapadvice.com O
forum O

and O
people O
there O
will O
help O
you O
get O
it O

as O
well O
as O
you O
can O
. O
you O
d O
probably O
do O
better O
with O
a O
dreamstation O
auto O
, O
which O
would O
cost O
considerably O
less O
. O
anyway O
, O
in O
the O

i O
d O
set O

see O
how O
you O

pull O

read O
all O
three O

your O
first O

above O
for O
advice O
. O
 
Always O
good O
to O
get O
fresh O
air O
in O
the O
scalp O
. O
That O
s O
why O
I O
never O
wear O
hats O
. O
 
It O
certainly O
might O
be O
helpful O
for O
you O
. O
The O
effectiveness O
of O
narcotics O
like O
Percocet B-DRUG
in O
IC B-DIS
patients O
is O
a O
mixed O
bag O
; O
some O
people O
get O
good O
pain B-DIS
relief O
, O
some O
find O
it O
just O
takes O
the O
edge O
off O
, O
and O
some O
people O
have O
no O
response O
whatsoever O
. O
Your O
primary O
care O
physician O
also O
might O
not O
be O
comfortable O
prescribing O
Percocet B-DRUG
since O
the O
standards O
for O
that O
drug O
have O
been O
swinging O
around O
wildly O
lately O
, O
but O
hopefully O
he O
or O
she O
can O
offer O
you O
something O
else O
to O
help O
with O
the O
pain O
. O
If O
you O
have O
discomfort B-DIS
around I-DIS
the I-DIS
urethral I-DIS
area I-DIS
topical B-DRUG
lidocaine I-DRUG
gel I-DRUG
can O
help O
with O
that O
, O
and O
some O
medications O
are O
available O
as O
vaginal O
suppositories O
Valium B-DRUG
is O
a O
common O
one O
that O
can O
help O
with O
pain B-DIS
throughout I-DIS
the I-DIS
pelvic I-DIS
area I-DIS
. O
If O
your O
doctor O
suspects O
pelvic O
floor O
involvement O
, O
muscle B-DRUG
relaxants I-DRUG
can O
also O
be O
an O
option O
. O
 
That O
s O
super O
cheap O
and O
affordable O
. O
Thanks O
My O
cpap B-DRUG
store O
sells O
them O
for O
like O
400-600 O
. O
 
Also O
consider O
seeing O
a O
sleep O
specialist O
. O
 
gt O
; O
A O
cure O
requires O
knowledge O
of O
the O
cause O
It O
absolutely O
does O
not O
require O
knowledge O
There O
are O
many O
cures O
that O
where O
not O
understood O
, O
just O
that O
they O
worked O
-- O
and O
years O
later O
they O
found O
out O
the O
cause O
. O
This O
happens O
in O
many O
fields O
, O
where O
you O
accidents O
create O
things O
. O
What O
if O
a O
Parkinson O
s O
patient O
had O
another O
disease O
that O
required O
fecal B-DRUG
transplant I-DRUG
, O
and O
then O
after O
the O
treatment O
, O
they O
suddenly O
did O
not O
have O
Parkinson O
s O
anymore O
. O
We O
would O
have O
found O
a O
cure O
, O
but O
there O
would O
still O
be O
additional O
research O
to O
find O
out O
the O
cause O
. O
So O
it O
s O
definitely O
not O
useless O
. O
 
My O
started O
in O
my O
wrists O
, O
then O
shoulders O
, O
then O
knees O
and O
hips O

Bow O

almost O
20 O
years O
after O

it O
s O
mostly O
my O
hands O

in O
constant O

and O
the O
bigger O

less O

had O
good O
luck O
with O
it O
. O
 
gt O
; O
Well O
I O
hate O
giving O
massages O
. O
Especially O
foot O
massages O
. O
They O
make O
my O
hands O
tired O
fast O
. O
But O
people O
in O
this O
thread O
said O
they O
loved O
it O
when O
someone O
e O
would O
give O
them O
a O
foot O
rub O
or O
a O
hand O
massage O
and O
that O
it O
was O
extra O
nice O
when O
they O
didn O
t O
have O
to O
ask O
. O
My O
wife O
knows O
I O
hate O
it O
and O
I O
used O
to O
groan O
and O
complain O
when O
she O
asked O
. O
But O
after O
hearing O
people O
on O
here O
say O
how O
much O
it O
helped O
them O
feel O
better O
. O
I O
decided O
I O
would O
never O
complain O
again O
and O
I O
would O
offer O
more O
. O
So O
I O
offer O
foot O
and O
hand O
rubs O
often O
. O
You O
are O
so O
sweet O
. O
That O
difference O
- O
from O
asking O
and O
getting O
complaints O
to O
getting O
more O
offers O
is O
a O
really O
meaningful O
change O
. O
 
Ooh O
Im O
gon O
na O
try O
that O
, O
thanks O
for O
the O
suggestion O
 
I O
agree O
with O
ParkieDude O
, O
although O
if O
he O
s O
a O
sharp-minded O
physician O
and O
board O
member O
of O
a O
hospital O
at O
80 O
, O
your O
grandfather O
probably O
doesn O
t O
need O
advice O
from O
us O
. O
My O
advice O
to O
you O
as O
a O
grandchild O
is O
to O
take O
this O
as O
a O
timely O
reminder O
to O
enjoy O
time O
with O
the O
people O
you O
love O
. O
 
Yes O
- O
they O
said O
to O
call O
right O
away O
to O
schedule O
a O
follow O
up O
even O
before O
they O
passed O
. O
Just O
in O
case O
for O
some O
reason O
they O
didn O
t. O
I O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
Monday O
to O
call O
since O
by O
the O
time O
we O
got O
home O
it O
was O
already O
past O
5 O
00 O
. O
 
I O
m O
on O
my O
third O
night O
with O
nasal B-DRUG
pillows I-DRUG
. O
I O
was O
scared O
to O
use O
it O
at O
first O
, O
it O
felt O
like O
so O
much O
pressure B-DIS
Last O
night O
it O
was O
on O
and O
I O
turned O
it O
off O
on O
because O
I O
thought O
it O
stopped O
working O
. O
I O
like O
the O
smaller O
mask O
and O
it O
s O
nice O
to O
have O
my O
mouth O
free O
for O
sneezing B-DIS
and O
talking O
to O
my O
wife O
; O
it O
s O
also O
easier O
to O
remove O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
can O
stay O
with O
the O
pillows O
, O
but O
yeah O
, O
open O
that O
mouth O
and O
whoosh O
No O
rainout O
on O
the O
pillows O
yet O
, O
but O
that O
s O
a O
function O
of O
temperature O
differences O
and O
not O
the O
kind O
of O
mask O
you O
are O
wearing O
, O
or O
so O
I O
was O
informed O
. O
 
Yes O
. O
Usually O
I O
have O
more O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
back I-DIS
. O
And O
this O
time O
not O
much O
pain O
while O
peeing O
. O
Even O
seems O
to O
be O
Regular O
amount O
Not O
much O
burning O
. O
That O
s O
why O
I O
wondered O
if O
it O
could O
be O
IBS O
symptoms O
first O
. O
I O
am O
a O
bit O
battle O
shy O
at O
this O
point O
because O
of O
the O
way O
I O
was O
treated O
in O
the O
ER O
last O
time O
. O
I O
now O
go O
straight O
to O
my O
urologist O
or O
GP O
at O
KAISER O
I O
know O
that O
the O
area O
in O
the O
groin O
is O
a O
nerve O
connection O
to O
the O
urethral O
area O
. O
It O
s O
been O
a O
while O
since O
I O
have O
had O
the O
zapping O
pains O
there O
. O
Usually O
it O
s O
right O
in O
the O
opening O
of O
my O
urethra O
that O
gets O
the O
zaps O
. O
 
I O
have O
, O
pre-RA O
days O
. O
Do O
they O
help O
I O
would O
have O
thought O
the O
humidity O
would O
make O
things O
hurt B-DIS
some O
but O
have O
no O
idea O
Wonder O
if O
I O
could O
work O
from O
sauna O
instead O
of O
work O
from O
home O
on O
those O
slower O
days O
 
My O
gf O
got O
diagnosed O
just O
before O
xmas O
and O
is O
on O
gab O
. O
She O
took O
3x O
daily O
300mgs O
and O
that O
didn O
t O
help O
much O
. O
She O
s O
on O
4 O
tabs O
a O
day O
split O
into O
3 O
dosages O
and O
still O
she O
is O
in O
a O
bit O
of O
pain B-DIS
day O
to O
day O
. O
So O
it O
may O
not O
be O
effective O
, O
I O
think O
she O
is O
looking O
into O
DMDs B-DIS
with O
her O
ms B-DIS
nurse O
specialist O
iirc O
 
Oh O
shit O
. O
My O
apologies O
, O
I O
still O
think O
about O
my O
procedure O
. O
I O
honestly O
don O
t O
know O
if O
they O
leave O
a O
string O
hanging O
out O
on O
girls O
or O
not O
If O
they O
do O
, O
you O
can O
take O
it O
out O
yourself O
. O
If O
not O
, O
have O
the O
conversation O
with O
your O
urologist O
. O
Good O
luck O
and O
thanks O
for O
the O
uncomfortable O
laugh O
I O
had O
this O
morning O
 
That O
s O
what O
I O
was O
thinking O
. O
I O
wasn O
t O
sure O
if O
it O
was O
more O
of O
an O
exfoliating O
thing O
or O
what O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
feedback O
 
For O
those O
who O
are O
saying O
they O
tried O
this O
and O
it O
worked O
for O
a O
little O
while O
or O
for O
people O
who O
dont O
want O
to O
try O
drugs O

My O
aunt O
is O
having O
major O
impulse O
control O
issues O
... O
specifically O
gambling O
. O
She O
s O
been O
on O
sinemet O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
but O
the O
issue O
persists O

She O

also O
likely O
going O
through O
a O
lot O
psychologically O
, O
and O
she O
s O
pretty O
depressed O
. O
I O
m O
wondering O
if O
anyone O
has O
had O
experience O
with O
taking O
anti-depressants O
with O
addiction-fighting O
characteristics O
. O
There O
are O
so O
many O
out O
there O
, O
and O
the O
side-effects O
and O
efficacy O
vary O
so O
much O
, O
it O
would O
really O
help O
to O
know O
if O
anyone O
had O
a O
positive O
experience O
with O
a O
certain O
drug O
. O
Thanks O

Aerobic O
threshold O
monitoring O

It O

I O
did O
pacing O
for O
a O
few O
years O
and O
didn O
t O
start O
making O
progress O
until O
I O
started O
AT O

Maybe O
I O
should O
take O
a O
walk O
outside O
sometime O
but O
I O
appreciate O
your O
input O

Thank O

Weight B-DIS
gain I-DIS
is O
listed O
on O
many O
symptom O
lists O
but O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
why O
. O
I O
just O
know O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
m O
able O
to O
eat O
any O
sort O
of O
food O
, O
I O
gain O
, O
unless O
I O
m O
well O
enough O
to O
work O
out O
. O
I O
ve O
lost O
weight O
calorie O
counting O
and O
such O
in O
the O
past O
so O
I O
m O
aware O
of O
how O
to O
weigh O
food O
, O
etc O
. O
It O
just O
is O
annoying O
because O
it O
might O
seem O
as O
if O
I O
m O
getting O
better O
, O
but O
I O
m O
not O
. O
I O
will O
lose O
during O
very O
bad O
flares O
so O
it O
s O
constantly O
up O
and O
down O
. O
 
Right O
I O
m O
not O
saying O
caregivers O
get O
government O
assistance O
. O
I O
m O
in O
South O
Africa O
where O
there O
is O
not O
a O
snowballs O
hope O
in O
hell O
of O
such O
assistance O
and O
I O
understand O
that O
s O
pretty O
much O
a O
universal O
outside O
of O
a O
select O
few O
countries O
 
Go O
all O
of O
us O
 
No O
. O
It O
doesn O
t O
make O
things O
better O
or O
make O
your O
illness O
go O
away O
-- O
but O
it O
can O
help O
to O
have O
someone O
there O
who O
is O
patient O
, O
loving O
and O
understanding O
of O
your O
illness O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
with O
my O
partner O
for O
over O
seven O
years O
and O
he O
s O
seen O
all O
the O
worst O
parts O
of O
me O
, O
but O
loves O
me O
enough O
to O
understand O
, O
love O
, O
and O
be O
firm O
in O
helping O
me O
through O
recovery O
. O
Unconditional O
love O
doesn O
t O
mean O
you O
get O
to O
walk O
all O
over O
them O
when O
you O
have O
a O
bad O
episode O
, O
it O
means O
they O
understand O
but O
they O
also O
stand O
strong O
and O
help O
you O
through O
those O
feelings O
rather O
than O
just O
allowing O
you O
to O
spew O
them O
all O
out O

His O
definition O
of O
success O
is O
very O
black O
and O
white O
-- O
and O
that O
is O
unhealthy O
with O
BPD B-DIS
. O
Success O
is O
trying O
, O
and O
that O
you O
are O
. O
Someone O
who O
has O
never O
battled O
both O
the O
inner O
and O
outer O
issues O
of O
BPD B-DIS
can O
never O
hope O
to O
understand O
the O
pit O
it O
often O
leaves O
you O
in O
. O
You O
do O
not O
want O
to O
be O
in O
the O
pit O
any O
longer O
, O
and O
you O
are O
looking O
for O
a O
way O
out O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
boyfriend O
becomes O
educated O
on O
BPD B-DIS
, O
and O
I O
hope O
he O
begins O
acknowledging O
your O
efforts O
. O
I O
think O
placing O
emphasis O
on O
your O
mental O
health O
efforts O
is O
a O
great O
way O
to O
illustrate O
to O
him O
what O
your O
needs O
and O
priorities O
truly O
are O
in O
this O
difficult O
time O
. O
I O
also O
think O
that O
whatever O
you O
choose O
to O
do O
should O
be O
a O
decision O
that O
sits O
well O
with O
*you* O
, O
one O
that O
you O
make O
without O
his O
judgement O
. O
You O
will O
get O
where O
you O
want O
to O
be O
, O
because O
you O
know O
yourself O
better O
than O
anybody O
else O
. O
He O
will O
get O
it O
in O
time O
. O
Until O
then O
, O
make O
the O
moves O
you O
need O
to O
make O
and O
don O
t O
let O
someone O
who O
doesn O
t O
get O
it O
yet O
determine O
the O
standards O
you O
live O
by O
. O
 
I O
m O
not O
sure O

in O
Ohio O
your O
grandmother O

crazy O

I O

so O
sorry O

Interesting O
about O

I O

Sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
the O
way O
you O
feel O
. O
I O
know O
its O
easier O
said O
than O
done O
but O
you O
need O
to O
find O
yourself O
something O
to O
distract O
you O
so O
you O
arent O
obsessing B-DIS
. O
something O
that O
engages O
your O
concentration O
and O
stimulates O
your O
mind O
. O
I O
like O
to O
swim O

baking O
go O
to O
the O
super O
market O

I O
am O
working O
on O
how O

me O
the O
low O

on O
some O
of O
the O
terminology O
you O
have O
used O
x O
 
you O
re O
doing O
great O
, O
keep O
it O
up O
sometimes O
it O
takes O
a O
health O
problem O
to O
wake O
up O
and O
say O
*I O
can O
do O
better* O
and O

Little O

When O
I O
hear O
a O
recovery O
story O
and O
someone O
says O
it O
was O
due O
to O
diet O
or O
exercise O

prayer O

probiotics O

removing O
sources O
of O
mould O

whatever O

sone O
people O
recover O

or O
they O
have O
a O
sub-type O
that O
only O
lasts O
a O
while O
, O
and O
whatever O
thing O
they O
did O
as O
they O
were O
recovering O
they O
attribute O
their O
recovery O
to O
. O
I O
read O
a O
book O
, O
50 O
recovery O
stories O
. O
There O
was O
no O
pattern O
to O
it O
. O
All O
I O
can O
draw O
from O
peoples O
stories O
is O
to O
not O
give O
up O
hope O
and O
try O
to O
stay O
as O
healthy O
as O
you O
can O
, O
mentally O

physically O

My O
Dr O
said O
often O
times O
autoimmune B-DIS
things I-DIS
come O
hand O
in O
hand O
so O
she O
did O
more O
blood O
work O
to O
test O
for O
lupus B-DIS
and O
a O
few O
other O
things O
. O
I O
have O
a O
feeling O
I O
will O
be O
sent O
to O
one O
soon O
. O
 
Probably O
depends O
on O
the O
job O
. O
I O
ve O
not O
had O
a O
job O
in O
a O
while O
where O
washroom O
trips O
would O
be O
noticed O
. O
But O
I O
can O
imagine O
some O
jobs O
would O
be O
impacted O
by O
too O
many O
breaks O
. O
Some O
people O
may O
advise O
against O
talking O
about O
it O
as O
it O
might O
invite O
discrimination O
but O
I O
ve O
always O
been O
able O
to O
work O
it O
out O
. O
One O
option O
is O
to O
get O
the O
offer O
and O
then O
disclose O
your O
problem O
before O
accepting O
. O
 
I O
have O
, O
but O
I O
assumed O
it O
was O
unrelated O
. O
Now O
you O
ve O
got O
me O
thinking O
... O
. O
 
My O
cats O
likes O
it O
 
I O
have O
no O
want O
to O
work O
. O
People O
always O
say O
to O
find O
a O
program O
career O
you O
enjoy O
, O
but O
I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
ll O
ever O
find O
anything O
I O
enjoy O
. O
 
I O
think O
this O
is O
normal O
, O
not O
just O
with O
people O
with O
BPD B-DIS
. O
We O
all O
tend O
to O
feel O
ignored O
when O
somebody O
doesn O
t O
reply O
. O
Honestly O
FB O
is O
the O
worst O
thing O
ever O
made O
in O
our O
generation O
. O
 
You O
can O
get O
an O
OmniPod O
demo O
kit O
to O
test O
out O
the O
adhesive O
That O
s O
what O
I O
did O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
, O
I O
don O
t O
have O
an O
answer O
for O
you O
as O
my O
insurance O
is O
taking O
its O
sweet O
time O
sorting O
this O
out O
. O
 
I O
do O
have O
some O
trouble O
with O
swallowing O
. O
I O
take O
my O
medication O
with O
applesauce O
, O
pudding O
or O
yogurt O
. O
With O
things O
like O
meats O
or O
breads O
, O
small O
bites O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
the O
reason O
for O
mine O
, O
but O
have O
just O
tried O
to O
make O
accommodations O
. O
 
Oh O
wow O
CS O
sounds O
like O
the O
worst O
job O
for O
a O
borderline O
indeed O
How O
do O
you O
not O
get O
a O
heart B-DIS
attack I-DIS
from O
rage O
everyday O
Hahaha O
 
Depression B-DIS
always O
seemed O
to O
me O
to O
be O
a O
lack B-DIS
of I-DIS
emotional I-DIS
energy I-DIS
. O
With O
CFS B-DIS
, O
using O
emotional O
energy O
can O
be O
as O
tiring O
as O
using O
physical O
energy O
, O
and O
when O
you O
re O
out O
, O
you O
re O
out O
 
Jarred O
Younger O
from O
UAB O
reporting O
on O
some O
initial O
findings O
looking O
at O
potential O
CFS B-DIS
subgroups O
. O
So O
far O
he O
s O
reporting O
on O
two O
subgroups O
where O
fatigue B-DIS
level O
correlates O
with O
an O
analyte O
in O
the O
blood O
, O
when O
taking O
daily O
blood O
samples O
. O
In O
one O
subgroup O
, O
fatigue B-DIS
tracks O
closely O
with O
CRP O
levels O
. O
He O
believes O
this O
could O
represent O
a O
persistent O
infection B-DIS
subgroup O
. O
In O
another O
subgroup O
he O
finds O
that O
fractalkine B-DRUG
chemokine O
CX3CL1 O
tracks O
with O
fatigue B-DIS
. O
He O
thinks O
this O
subgroup O
could O
be O
an O
autoimmune B-DIS
or O
inflammatory B-DIS
more O
than O
infection B-DIS
group O
. O
 
POTS B-DIS
is O
a O
lot O
more O
than O
just O
your O
pulse B-DIS
rising I-DIS
and I-DIS
falling I-DIS
, O
and O
usually O
when O
a O
person O
with O
POTS B-DIS
stands O
up O
, O
the O
heart B-DIS
rate I-DIS
goes I-DIS
up I-DIS
much O
higher O
, O
to O
the O
point O
where O
you O
have O
to O
sit O
back O
down O
to O
keep O
from O
passing B-DIS
out I-DIS
. O
This O
and O
the O
extreme B-DIS
drop I-DIS
in I-DIS
blood I-DIS
pressure I-DIS
are O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
POTS B-DIS
, O
or O
at O
least O
the O
main O
system O
. O
It O
basically O
effects O
everything O
your O
autonomic O
nervous O
system O
should O
be O
controlling O
. O
Because O
the O
signals O
that O
tell O
your O
vasculature O
in O
your O
lower O
limbs O
to O
tense O
up O
to O
maintain O
blood O
pressure O
, O
it O
drops O
quickly O
when O
you O
stand O
up O
. O
Another O
fun O
thing O
is O
when O
the O
blood B-DIS
pools I-DIS
in I-DIS
your I-DIS
lower I-DIS
legs I-DIS
and I-DIS
feet I-DIS
. O
A O
lot O
of O
people O
have O
to O
be O
very O
careful O
when O
first O
getting O
up O
in O
the O
morning O
to O
make O
sure O
their O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rates O
are O
safe O
enough O
to O
stand O
up O
without O
greying B-DIS
out I-DIS
. O
The O
heat O
only O
makes O
it O
worse O
, O
with O
the O
blood B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
getting I-DIS
lower I-DIS
, O
the O
heart B-DIS
rate I-DIS
getting I-DIS
higher I-DIS
, O
and O
constantly O
being O
out B-DIS
of I-DIS
breath I-DIS
. O
Then O
the O
fatigue B-DIS
, O
sore B-DIS
lower I-DIS
legs I-DIS
, O
being B-DIS
lightheaded I-DIS
, O
having O
to O
always O
make O
sure O
to O
scope O
out O
places O
to O
sit O
down O
in O
case O
you O
have O
a O
sudden B-DIS
drop I-DIS
in I-DIS
blood I-DIS
pressure I-DIS
. O
I O
once O
fell O
flat O
on O
my O
face O
on O
a O
concrete O
floor O
because O
I O
blacked B-DIS
out I-DIS
too O
fast O
to O
sit O
down O
. O
And O
the O
recovery O
time O
from O
any O
kind O
of O
strenuous O
activity O
during O
the O
summer O
can O
be O
up O
to O
two O
days O
. O
Not O
a O
fun O
syndrome O
 
Thank O
you O
. O
It O
is O
pretty O
upsetting O
, O
honestly O
. O
I O
mean O
, O
yeah O
, O
I O
guess O
me O
being O
a O
little O
needy O
and O
insecure O
up O
front O
is O
probably O
not O
so O
attractive O
, O
but O
he O
led O
to O
believe O
based O
on O
our O
previous O
interactions O
that O
it O
was O
okay O
to O
be O
open O
and O
honest O
. O
I O
equally O
shared O
SO O
MUCH O
about O
my O
life O
, O
so O
who O
s O
to O
say O
I O
don O
t O
have O
the O
equal O
right O
of O
pulling O
a O
fast O
one O
. O
I O
will O
say O
, O
he O
was O
cuddly O
up O
until O
announcing O
going O
to O
bed O
, O
but O
a O
simple O
, O
I O
m O
tired O
and O
not O
up O
for O
hanging O
out O
tonight O
would O
have O
been O
so O
simple O
rather O
than O
sitting O
in O
awkward O
silence O
for O
hours O
. O
He O
DID O
reply O
to O
me O
and O
was O
just O
as O
snarky O
and O
confusing O
. O
ME O
Hey O
, O
I O
don O
t O
know O
if O
you O
re O
busy O
or O
ignoring O
me O
or O
what O
. O
Not O
trying O
to O
be O
a O
crazy O
stage O
five O
clinger O
or O
anything O
, O
I O
m O
just O
really O
confused O
and O
not O
100 O
sure O
of O
what O
happened O
the O
other O
night O
or O
what O
I O
did O
wrong O
I O
know O
I O
drunk O
dialed O
you O
and O
you O
hung O
up O
; O
idk O
if O
I O
said O
something O
upseting O
or O
what O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
take O
you O
for O
the O
ghosting O
type O
. O
HIM O
I O
m O
not O
ghosting O
you O
. O
I O
pretty O
much O
slept O
all O
day O
yesterday O
, O
and O
yes O
, O
you O
did O
annoy O
me O
. O
ME O
Ahh O
I O
see O
. O
So O
... O
HIM O
So O
... O
what O
ME O
Are O
we O
cool O
Are O
you O
still O
interested O
in O
seeing O
me O
HIM O
We O
are O
cool O
. O
ME O
Thumbs O
up O
... O
Never O
responds O
... O
. O
... O
... O
... O
. O
On O
his O
end O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
it O
meant O
, O
on O
my O
end O
, O
I O
m O
not O
so O
sure O
I O
m O
cool O
with O
it O
 
. O
 
For O
me O
, O
its O
pain B-DIS
level O
10 O
or O
no O
pain B-DIS
at O
all O
. O
There O
s O
exactly O
no O
level O
of O
pain O
in O
between O
. O
But O
we O
are O
all O
different O
. O
If O
you O
have O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
your I-DIS
flank I-DIS
area I-DIS
, O
that O
s O
usually O
only O
one O
thing O
. O
Beware O
though O
-- O
Percocet B-DRUG
can O
jam B-DIS
up I-DIS
your I-DIS
bowels I-DIS
which O
can O
also O
feel O
similar O
but O
slightly O
different O
area O
. O
Good O
luck O
. O
 
Ya O
it O
is O
pretty O
goofy O
, O
I O
feel O
it O
when O
I O
think O
about O
playing O
a O
game O
or O
watching O
something O
I O
used O
to O
really O
like O
 
I O
smoke O
every O
day O
. O
I O
like O
to O
say O
a O
joint O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
a O
joint O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
Next O
thing O
you O
know O
I O
m O
smoking O
all O
day O
. O
Maybe O
it O
s O
me O
but O
addiction B-DIS
is O
addiction B-DIS
. O
 
Thank O
you O
, O
I O
will O
look O
it O
up O
. O
 
Can O
only O
really O
reiterate O
what O
u O
merrehgern O
has O
said O
. O
I O
get O
major B-DIS
depressive I-DIS
states I-DIS
also O
got O
BPD B-DIS
, O
chronic B-DIS
depression I-DIS
and O
paranoid B-DIS
anxiety I-DIS
and O
during O
them O
I O
don O
t O
feel O
like O
doing O
anything O
. O
I O
drink O
way O
too O
much O
but O
obviously O
that O
s O
NOT O
a O
good O
coping O
mechanism O
. O
As O
my O
alternatives O
I O
watch O
Netflix O
and O
YouTube O
and O
spend O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
on O
reddit O
I O
love O
r O
nosleep O
as O
a O
distraction O
. O
I O
can O
t O
really O
read O
books O
any O
more O
because O
of O
my O
lack B-DIS
of I-DIS
focus I-DIS
and I-DIS
motivation I-DIS
but O
short O
stories O
are O
perfect O
and O
before O
I O
know O
it O
I O
ve O
read O
like O
ten O
so O
I O
count O
that O
as O
reading O
. O
Also O
if O
I O
feel O
up O
to O
it O
, O
I O
have O
a O
quick O
shower O
and O
put O
on O
clean O
clothes O
. O
It O
really O
does O
help O
to O
feel O
cleaner O
. O
 
Do O
these O
channel B-DIS
abnormalities I-DIS
seen O
in O
vitro O
usually O
translate O
to O
in O
vivo O
studies O
My O
crude O
knowledge O
of O
the O
subject O
would O
suggest O
yes O
. O
 
Testosterone B-DRUG
replacement I-DRUG
therapy I-DRUG
. O
 
Is O
there O
a O
everything O
button O
 
Ah O
. O
I O
can O
see O
that O
. O
Facebook O
is O
very O
overrated O
in O
my O
opinion O
. O
Social O
media O
in O
general O
is O
not O
for O
everyone O
. O
How O
many O
people O
do O
you O
talk O
to O
in O
your O
daily O
life O
 
I O
ve O
taken O
it O
on O
and O
off O
, O
but O
I O
don O
t O
think O
it O
s O
made O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
at O
all O
 
Im O
afraid O
of O
people O
but O
im O
also O
lonely B-DIS
 
Sorry O
I O
should O
ve O
specified O
. O
I O
m O
very O
much O
IBS-C B-DIS
. O
I O
have O
to O
take O
magnesium B-DRUG
and O
restoralax B-DRUG
just O
go O
stay O
regular O
. O
 
This O
is O
a O
master O
piece O
, O
thanks O
for O
sharing O
it O
, O
I O
hope O
my O
suffering O
from O
bpd B-DIS
ends O
one O
day O
... O
 
I O
like O
this O
. O
I O
ll O
try O
to O
do O
this O
next O
time O
things O
get O
bad O
. O
 
Death O
, O
and O
knowing O
that O
you O
can O
just O
end O
it O
all O
at O
any O
moment O
you O
want O
, O
struck O
me O
as O
kind O
of O
comforting O
the O
other O
day O
. O
 
I O
think O
it O
s O
a O
pretty O
big O
deal O
in O
the O
US O
but O
I O
don O
t O
know O
if O
being O
in O
opinion O
section O
takes O
away O
from O
it O
. O
Maybe O
someone O
from O
US O
could O
tell O
us O
 
Something O
I O
learned O
in O
RO-DBT O
- O
the O
STOP O
skill O
. O
As O
my O
instructor O
literally O
described O
it O
to O
the O
class O
S O
- O
stands O
for O
Stop O
. O
Which O
means O
don O
t O
move O
. O
Don O
t O
think O
. O
Don O
t O
fucking O
do O
a O
single O
fucking O
thing O
. O
T O
- O
Take O
a O
long O
... O
Deepass O
breath O
. O
O O
- O
Observe O
what O
is O
going O
on O
in O
the O
current O
moment O
, O
non O
judgementally O
ok O
for O
me O
I O
just O
pause O
and O
imagine O
that O
whatevers O
going O
on O
is O
an O
early O
scene O
in O
a O
long O
movie O
and O
I O
m O
the O
main O
character O
and O
a O
Morgan O
freeman O
voiceover O
comes O
on O
narrating O
the O
situation O
in O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
Morgan O
freeman-y O
way O
, O
e. O
g. O
and O
it O
was O
at O
that O
moment O
, O
under O
the O
pressure O
of O
indescribable O
fear O
, O
Christina O
nearly O
contemplated O
suicide.. B-DIS
Although O
the O
truth O
was O
that O
her O
boss O
simply O
wanted O
her O
to O
etcetc O
for O
me O
the O
key O
thing O
is O
the O
narrations O
got O
ta O
be O
in O
past O
tense O
, O
implying O
the O
main O
character O
did O
overcome O
the O
battle O
against O
spiraling O
... O
Lol O
hopefully O
this O
long O
example O
made O
sense O
P O
- O
Proceed O
Mindfully O
I O
m O
pretty O
sure O
online O
sites O
may O
have O
a O
better O
description O
of O
this O
dbt O
STOP O
skill O
. O
Another O
skill O
that O
I O
used O
to O
love O
using O
back O
when O
my O
symptoms O
were O
bad O
too O
was O
the O
TIP O
skill O
. O
Can O
t O
recall O
exactly O
what O
each O
letter O
stood O
for O
but O
I O
know O
it O
included O
temperature O
change O
- O
aka O
I O
would O
get O
a O
bowl O
of O
ice O
and O
water O
and O
literally O
dump O
my O
face O
into O
it O
I O
shit O
you O
not O
and O
it O
would O
actually O
work O
. O
Saved O
me O
many O
a O
time O
from O
actually O
hurting O
myself O
during O
some O
of O
my O
worst O
worst O
worst O
moments O
. O
The O
science O
behind O
it O
is O
that O
the O
sudden O
temperature O
change O
shocks O
your O
central O
nervous O
system O
, O
which O
is O
involved O
in O
 
the O
symptoms O
of O
a O
lot O
of O
CNS B-DIS
brain B-DIS
diseases I-DIS
, O
such O
as O
anxiety B-DIS
or O
depression B-DIS
. O
Hope O
that O
helps O
Or O
at O
least O
gives O
u O
something O
to O
Google O
off O
of O
hit O
me O
up O
if O
any O
of O
this O
was O
confusing.. O
Lol O
I O
wrote O
this O
at O
7am O
ish O
and O
I O
think O
this O
is O
my O
first O
big O
reddit O
post O
ever O
 
The O
first O
year O
of O
my O
CFS B-DIS
was O
the O
worst O
, O
I O
was O
mostly O
bedbound B-DIS
then O
. O
My O
doctors O
have O
said O
that O
you O
recover O
over O
time O
. O
I O
have O
had O
improvements O
and O
I O
don O
t O
take O
supplements O
or O
anything O
, O
sometimes O
I O
get O
crashes B-DIS
too O
for O
seemingly O
no O
reason O
. O
How O
long O
have O
you O
been O
ill O
If O
you O
had O
mono B-DIS
it O
can O
knock O
people O
out O
for O
a O
year O
. O
I O
know O
two O
people O
that O
had O
to O
leave O
university O
and O
work O
to O
recover O
from O
it O
and O
are O
healthy O
people O
now O
. O
This O
past O
year O
research O
has O
started O
to O
get O
really O
promising O
, O
so O
we O
do O
have O
hope O
for O
actual O
evidence O
based O
treatment O
in O
the O
future O
. O
You O
can O
look O
up O
the O
Rituximab B-DRUG
trail O
in O
Norway O
. O
It O
is O
an O
exciting O
time O
Australia O
, O
USA O
, O
and O
Norway O
have O
all O
had O
studies O
recently O
that O
had O
interesting O
findings O
pointing O
towards O
bio-markers O
or O
possible O
mechanisms O
behind O
CFS B-DIS
. O
 
I O
bedazzled O
a O
daily O
pill O
box O
with O
those O
tiny O
puffy O
Japanese O
animal O

It O
s O
so O
cute O

It O

its O
primary O

Those O

Thanks O
That O

great O
to O

I O
m O
failing O
Entyvio B-DRUG

my O

I O

but O
I O
ve O
isolated B-DIS
and O
been O
stuck O
in O
my O
own O
head O
for O
so O
long O
my O
natural O
reaction O
is O
to O
figure O
out O
how O
what O
is O
being O
said O
relates O
to O
me O
. O
 
Canadian O
in O
NB O
I O
really O
wish O
there O
was O
a O
group O
because O
trying O
to O
get O
help O
has O
been O
such O
a O
battle O
No O
idea O
what O
kind O
of O
POTS B-DIS
I O
have O
tho O
. O
 
I O
have O
the O
same O
feeling O
. O
It O
s O
sad O
we O
can O
not O
control O
what O
should O
happen O
in O
life O
. O
Problem O
like O
that O
can O
not O
be O
solved O
by O
advice O
IMO O
. O
Thats O
why O
, O
I O
just O
hope O
LUCK O
or O
miracle O
or O
amazing O
weird O
thing O
happens O
. O
But O
still O
, O
this O
world O
is O
unfair O
to O
begin O
with O
... O
 
Exercise O
, O
water O
and O
fiber O
. O
It O
took O
me O
a O
while O
to O
figure O
out O
the O
right O
amount O
of O
fiber O
to O
allow O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
without O
aggravating O
the O
gp B-DIS
or O
constipation B-DIS
. O
 
... O
find O
a O
diet O
way O
of O
eating O
, O
not O
weight O
loss O
that O
works O
for O
you O
, O
take O
prescribed O
medication O
, O
and O
know O
you O
aren O
t O
alone O
. O
 
An O
app O
like O
this O
would O
probably O
help O
people O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
dementia B-DIS
Alzheimer O
s O
, O
but O
as O
the O
disease O
progresses O
to O
the O
middle O
and O
late O
stages O
, O
people O
suffering O
with O
the O
disease O
wouldn O
t O
be O
able O
to O
remember O
where O
the O
phone O
iPad O
is O
, O
much O
less O
how O
to O
navigate O
through O
an O
app O
. O
You O
might O
want O
to O
focus O
your O
efforts O
on O
the O
early O
stages O
. O
 
Nope.. O
No O
rapid O
acting O
can O
get O
gotten O
without O
a O
prescription O
, O
FDA O
rules O
. O
Yes O
, O
it O
refers O
to O
how O
long O
the O
insulin B-DRUG
stays O
active O
when O
you O
bolus O
. O
Most O
modern O
pumps O
will O
take O
this O
into O
account O
when O
you O
already O
have O
insulin B-DRUG
that O
is O
still O
active O
in O
your O
system O
. O
It O
is O
called O
stacking O
calculations O
. O
You O
will O
also O
have O
to O
adjust O
a O
bit O
to O
how O
your O
BG O
will O
rise O
a O
bit O
after O
a O
meal O
because O
of O
the O
onset O
time O
difference O
of O
the O
bolus O
. O
 
Yeah O
. O
He O
s O
so O
overburdened O
right O
now O
that O
I O
think O
he O
just O
doesn O
t O
want O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
. O
It O
s O
unfortunate O
because O
this O
care O
worker O
is O
not O
great O
but O
I O
don O
t O
want O
to O
put O
more O
pressure O
on O
him O
 
I O
heard O
the O
Lantus B-DRUG
patent O
just O
did O
or O
is O
near O
expiring O
. O
Is O
Basaglar B-DRUG
the O
first O
of O
hopefully O
more O
Lantus B-DRUG
alternatives O
 
You O
should O
definitely O
see O
your O
doctor O
about O
this O
asap O
. O
That O
s O
probably O
too O
much O
water O
. O
I O
felt O
the O
same O
right O
before O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
gestational B-DIS
diabetes I-DIS
. O
 
No O
problem O
The O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
to O
make O
sure O
the O
jeans O
are O
not O
tight O
in O
the O
waist O
and O
crotch O
area O
. O
I O
have O
a O
couple O
pairs O
of O
skinny O
jeans O
that O
I O
can O
still O
wear O
that O
are O
loose O
enough O
in O
those O
areas O
that O
it O
doesn O
t O
cause O
me O
pain B-DIS
. O
And O
yes O
, O
I O
actually O
used O
an O
aquarium O
pH O
testing O
strip O
lol O
 
I O
m O
on O
my O
4th O
year O
now O
. O
It O
s O
been O
a O
rough O
ride O
. O
I O
find O
out O
lost O
of O
marijuana B-DRUG
and O
strict O
regiment O
of O
domperidone B-DRUG
lets O
me O
eat O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
most O
people O
with O
GP B-DIS
can O
t. O
Only O
issue O
I O
have O
to O
figure O
out O
now O
is O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
anxiety B-DIS
that O
came O
with O
this O
fucking O
stomach B-DIS
disease I-DIS
. O
I O
use O
to O
be O
able O
to O
rock O
climb O
20ft O
boulders O
with O
no O
ropes O
no O
problem O
. O
Now O
I O
can O
t O
even O
go O
on O
a O
date O
without O
getting O
extremely B-DIS
nervous I-DIS
and O
sometimes O
throwing B-DIS
up I-DIS
before O
hand O
. O
 
Phew O
, O
this O
is O
a O
difficult O
one O
and O
I O
truly O
think O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
person O
you O
re O
talking O
to O
and O
how O
they O
feel O
about O
death O
and O
dying O
. O
Some O
people O
are O
scared O
, O
don O
t O
want O
to O
accept O
it O
will O
ever O
happen O
to O
them O
even O
they O
do O
know O
that O
everybody O
will O
, O
one O
day O
, O
die O
because O
that O
s O
what O
people O
do O
. O
I O
think O
you O
truly O
have O
to O
behave O
in O
a O
way O
that O
matches O
the O
person O
, O
even O
if O
it O
means O
hiding O
the O
truth O
from O
them O
. O
Some O
untruths O
are O
good O
ones O
. O
One O
relative O
was O
in O
a O
hospice O
for O
the O
last O
few O
weeks O
of O
her O
life O
yet O
wouldn O
t O
accept O
she O
was O
dying O
and O
was O
scared O
of O
dying O
. O
It O
would O
have O
been O
more O
upsetting O
for O
her O
to O
have O
known O
how O
long O
than O
to O
be O
in O
ignorance O
, O
to O
have O
pain O
medication O
and O
to O
slip O
away O
in O
her O
sleep O
. O
Another O
relative O
was O
fiercely O
determined O
not O
to O
die O
, O
ever O
, O
even O
though O
he O
had O
terminal B-DIS
liver I-DIS
cancer I-DIS
and O
made O
no O
arrangements O
or O
told O
anybody O
his O
wishes O
. O
He O
was O
at O
home O
until O
very O
few O
hours O
before O
he O
left O
us O
, O
it O
was O
as O
if O
going O
into O
hospital O
gave O
him O
permission O
to O
go O
. O
The O
same O
, O
sort O
of O
, O
happened O
with O
another O
relative O
whose O
family O
let O
her O
know O
she O
could O
go O
whenever O
she O
wanted O
, O
and O
that O
s O
just O
what O
she O
did O
. O
My O
MiL O
, O
who O
has O
Alzheimer B-DIS
s O
, O
is O
fairly O
convinced O
she O
is O
going O
to O
live O
for O
ever O
and O
didn O
t O
even O
want O
to O
make O
a O
will O
or O
organise O
power O
of O
attorney O
in O
case O
it O
meant O
she O
would O
die O
tomorrow O
. O
My O
father O
was O
the O
same O
- O
no O
will O
, O
as O
if O
he O
thought O
it O
meant O
he O
would O
die O
soon O
after O
making O
one O
 
. O
*edit O
I O
do O
have O
a O
large O
extended O
family O
. O
* O
 
Well O
, O
cauliflower O
is O
listed O
as O
a O
high O
FODMAP O
item O
, O
so O
that O
might O
explain O
your O
problem O
. O
 
Some O
schools O
have O
tutoring O
centers O
that O
can O
help O
you O
out O
in O
situations O
like O
this O
. O
Something O
to O
think O
about O
. O
 
Would O
have O
to O
be O
12hr O
plus O
Id O
imagine O
. O
8hour O
sleeps O
aren O
t O
enough O
to O
noticeably O
affect O
most O
people O
. O
 
I O
haven O
t O
pushed O
the O
dehydration B-DIS
limits O
too O
much O
since O
buying O
it O
but O
if O
I O
m O
slightly B-DIS
dehydrated I-DIS
120s B-DIS
130s B-DIS
is O
expected O
. O
If O
I O
keep O
up O
with O
nutritious O
meals O
and O
my O
fluids O
I O
can O
be O
in O
the O
90s O
sometimes O
when O
I O
m O
on O
my O
feet O
. O
Before O
I O
had O
the O
polar B-DIS
h7 I-DIS
and O
I O
was O
really O
dehydrated B-DIS
I O
was O
flirting O
with O
180 O
. O
 
Perhaps O
you O
are O
absorbing O
insulin B-DRUG
better O
on O
the O
Omnipod B-DRUG
. O
I O
would O
dial O
back O
the O
basals O
. O
 
I O
also O
have O
IBS-D B-DIS
and O
have O
found O
a O
1 O
1 O
ratio O
of O
thc O
cbd O
to O
be O
ideal O
for O
pain O
. O
I O
use O
an O
arizer B-DRUG
solo I-DRUG
vape I-DRUG
on O
its O
medium O
temperature O
range O
. O
I O
also O
have O
GERD B-DIS
and O
find O
that O
smoking O
will O
cause O
the O
reflux B-DIS
to O
worsten O
. O
 
Luckily O
I O
could O
use O
a O
little O
weight O
. O
 
Things O
really O
got O
better O
for O
me O
with O
changing O
what O
how O
I O
ate O
and O
meds O
. O
Compared O
to O
my O
other O
health O
issues O
, O
it O
s O
not O
really O
limiting O
my O
life O
. O
My O
eating O
habits O
are O
definitely O
different O
from O
other O
people O
, O
but O
not O
in O
a O
bad O
way O
. O
I O
have O
flare B-DIS
ups I-DIS
now O
and O
then O
that O
suck O
, O
but O
for O
the O
most O
part O
the O
pain B-DIS
and O
nausea B-DIS
just O
go O
into O
the O
background O
and O
seem O
normal O
. O
All O
chronic B-DIS
illnesses I-DIS
seem O
worse O
at O
first O
. O
Don O
t O
look O
at O
this O
could O
be O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
because O
that O
would O
make O
anyone O
freak O
out O
. O
Just O
take O
things O
day O
by O
day O
. O
If O
you O
are O
in O
a O
crisis O
, O
get O
stabilized O
then O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
eat O
without O
getting O
too O
stick O
and O
know O
what O
you O
can O
take O
when O
the O
pain B-DIS
and O
nausea B-DIS
get O
over O
what O
you O
can O
tolerate O
. O
Physical O
activity O
helps O
a O
lot O
, O
especially O
going O
on O
a O
walk O
after O
eating O
. O
You O
ll O
make O
it O
through O
. O
Most O
people O
I O
know O
see O
a O
big O
reduction O
in O
symptoms O
within O
a O
few O
years O
so O
that O
s O
something O
to O
look O
forward O
to O
as O
well O
. O
 
the O
way O
I O
have O
started O
to O
think O
of O
it O
is O
to O
say O
basically O
like O
... O
when O
the O
person O
with O
CFS B-DIS
body O
tries O
to O
create O
more O
than O
a O
certain O
threshold O
of O
energy O
which O
varies O
over O
time O
and O
the O
individual O
but O
generally O
its O
something O
between O
1 O
severe O
to O
25 O
mild O
of O
a O
normal O
persons O
energy O
output O
, O
if O
it O
exceeds O
that O
threshold O
then O
the O
body O
starts O
to O
poison O
itself O
, O
if O
they O
ask O
why O
then O
I O
would O
say O
its O
because O
the O
metabolism O
is O
recalibrated O
, O
probably O
due O
to O
a O
defective B-DIS
immune I-DIS
system I-DIS
. O
If O
I O
had O
try O
to O
explain O
depression B-DIS
to O
someone O
I O
would O
struggle O
though O
 
Could O
be O
gastritis B-DIS
. O
This O
is O
almost O
the O
same O
as O
my O
symptoms O
. O
And O
I O
too O
had O
the O
pancreas O
being O
obscured O
due O
to O
gas O
. O
Had O
a O
CT O
scan O
and O
pancreas O
levels O
blood O
test O
to O
make O
sure O
and O
all O
looked O
fine O
. O
Also O
had O
terrible O
constipation B-DIS
leading O
to O
hemerroids B-DIS
which O
was O
why O
i O
saw O
blood O
now O
and O
then O
. O
But O
they O
put O
me O
on O
omeprazole B-DRUG
and O
I O
practiced O
meditation O
as O
well O
as O
exercise O
and O
after O
2 O
or O
3 O
months O
, O
the O
symptoms O
eased O
. O
My O
liver O
wasn O
t O
fatty O
though O
... O
although O
it O
is O
slightly O
highly O
functioning O
, O
possibly O
a O
result O
of O
glandular O
fever O
 
I O
feel O
you O
with O
the O
weight O
gain O
I O
ve O
been O
there O
and O
am O
struggling O
now O
too O
. O
I O
m O
always O
mad O
because O
the O
ONLy O
good O
thing O
about O
being O
sick O
is O
I O
loose O
weight O
which O
obviously O
isn O
t O
healthy O
and O
then O
I O
go O
on O
prednisone O
and O
gain O
way O
more O
weight O
then O
I O
lost O
 
I O
can O
not O
offer O
any O
advice O
from O
direct O
experience O
as O
my O
loved O
one O
is O
only O
in O
the O
very O
early O
stages O
of O
dementia B-DIS
. O
However O
, O
have O
just O
found O
this O
sub O
and O
have O
decided O
I O
am O
going O
to O
try O
to O
participate O
when O
possible O
because O
I O
can O
see O
this O
could O
be O
a O
powerful O
support O
place O
. O
Its O
my O
hope O
that O
others O
on O
this O
sub O
try O
to O
offer O
help O
in O
their O
responses O
as O
well O
. O
Its O
not O
much O
, O
but O
check O
this O
link O
out O
as O
a O
starting O
place O
... O
 
It O
s O
a O
natural O
bodily O
function O
and O
to O
be O
expected O
in O
close O
quarters O
such O
as O
with O
spooning O
. O
Those O
who O
don O
t O
understand O
that O
or O
would O
not O
be O
able O
to O
control O
themselves O
when O
it O
happens O
either O
gender O
are O
not O
mature O
enough O
for O
that O
sub O
or O
any O
other O
group O
like O
it O
. O
Saying O
you O
don O
t O
have O
enough O
self O
control O
for O
it O
sounds O
like O
you O
re O
saying O
if O
you O
get O
a O
boner O
then O
you O
would O
try O
to O
take O
it O
further O
, O
and O
that O
s O
not O
what O
a O
cuddle O
buddy O
is O
for O
, O
and O
the O
context O
of O
you O
saying O
that O
sounds O
rapey O
, O
for O
lack O
of O
a O
better O
term O
. O
So O
yeah O
, O
you O
should O
avoid O
close O
contact O
with O
people O
until O
you O
can O
act O
mature O
and O
control O
your O
urges O
. O
 
Yeah O
, O
electrolyte B-DIS
imbalances I-DIS
can O
**really** O
mess O
you O
up O
. O
I O
had O
low B-DIS
potassium I-DIS
before O
from O
puking B-DIS
that O
made O
me O
go O
unconscious B-DIS
, O
it O
was O
pretty O
nuts O
. O
The O
hospital O
had O
to O
give O
me O
potassium O
in O
an O
IV O
and O
then O
suddenly O
I O
was O
ok O
. O
 
Have O
you O
tried O
a O
elimination B-DRUG
diet I-DRUG
Maybe O
if O
you O
re O
sensitive B-DIS
to I-DIS
gluten I-DIS
you O
re O
sensitive B-DIS
to I-DIS
grains I-DIS
all O
together O
Or O
maybe O
dairy O
is O
the O
culprit O
 
Thank O
you O
, O
I O
ve O
definitely O
been O
trying O
to O
remind O
them O
they O
won O
t O
lose O
me O
. O
 
Is O
it O
fair O
to O
ask O
if O
those O
reporting O
success O
had O
an O
actual O
virus B-DIS
I O
m O
quite O
curious O
ie O
. O
desperate O
for O
a O
remedy O
, O
but O
have O
no O
viral B-DIS
condition I-DIS
that O
I O
m O
aware O
of O
... O
 
thank O
you O
 
If O
you O
re O
writing O
, O
you O
should O
write O
1-3 O
pages O
of O
text O
. O
It O
s O
best O
to O
call O
though O
. O
One O
phone O
call O
is O
worth O
ten O
mailed O
letters O
. O
One O
mailed O
letter O
is O
worth O
fifty O
emails O
. O
So O
it O
takes O
about O
five O
hundred O
emails O
to O
have O
the O
impact O
that O
one O
phone O
call O
can O
. O
Tell O
your O
story O
to O
the O
person O
who O
picks O
up O
the O
phone O
. O
Call O
people O
on O
the O

that O
are O
relevant O
. O
Start O
at O
your O
district O
level O

then O
state O

then O

Besides O
extreme B-DIS
fatigue I-DIS
, O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
. O
All O
the O
medication O
I O
m O
on O
has O
drowsiness B-DIS
as O
a O
side O
effect O
and O
I O
constantly O
feel O
tired O
. O
I O
could O
sleep O
all O
day O
, O
but O
sleeping O
provides O
no O
relief O
. O
It O
s O
just O
a O
weird O
purgatory O
of O
extreme B-DIS
tiredness I-DIS
right O
now O
. O
 
thanks O
 
I O
had O
something O
similar O
. O
It O
began O
with O
my O
muscles B-DIS
twitching I-DIS
a O
bit O
now O
and O
then O
, O
then O
it O
got O
slowly O
worse O
, O
twitching B-DIS
more I-DIS
and I-DIS
more I-DIS
often I-DIS
, O
and O
after O
some O
months O
it O
was O
less B-DIS
of I-DIS
a I-DIS
twitch I-DIS
and I-DIS
more I-DIS
of I-DIS
a I-DIS
jerk I-DIS
. O
My O
leg B-DIS
sometimes I-DIS
would I-DIS
just I-DIS
start I-DIS
kicking I-DIS
away I-DIS
when O
I O
was O
lying O
in O
bed O
. O
That O
wasn O
t O
a O
lot O
of O
fun O
... O
In O
my O
case O
, O
though O
, O
the O
solution O
was O
rather O
simple O
, O
it O
was O
a O
magnesium B-DIS
deficiency I-DIS
that O
had O
just O
gotten O
worse O
and O
worse O
until O
I O
had O
trouble B-DIS
walking I-DIS
. O
Now O
, O
I O
just O
take O
400mg O
magnesium O
daily O
and O
it O
works O
like O
a O
charm O
, O
the O
twitching B-DIS
s O
gone O
and O
, O
as O
a O
bonus O
, O
some O
of O
the O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
muscles I-DIS
as O
well O
. O
I O
remember O
reading O
posts O
on O
Phoenix O
Rising O
from O
members O
with O
similar O
problems O
, O
a O
magnesium B-DIS
deficiency I-DIS
with O
accompanying O
twitches B-DIS
and O
jerks B-DIS
seems O
to O
be O
a O
rather O
common O
symptom O
. O
You O
could O
take O
a O
supplement B-DRUG
, O
it O
s O
worth O
a O
try O
at O
least O
. O
Though O
involuntary B-DIS
muscle I-DIS
spasm I-DIS
can O
really O
have O
a O
lot O
reasons O
, O
for O
example O
neurological B-DIS
damage I-DIS
due O
to O
an O
infection B-DIS
like O
Lyme B-DIS
or O
something O
like O
that O
, O
as O
well O
as O
a O
ton O
of O
neurological B-DIS
disorders I-DIS
. O
 
I O
m O
sorry O
man O
. O
I O
have O
no O
advice O
to O
give O
that O
s O
better O
than O
any O
of O
the O
above O
. O
Just O
wanted O
to O
say O
good O
luck O
and O
stick O
with O
it O
. O
Constipation B-DIS
is O
a O
constant O
misery O
that O
those O
who O
haven O
t O
suffered O
it O
badly O
underestimate O
. O
If O
you O
re O
feeling O
suicidal B-DIS
, O
please O
get O
support O
from O
friends O
, O
family O
or O
a O
professional O
. O
Don O
t O
try O
and O
deal O
with O
it O
on O
your O
own O
. O
If O
you O
speak O
to O
someone O
, O
they O
will O
help O
and O
support O
you O
. O
 
Such O
an O
accurate O
description O
of O
my O
symptoms O
. O
Now O
there O
is O
a O
connection O
I O
can O
t O
quite O
explain O
. O
This O
seems O
also O
to O
be O
correlated O
to O
stomach B-DIS
discomfort I-DIS
for O
me O
. O
And O
when O
I O
tried O
a O
complement O
which O
is O
HCl B-DRUG
to O
help O
with O
digestion O
, O
bad O
idea O
for O
me O
, O
I O
created O
one O
of O
these O
episode O
tachycardia B-DIS
at O
rest O

These O
always O
spoke O
me O
out O

Nothing O
was O
found O
with O
the O
holster O
. O
 
Are O
you O
really O
asking O
me O
to O
explain O
not O
wanting O
to O
do O
anything O
When O
I O
say O
there O
is O
nothing O
you O
want O
to O
do O
. O
I O
mean O
, O
quite O
simply O
, O
that O
no O
activity O
or O
action O
has O
any O
appeal O
. O
As O
a O
result O
of O
this O
some O
people O
do O
stay O
in O
bed O
, O
as O
you O
mentioned O
. O
Others O
might O
sit O
on O
reddit O
reading O
threads O
they O
aren O
t O
overly O
interested O
in O
. O
The O
reason O
people O
do O
these O
things O
is O
usually O
because O
it O
s O
an O
established O
routine O
, O
not O
due O
to O
any O
desire O
to O
engage O
in O
that O
activity O
. O
 
I O
still O
feel O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
side I-DIS
and I-DIS
back I-DIS
, O
is O
that O
normal O
 
Isn O

that O

then O
WHAM O

Corolation O
and O

if O
whatever O

I O
don O

when O

A O

I O

When O
I O
m O
feeling O
negative O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
lost O
my O
life O
20 O
years O

but O
my O
body O

just O
too O
stupid O
to O
figure O
it O
out O

I O
m O
not O
generally O
depressed B-DIS

that O

I O
did O
the O
23andMe O
Promethease O
thing O
after O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
in O
2015 O
. O
No O
surprise O
I O
had O
lots O
of O
the O
bad O
genetic O
markers O
for O
Crohn O
s. O
But O
I O
also O
had O
bad O
genetic O
markers O
sometimes O
bunches O
of O
them O
for O
things O
I O
definitely O
don O
t O
have O
. O
It O
s O
fun O
to O
look O
through O
those O
reports O
and O
see O
what O
crazy O
genes O
you O
carry O
, O
but O
I O
definitely O
wouldn O
t O
put O
too O
much O
stock O
in O
it O
. O
If O
you O
think O
you O
have O
Crohn O
s O
, O
the O
best O
way O
to O
find O
out O
is O
with O
a O
colonoscopy O
. O
 
Interstitial B-DIS
cystitis I-DIS
is O
not O
regular O
cystitis B-DIS
. O
IC B-DIS
is O
not O
usually O
bacterial O
. O
Cranberry O
is O
off O
limits O
on O
the O
IC B-DIS
diet O
. O
Not O
sure O
if O
you O
realise O
the O
difference O
 
I O
dab O
concentrates O
like O
a O
mofo O
. O
It O
helps O
out O
immensely O
with O
hunger B-DIS
and O
nausea B-DIS
and O
pain B-DIS
. O
Unfortunately O
I O
ve O
tried O
cutting O
out O
the O
meds O
and O
it O
doesn O
t O
work O
for O
me O
. O
I O
need O
to O
be O
on O
a O
prescription O
dose O
of O
prevacid B-DRUG
and O
I O
m O
on O
50mg O
of O
domperidone B-DRUG
a O
day O
. O
With O
that O
combo O
I O
eat O
solid O
foods O
95 O
of O
the O
time O
. O
I O
wouldn O
t O
say O
I O
have O
a O
light O
case O
of O
GP B-DIS
since O
if O
I O
m O
off O
my O
meds O
and O
don O
t O
smoke O
I O
go O
down O
hill O
REAL O
QUICK O
. O
I O
m O
just O
lucky O
I O
found O
an O
effective O
way O
to O
manage O
it O
... O
which O
isn O
t O
full O
proof O
. O
I O
do O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
problems O
with O
the O
way O
I O
eat O

I O
m O
just O
stubborn O

Thank O
you O
all O
so O
much O
, O
for O
your O
feedback O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
have O
some O
more O
clarity O
and O
hope O
. O
I O
have O
an O
appointment O
with O
an O
OBGYN O
, O
but O
after O
seeing O
this O
I O
want O
to O
go O
to O
an O
endocrinologist O
. O
Do O
you O
guys O
think O
this O
would O
be O
better O
to O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
A O
lot O
of O
what O
you O
have O
said O
is O
so O
relatable O
to O
me O
, O
I O
just O
thought O
I O
had O
a O
bunch O
of O
separate O
issues O
, O
but O
perhaps O
they O
are O
all O
connected O
. O
I O
will O
definitely O
check O
out O
the O
book O
. O
Of O
course O
, O
I O
had O
no O
idea O
which O
tests O
I O
needed O
to O
be O
done O
, O
I O
had O
specifically O
asked O
for O
her O
to O
test O
my O
thyroid B-DIS
so O
I O
m O
kinda O
upset O
she O
didn O
t O
do O
my O
free O
T3 O
. O
I O
will O
check O
out O
that O
book O
thanks O
for O
the O
recommendation O
, O
and O
try O
to O
do O
some O
more O
research O
on O
hypothyroidism B-DIS
since O
I O
am O
relatively O
ignorant O
on O
the O
topic O
. O
 
There O
is O
0 O
food O
coloring O
or O
fake O
additives O
. O
Not O
great O
but O
slightly O
better O
; O
 
Make O
sure O
it O
s O
just O
the O
painkiller O
Azo B-DRUG
, O
and O
nothing O
with O
cranberries O
in O
it O
. O
 
I O
hope O
so O
. O
I O
m O
driving O
myself O
and O
my O
husband O
crazy O
. O
 
Those O
are O
cute O
Any O
inspiration O
in O
particular O
 
Oh O
geez O
I O
m O
glad O
you O
made O
it O
. O
I O
went O
to O
Disney O
a O
couple O
of O
years O
ago O
and O
was O
completely O
unable O
to O
enjoy O
it O
the O
crowds O
made O
me O
nervous O
about O
finding O
bathrooms O
being O
a O
line O
. O
I O
don O
t O
have O
a O
weird O
one O
exactly O
. O
I O
did O
have O
one O
particularly O
awful O
flareup B-DIS
while O
on O
a O
subway O
between O
stops O
I O
ended O
up O
having O
to O
take O
a O
random O
stop O
and O
frantically O
find O
a O
bathroom O
. O
Not O
a O
good O
day O
haha O
 
Just O
FYI O
that O
s O
actually O
a O
couple O
years O
worth O
of O
syringes O
. O
 
You O
should O
get O
your O
stomach O
checked O
, O
though O
. O
That O
hollow O
feeling O
can O
be O
an O
early O
symptom O
of O
stomach B-DIS
ulcers I-DIS
. O
 
I O
do O
already O
have O
a O
fainting B-DIS
condition I-DIS
and O
it O
s O
so O
misunderstood O
and O
unknown O
because O
it O
happens O
during O
non O
stressful O
, O
calm O
times O
also O
that O
it O
very O
well O
could O
play O
into O
what O
s O
causing O
the O
vertigo B-DIS
. O
There O
are O
a O
ton O
of O
people O
that O
have O
the O
faints B-DIS
that O
I O
do O
without O
vertigo B-DIS
however O
, O
but O
who O
even O
knows O
at O
this O
point O
. O
If O
it O
is O
connected O
in O
anyway O
, O
it O
just O
pushes O
my O
guess O
to O
be O
more O
of O
neurological O
condition O
that O
is O
causing O
the O
black B-DIS
outs I-DIS
. O
It O
s O
hard O
enough O
getting O
a O
doctor O
to O
do O
anything O
for O
me O
in O
regards O
to O
the O
fainting B-DIS
, O
let O
alone O
one O
that O
would O
actually O
try O
to O
see O
if O
it O
s O
causing O
my O
other O
issues O
. O
 
My O
fatigue B-DIS
, O
weakness B-DIS
, O
balance B-DIS
, O
clumsiness B-DIS
gets O
worse O
that O
week O
, O
especially O
before O
. O
I O
usually O
don O
t O
schedule O
anything O
for O
that O
week O
if O
I O
can O
help O
it O
. O
Usually O
an O
exacerbation O
is O
the O
temporary O
return O
of O
old O
MS B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
. O
So O
if O
your O
pain B-DIS
cramps B-DIS
came O
about O
from O
an O
MS B-DIS
attack I-DIS
, O
then O
it O
makes O
sense O
that O
they O
would O
come O
back O
for O
a O
brief O
time O
. O
 
You O
and O
OP O
are O
probably O
experiencing O
symptoms O
due O
to O
a O
goiter B-DIS
. O
It O
s O
easily O
treatable O
, O
but O
should O
still O
be O
discussed O
with O
your O
dr O
 
Ha O
Sorry O
about O
that O
- O
CSA O
stands O
for O
community O
supported O
agriculture O
, O
which O
basically O
means O
you O
support O
local O
farms O
by O
buying O
a O
season O
s O
worth O
of O
produce O
up O
front O
, O
and O
it O
s O
ready O
for O
you O
each O
week O
at O
your O
local O
farmer O
s O
market O
. O
 
Those O
are O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
concerns O
. O
He O
just O
wants O
something O
that O
works O
. O
With O
this O
study O
he O
would O
have O
a O
7 O
in O
8 O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
drug O
. O
I O
get O
the O
impression O
the O
doc O
is O
thinking O
of O
their O
best O
interests O
rather O
than O
my O
husband O
s O
but O
we O
wanted O
another O
opinion O
as O
switching O
dermatologists O
can O
be O
a O
long O
process O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
input O
The O
only O
benefit O
is O
they O
would O
pay O
my O
husband O
, O
rather O
than O
us O
paying O
for O
meds O
. O
But O
we O
do O
have O
insurance O
to O
pay O
for O
any O
other O
meds O
. O
 
Are O
you O
able O
to O
get O
CGM B-DRUG
Starting O
CGM O
took O
care O
of O
my O
burnout B-DIS
. O
 
I O
asked O
for O
help O
and O
some O
of O
the O
audience O
banged O
rhythm O
for O
me O
. O
I O
played O
slower O
simpler O
songs O
. O
I O
need O
to O
remember O
to O
collaborate O

them O

I O

to O
me O
. O
I O
hesitated O
to O
buy O
his O
book O
because O
I O
didn O
t O
want O
to O
spend O
on O
yet O
another O
thing O
that O
doesn O
t O
help O
, O
but O
boy O
was O
the O
book O
fascinating O
and O
helped O
me O
identify O
so O
many O
puzzle O
pieces O
in O
my O
symptoms O
. O
POTS B-DIS
and O
MCAS B-DIS
are O
common O
together O
. O
 
Finished O
uni O
yay O
, O
got O
a O
bit O
too O
fat O
though O
so O
now O
I O
have O
to O
lose O
20lbs O
and O
a O
massive B-DIS
flare I-DIS
up I-DIS
from O
hiking O
three O
volcanoes O
in O
three O
days O
last O
week O
. O
Damn O
uni O
. O
 
The O
sleep O
doctor O
wants O
to O
rerun O
the O
test O
but O
I O
don O
t O
have O
the O
money O
to O
do O
it O
and O
the O
waiting O
time O
is O
1 O
year O
. O
On O
my O
last O
test O
I O
only O
managed O
to O
sleep O
2 O
hours O
and O
didn O
t O
sleep O
at O
all O
the O
next O
day O
, O
my O
MSLT O
was O
negative O
for O
narcolepsy B-DIS
, O
I O
was O
entering O
stage O
1 O
and O
2 O
sleep O
quite O
quickly O
but O
never B-DIS
entered I-DIS
REM I-DIS
. O
 
you O
never O
know O
. O
could O
go O
either O
way O
. O
 
Sorry O
for O
the O
late O
response O
. O
I O
think O
it O
depends O
on O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
. O
I O
wear O
a O
HA B-DRUG
in O
my O
left O
ear O
and O
that O
solves O
most O
of O
my O
problems O
some O
difficulty B-DIS
with I-DIS
word I-DIS
recognition I-DIS
at O
times O
. O
I O
would O
do O
whatever O
it O
takes O
to O
maintain O
communication O
. O
A O
close O
friend O
is O
a O
speech O
therapist O
and O
she O
related O
that O
hearing B-DIS
impaired I-DIS
people O
tend O
to O
become O
isolated O
and O
also O
are O
more O
prone B-DIS
to I-DIS
dementia I-DIS
. O
I O
can O
see O
this O
happening O
. O
Before O
my O
HA O
if O
we O
were O
in O
an O
environment O
with O
lots O
of O
background O
noise O
, O
like O
a O
bar O
restaurant O
, O
I O
couldn O
t O
understand O
80 O
of O
the O
conversation O
and O
I O
tended B-DIS
to I-DIS
withdraw I-DIS
. O
Over O
time O
I O
can O
see O
isolation O
occurring O
if O
I O
can O
t O
communicate O
. O
My O
HA O
filters O
background O
noise O
pretty O
well O
and O
I O
can O
now O
get O
90 O
of O
the O
conversation O
. O
So O
like O
most O
MD O
situations O
, O
you O
see O
what O
life O
gives O
you O
and O
figure O
out O
how O
to O
manage O
. O
Your O
spouse O
is O
lucky O
to O
have O
your O
support O
 
Your O
onset O
is O
similar O
to O
mine O
, O
with O
depression B-DIS
before O
. O
When O
my O
mental O
health O
improved O
, O
I O
was O
left O
with O
the O
CFS B-DIS
symptoms O
. O
It O
gets O
even O
more O
confusing O
because O
a O
few O
months O
before O
the O
depression B-DIS
bout O
I O
went O
through O
several O
infections B-DIS
and O
a O
lot O
of O
stress B-DIS
at O
work O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
if O
those O
things O
are O
related O
or O
not O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
the O
certainty O
of O
a O
sudden O
onset O
. O
I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
had O
any O
symptoms O
before O
that O
, O
but O
I O
can O
t O
be O
sure O
. O
I O
always O
felt O
I O
needed O
more O
rest O
and O
quiet O
than O
others O
, O
but O
it O
never O
limited O
me O
in O
any O
way O
before O
CFS B-DIS
hit O
, O
I O
think O
. O
 
I O
have O
tried O
reglan B-DRUG
, O
erythromycin B-DRUG
, O
and O
azithromycin B-DRUG
prescribed O
by O
my O
GI O
motility O
specialist O
. O
Had O
bad O
side O
effects O
with O
all O
of O
them O
. O
Got O
a O
Botox B-DRUG
injection O
in O
my O
pylorus O
on O
the O
11th O
to O
help O
with O
gastric O
motility O
, O
but O
it O
doesn O
t O
seem O
to O
have O
helped O
that O
much O
. O
 
That O
s O
not O
a O
dumb O
question O
, O
it O
s O
super O
weird O
and O
counter O
intuitive O
. O
Most O
people O
feel O
the O
urge O
to O
urinate O
when O
the O
bladder O
is O
approaching O
full O
, O
and O
feel O
the O
urge O
to O
end O
the O
stream O
when O
the O
bladder O
is O
approaching O
emptiness O
. O
In O
reality O
, O
they O
could O
probably O
urinate O
quite O
a O
lot O
both O
before O
and O
after O
each O
normal O
trip O
to O
the O
bathroom O
, O
they O
just O
don O
t O
because O
the O
urge O
isn O
t O
there O
. O
The O
nurse O
who O
does O
urinalysis O
at O
my O
doctor O
s O
office O
likes O
to O
remind O
everyone O
that O
the O
human O
body O
can O
generate O
sufficient O
urine O
for O
urinalysis O
every O
10 O
minutes O
. O
For O
IC O
patients O
, O
it O
s O
common O
to O
be O
hypersensitive O
to O
the O
presence O
of O
urine O
in O
the O
bladder O
, O
since O
it O
s O
irritating O
. O
As O
a O
consequence O
, O
we O
pee O
more O
often O
, O
and O
empty O
the O
bladder O
more O
completely O
each O
time O
we O
urinate O
as O
long O
as O
we O
don O
t O
have O
emptying O
issues O
and O
or O
urethral O
pain O
that O
can O
lead O
to O
retention O
. O
We O
re O
not O
generating O
more O
urine O
, O
we O
re O
just O
expelling O
it O
more O
frequently O
, O
so O
we O
re O
more O
aware O
of O
the O
actual O
quantity O
our O
body O
is O
producing O
than O
someone O
who O
only O
pees O
a O
few O
times O
a O
day O
would O
realize O
. O
One O
of O
the O
most O
popular O
pieces O
of O
advice O
for O
IC O
patients O
is O
to O
increase O
, O
not O
decrease O
, O
fluid O
intake- O
it O
usually O
doesn O
t O
make O
urgency O
frequency O
worse O
and O
can O
make O
them O
better O
. O
 
Lol O
nice O
 
I O
made O
up O
sand O
bags O
to O
rest O
my O
forearms O
, O
side O
of O
my O
hands O
on O
. O
Just O
having O
a O
support O
helps O
some O
. O
When O
medicine O
is O
on O
, O
and O
everythng O
was O
good O
, O
I O
was O
able O
to O
solder O
. O
Admitted O
easier O
with O
through O
hole O
leads O
as O
I O
could O
rest O
the O
tip O
of O
my O
weller O
iron O
against O
the O
pad O
and O
compoent O
lead O
. O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
SMD O
stuff O
, O
I O
tend O
to O
scoot O
it O
around O
a O
little O
too O
much O
. O
Hence O
solder O
paste O
to O
hold O
the O
part O
then O
used O
a O
cast O
iron O
skillet O
method O
. O
Turn O
on O
hot O
plate O
, O
once O
you O
see O
the O
solder O
shiny O
and O
flow O
, O
turn O
hot O
plate O
off O
to O
let O
it O
cool O
. O
Price O
was O
right O
old O
hot O
plate O
and O
skillet O
. O
Still O
want O
to O
build O
a O
simple O
reflow O
oven O
. O
I O
m O
still O
working O
on O
my O
DBS O
settings O
. O
While O
I O
have O
reduced O
the O
amplitude O
of O
my O
tremors B-DIS
, O
I O
still O
have O
some O
tremor B-DIS
. O
Still O
a O
work O
in O
progress O
. O
 
You O
re O
not O
a O
downer O
, O
that O
s O
the O
reality O
of O
the O
situation O
. O
I O
hate O
how O
hard O
it O
is O
to O
get O
healthcare O
in O
this O
country O
. O
Lots O
of O
colleges O
should O
have O
free O
therapy O
of O
some O
sort O
for O
students O
that O
doesn O
t O
require O
going O
through O
insurance O
. O
Does O
your O
school O
have O
anything O
like O
that O
 
WHY O
WOULD O
YOU O
EAT O
RAW O
MEAT O
I O
mean O
I O
m O
glad O
this O
has O
helped O
you O
so O
far O
. O
Were O
you O
formally O
diagnosed O
with O
Cfs B-DIS
I O
d O
be O
interested O
to O
know O
how O
you O
get O
on O
energy O
wise O
. O
 
Four O
days O
ago O
a O
left B-DIS
ear I-DIS
infection I-DIS
began O
after O
one O
previous O
week O
of O
worsening B-DIS
cold I-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
. O
I O
now O
have O
constant B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
and I-DIS
ringing I-DIS
in I-DIS
ear I-DIS
, O
one O
two-hour O
bout O
of O
serious B-DIS
vertigo I-DIS
, O
near-constant B-DIS
dizziness I-DIS
, O
difficulty B-DIS
concentrating I-DIS
, O
regular B-DIS
specks I-DIS
of I-DIS
black I-DIS
in I-DIS
vision I-DIS
similar O
to O
when O
you O
stare O
at O
a O
black O
box O
and O
you O
shift O
your O
eyes O
to O
white O
space O
, O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
ear I-DIS
which O
has O
subsided O
with O
Tylenol B-DRUG
, O
light B-DIS
headache I-DIS
, O
some O
achyness B-DIS
behind I-DIS
and I-DIS
below I-DIS
ear I-DIS
to I-DIS
neck I-DIS
, O
and O
self-determined O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
to I-DIS
low I-DIS
sounds I-DIS
. O
Upon O
a O
visit O
my O
primary O
says O
it O
looks O
and O
sounds O
a O
lot O
like O
Meniere O
s O
Syndrome O
distinguishable O
from O
MD B-DIS
, O
according O
to O
him O
and O
info O
I O
ve O
seen O
. O
I O
m O
on O
day O
four O
of O
seven O
of O
antibiotics B-DRUG
. O
I O
plan O
on O
contacting O
Dr. O
Glacek O
during O
working O
hours O
tomorrow O
, O
but O
shouldn O
t O
I O
just O
ask O
demand O
that O
my O
primary O
give O
me O
these O
anti-virals B-DRUG
If O
possible O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
should O
try O
and O
nip O
this O
in O
the O
bud O
before O
it O
becomes O
chronic O
, O
right O
Thoughts O
and O
prayers O
to O
those O
living O
lives O
affected O
by O
Meniere O
s O
. O
 
Not O
all O
tanning O
beds O
are O
UVA O
and O
UVB O
. O
UVA O
is O
the O
bigger O
cause O
of O
skin B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
. O
The O
chamber O
I O
use O
is O
UVB O
only O
and O
monitored O
by O
my O
dermatologist O
, O
so O
he O
s O
the O
one O
who O
sets O
the O
amount O
of O
time O
I O
m O
in O
there O
. O
 
Primary B-DIS
progressive I-DIS
MS I-DIS
usually O
affects O
older O
people O
, O
because O
they O
have O
less O
neural O
reserve O
. O
Younger O
people O
s O
bodies O
can O
repair O
damage O
more O
efficiently O
, O
and O
thus O
they O
remit O
after O
a O
relapse O
. O
It O
is O
extremely O
rare O
, O
yet O
not O
unknown O
, O
for O
young O
people O
to O
get O
PPMS B-DIS
. O
 
Thanks O
 
Like O
a O
lot O
of O
others O
here O
I O
m O
on O
the O
three O
month O
packs O
. O
I O
ve O
found O
that O
benadryl B-DRUG
really O
helps O
the O
hormonal B-DIS
flares I-DIS
burning B-DIS
. O
Maybe O
it O
ll O
help O
the O
other O
symptoms O
 
If O
you O
re O
referring O
to O
nausea B-DIS
, O
my O
best O
tip O
is O
gravol B-DRUG
before O
you O
re O
ready O
to O
take O
it O
and O
always O
take O
it O
before O
bed O
. O
I O
try O
to O
ride O
out O
some O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
. O
Or O
if O
you O
find O
the O
side O
effects O
are O
4-5 O
hours O
later O
, O
then O
delay O
your O
sleep O
. O
 
No O
but O
I O
feel O
for O
you O
that O
happened O
when O
I O
was O
about O
11 O
. O
It O
s O
a O
terrible O
feeling O
and O
doctors O
would O
do O
that O
should O
be O
ashamed O
of O
themselves O
. O
This O
particular O
office O
was O
just O
frustrated O
on O
how O
strong O
my O
IBS B-DIS
is O
, O
told O
me O
it O
s O
my O
anxiety B-DIS
despite O
my O
anxiety B-DIS
being O
well O
managed O
by O
medicine O
, O
that O
they O
were O
out O
of O
medical O
options O
for O
me O
and O
started O
to O
ignore O
mu O
calls O
. O
When O
I O
told O
them O
I O
wanted O
to O
switch O
they O
agreed O
it O
was O
the O
right O
choice O
. O
As O
I O
said O
though O
despite O
a O
random O
IBS B-DIS
attack I-DIS
tonight O
, O
I O
m O
very O
happy O
with O
the O
new O
dr O
. O
I O
hope O
that O
you O
can O
find O
a O
good O
dr O
to O
replace O
your O
current O
one O
with O
. O
Perhaps O
see O
if O
there O
are O
any O
that O
specialize O
in O
IBS B-DIS
in O
your O
area O
. O
 
The O
stone B-DIS
moved O
when O
the O
pain B-DIS
was O
bad O
on O
me O
well O
after O
jogging O
, O
both O
times O
. O
First O
one O
happened O
shortly O
after O
going O
to O
bed O
, O
and O
the O
second O
happened O
the O
next O
morning O
. O
First O
indication O
was O
brownish B-DIS
colored I-DIS
pee I-DIS
, O
from O
blood O
being O
in O
it O
. O
I O
never O
saw O
the O
first O
stone O
, O
but O
the O
second O
one O
I O
peed O
out O
about O
4 O
days O
later O
. O
 
not O
heard O
of O
that O
one O
. O
Googled O
it O
, O
I O
think O
I O
d O
much O
rather O
have O
narcotics B-DRUG
. O
 
Agreed O
, O
the O
pain B-DIS
is O
excruciating O
When O
i O
had O
my O
first O
, O
it O
hit O
me O
right O
after O
I O
woke O
up O
. O
The O
pain B-DIS
initially O
felt O
a O
lot O
like O
the O
discomfort B-DIS
I O
feel O
after O
eating O
a O
lot O
of O
hot O
sauce O
think O
ghost O
pepper O
, O
but O
quickly O
ramped O
up O
to O
my O
appendix O
is O
going O
to O
explode O
. O
I O
eventually O
called O
911 O
on O
myself O
cause O
I O
was O
in O
too O
much O
pain B-DIS
to O
drive O
myself O
to O
the O
ER O
. O
No O
fun O
. O
 
My O
doc O
thinks O
I O
probably O
have O
***BOTH*** O
. O
Which O
is O
like O
fuck O
but O
, O
at O
least O
I O
have O
deafness B-DIS
to O
look O
forward O
to O
now O
. O
And O
vertigo B-DIS
burnout I-DIS
. O
Yes O
, O
I O
seem O
to O
have O
progressive B-DIS
hearing I-DIS
loss I-DIS
. O
But O
its O
going O
by O
slowly O
. O
my O
ENT O
thinks O
that O
I O
will O
have O
a O
handful O
of O
Meniere O
s O
attacks O
a O
year O
But O
will O
just O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
VM B-DIS
on O
the O
daily O
. O
And O
I O
got O
ear B-DRUG
steroid I-DRUG
shots I-DRUG
because O
I O
was O
experiencing O
episodes B-DIS
of I-DIS
deafness I-DIS
. O
Those O
have O
worn O
off O
. O
Now O
. O
which O
took O
away O
the O
vertigo B-DIS
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
. O
OMG O
that O
was O
awesome O
. O
the O
first O
time O
I O
felt O
stillness B-DIS
in O
a O
year O
was O
surreal O
. O
Was O
like O
woah O
, O
I O
am O
not O
feeling O
like O
I O
am O
moving O
. O
I O
dont O
know O
how O
to O
explain O
it O
. O
Thanks O
to O
the O
VM B-DIS
my O
hearing B-DIS
is I-DIS
unstable I-DIS
, O
So O
no O
hearing O
aids O
yet O
. O
Sigh O
. O
 
I O
take O
Modafinil B-DRUG
as O
needed O
probably O
a O
few O
times O
a O
month O
when O
the O
fatigue B-DIS
is O
just O
unbearable O
. O
My O
doctor O
has O
told O
me O
that O
in O
her O
experience O
, O
patients O
do O
well O
when O
they O
do O
2 O
days O
on O
the O
pill O
, O
then O
1 O
day O
off O
. O
I O
ve O
noticed O
that O
works O
well O
for O
me O
and O
I O
tend O
to O
feel O
the O
most O
energy O
the O
2nd O
and O
3rd O
days O
. O
Maybe O
try O
that O
and O
see O
if O
that O
works O
- O
hopefully O
you O
get O
some O
fatigue B-DIS
relief O
soon O
. O
 
Her O
words O
exactly O
was O
supposed O
to O
put O
auto-immune B-DIS
disease I-DIS
into O
remission O
. O
Many O
of O
doctors O
she O
s O
consulted O
have O
suggested O
Naltrexone B-DRUG
. O
I O
think O
for O
opioid B-DIS
addiction I-DIS
its O
more O
of O
high O
dosage O
. O
I O
agree O
that O
right O
now O
anything O
is O
worth O
it O
. O
She O
isnt O
really O
enjoying O
the O
states O
shes O
in O
and O
I O
m O
pretty O
sure O
it O
s O
from O
neglecting O
the O
drugs O
. O
I O
think O
MTX B-DRUG
would O
have O
been O
worth O
it O
from O
the O
beginning O
because O
i O
m O
sure O
the O
side O
effects O
could O
have O
been O
treated O
better O
than O
the O
condition O
shes O
in O
now O
. O
 
I O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
the O
same O
age O
. O
It O
definitely O
takes O
time O
to O
find O
what O
medications O
work O
. O
The O
first O
line O
is O
always O
methotrexate B-DRUG
chemo O
however O
in O
my O
experience O
, O
for O
many O
people O
it O
s O
not O
enough O
to O
completely O
control O
the O
disease O
. O
There O
are O
many O
new O
therapies O
available O
, O
so O
after O
giving O
the O
new O
medication O
some O
time O
to O
work O
, O
don O
t O
give O
up O
hope O
When O
my O
RA B-DIS
was O
more O
active O
, O
gentle O
stretching O
and O
range O
of O
motions O
exercises O
were O
great O
for O
me O
. O
I O
also O
took O
an O
aqua O
aerobics O
class O
that O
the O
best O
, O
most O
comfortable O
work O
out O
for O
me O
then O
. O
I O
have O
been O
lucky O
enough O
to O
find O
a O
great O
medication O
that O
works O
and O
no O
longer O
have O
to O
take O
painkillers B-DRUG
, O
or O
antiinflammatories B-DRUG
. O
Many O
people O
ar O
eventually O
able O
to O
find O
something O
that O
works O
. O
Good O
luck O
to O
you O
and O
her O
Let O
me O
know O
if O
you O
have O
any O
questions O
. O
 
Coffee O
makes O
you O
pee O
. O
It O
has O
a O
bit O
of O
oxalate B-DRUG
in O
it O
, O
but O
also O
makes O
you O
pee O
more O
so O
it O
ends O
up O
slightly O
net O
positive O
. O
 
I O
drink O
sparkling O
water O
quite O
a O
bit O
. O
I O
buy O
the O
Walmart O
brand O
. O
I O
can O
t O
drink O
regular O
soda O
generally O
without O
seriously O
regretting O
it O
, O
but O
the O
sparkling O
water O
doesn O
t O
make O
me O
feel O
sick O
. O
 
Apologies O
, O
I O
don O
t O
check O
this O
account O
very O
often O
I O
ve O
seen O
multiple O
doctors O
who O
believe O
it O
is O
a O
stone B-DIS
, O
but O
I O
m O
still O
waiting O
for O
my O
scan O
on O
July O
7th O
. O
Seeing O
a O
urologist O
on O
July O
24th O
. O
The O

differently O
. O
I O
personally O
think O
it O
s O
best O
to O
start O
with O
just O
T4 B-DRUG
, O
since O
not O
everyone O
needs O
added O
T3 B-DRUG
. O
There O
s O
synthetic B-DRUG
T3 I-DRUG
as O
well O
as O

Carrying O

Wonderful O
news O

I O

develops O
and O
becomes O
a O
run O

mill O

for O
pwp.. B-DIS
 
Oh O
Even O
better O
 
That O
s O
how O
I O
got O
diagnosed O
as O
well O
, O
I O
just O
woke O
up O
one O
morning O
and O
the O
whole O
left O
side O
of O
my O
body O
didn O
t O
work O
. O
Face O
, O
arm O
, O
trunk O
, O
leg O
and O
foot O
... O
it O
was O
so O
scary O
. O
I O
spent O
2 O
months O
in O
a O
rehabilitation O
center O
to O
learn O
how O
to O
walk O
again O
. O
This O
was O
last O
January O
, O
brain O
scan O
showed O
6 O
lesions O
one O
being O
4cm O
in O
circumference O
, O
now O
I O
know O
that O
s O
HUGE O
. O
I O
was O
26 O
with O
a O
10 O
month O
old O
son O
... O
thank O
god O
I O
have O
the O
best O
family O
ever O
. O
My O
life O
and O
body O
hasn O
t O
been O
the O
same O
since O
. O
I O
will O
always O
walk B-DIS
with I-DIS
a I-DIS
weird I-DIS
gate I-DIS
now O
and O
I O
can O
t O
eat O
difficult O
things O
because O
my O
jaw B-DIS
stops I-DIS
working I-DIS
. O
I O
have O
lost O
at O
least O
20 O
of O
my O
coordination O
and O
strength O
on O
my O
left O
side O
probably O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
 
I O
remember O
reading O
somewhere O
that O
it O
can O
irritate O
them O
further O
, O
but O
I O
found O
conflicting O
opinions O
on O
that O
so O
just O
start O
slow O
if O
you O
decide O
to O
try O
it O
. O
Also O
I O
just O
started O
taking O
tumeric O
capsules O
, O
which O
I O
think O
might O
be O
helping O
but O
it O
s O
hard O
to O
tell O
so O
far O
. O
 
Mine O
happened O
suddenly O
, O
when O
I O
was O
26 O
. O
I O
was O
reading O
the O
newspaper O
when O
everything B-DIS
just I-DIS
started I-DIS
spinning I-DIS
and O
I O
started O
vomiting B-DIS
. O
that O
one O
lasted O
for O
days O
and O
I O
felt B-DIS
like I-DIS
dying I-DIS
as O
I O
just O
wanted O
it O
to O
end O
. O
that O
was O
16 O
years O
ago O
and O
I O
ve O
had O
regular O
attacks O
ever O
since O
. O
it O
was O
only O
3 O
years O
ago O
that O
my O
hearing B-DIS
became I-DIS
effected I-DIS
. O
I O
was O
sent O
for O
a O
MRI O
to O
rule O
out O
a O
tumour B-DIS
. O
before O
that O
incident O
though O
, O
the O
attacks O
would O
usually O
follow O
a O
pattern O
so O
I O
d O
know O
what O
to O
expect O
, O
but O
now O
there O
so O
random O
in O
length O
of O
time O
they O
last O
to O
severity O
and O
also O
trigger O
. O
even O
though O
my O
1st O
attack O
was O
sudden O
, O
I O
m O
convinced O
its O
connected O
to O
when O
I O
was O
a O
child O
. O
I O
was O
a O
nightmare O
whenever O
we O
traveled O
. O
I O
d O
always O
have O
travel B-DIS
sickness I-DIS
, O
and O
smells O
would O
become O
intense O
making O
it O
worse O
. O
like O
the O
smell O
of O
petrol O
if O
we O
had O
just O
filled O
up O
before O
setting O
off O
, O
or O
when O
it O
was O
a O
warm O
day O
and O
you O
got O
into O
the O
car O
, O
for O
me O
they O
would O
be O
a O
certain O
smell O
that O
would O
trigger O
my O
sickness B-DIS
. O
and O
even O
now O
they O
are O
triggers O
. O
its O
hard O
to O
explain O
what O
I O
mean O
. O
 
gt O
; O
You O
never O
think O
you O
have O
a O
hearing B-DIS
problem I-DIS
. O
The O
thing O
with O
Meniere O
s O
is O
the O
pressure B-DIS
is O
so O
intense O
that O
it O
weights O
down O
on O
your O
hearing O
filaments O
making O
it O
difficult B-DIS
to I-DIS
hear I-DIS
. O
Could O
you O
explain O
this O
bullet O
in O
more O
detail O
It O
seems O
like O
you O
re O
saying O
that O
people O
with O
Meniere O
s O
are O
not O
usually O
aware O
of O
the O
hearing B-DIS
problem I-DIS
. O
Is O
that O
what O
you O
meant O
Thanks O
. O
 
I O
have O
no O
advice O
for O
you O
but O
my O
dad O
is O
going O
through O
literally O
the O
exact O
same O
thing O
you O
describe O
and O
is O
trying O
out O
the O
same O
meds O
. O
He O
has O
crippling O
anxiety B-DIS
. O
He O
s O
been O
on O
the O
meds O
for O
2 O
weeks O
now O
and O
he O
had O
mood B-DIS
swings I-DIS
and O
was O
moving O
slower O
than O
usual O
so O
they O
adjusted O
his O
meds O
again O
. O

you O

this O
time O

I O
wasn O
t O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
it O
was O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
and O
diclofenac B-DRUG
for O
me O
but O
I O
didn O
t O
want O
to O
take O
any O
medication O
during O
pregnancy O
so O
quite O
everything O
about O
3 O
months O
prior O
to O
trying O
. O
I O
flared B-DIS
instantly O
. O
Unfortunately O
we O
didn O
t O
conceive O
quickly O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
go O
back O
on O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
as O
I O
couldn O
t O
cope O
without O
it O
indefinitely O
. O
Finally O
conceived O
after O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
and O
I O
quit O
my O
meds O
again O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
a O
positive O
test O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
go O
into O
remission O
straight O
away O
, O
not O
until O
about O
25 O
weeks O
, O
then O
I O
suddenly O
felt O
better O
almost O
overnight O
. O
I O
sailed O
through O
my O
3rd O
trimester O
, O
as O
I O
d O
never O
felt O
so O
comfortable O
. O
I O
went O
back O
on O
sulfasalazine B-DRUG
after O
my O
son O
was O
born O
as O
it O
is O
fine O
for O
breastfeeding O
as O
far O
as O
we O
can O
tell O
. O
I O
flared B-DIS
up I-DIS
really I-DIS
bad I-DIS
about O
8 O
weeks O
out O
as O
predicted O
, O
before O
the O
meds O
kicked O
in O
again O
. O
Luckily O
we O
have O
family O
close O
to O
help O
out O
when O
I O
need O
it O
. O
 
Yes O
, O
my O
Urologist O
has O
IC B-DIS
. O
When O
he O
first O
told O
me O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
be O
great O
to O
have O
someone O
who O
understands O
. O
I O
ve O
since O
learned O
that O
all O
he O
does O
is O
use O
himself O
as O
a O
model O
of O
what O
IC B-DIS
looks O
like O
. O
If O
what O
I O
am O
experiencing O
is O
different O
then O
him O
, O
then O
it O
s O
not O
real O
or O
a O
problem O
. O
I O
ve O
stopped O
going O
to O
him O
. O
Haven O
t O
found O
another O
doctor O
yet O
, O
though O
. O
 
I O
have O
it O
, O
my O
father O
does O
too O
, O
as O
well O
as O
my O
uncle O
his O
brother O
. O
There O
is O
a O
link O
in O
my O
family O
. O
Sorry O
to O
be O
a O
Debbie O
Downer O
, O
just O
thought O
I O
d O
weigh O
in O
. O
It O
s O
terrible O
, O
but O
maybe O
I O
shouldn O
t O
have O
kids O
so O
that O
I O
do O
not O
pass O
this O
on O
. O
Edit O
grammar O
 
I O
do O
. O
I O
was O
fitted O
with O
a O
gastric O
pacemaker O
just O
under O
two O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
s O
been O
amazing O
. O
Obviously O
if O
I O
m O
under O
stress O
or O
really O
tired B-DIS
then O
I O
do O
have O
symptoms O
especially O
vomiting B-DIS
, O
but O
I O
realise O
the O
pacemaker O
isn O
t O
a O
cure O
, O
it O
s O
just O
to O
help O
lessen O
the O
the O
symptoms O
. O
I O
do O
need O
to O
be O
clever O
about O
how O
I O
eat O
and O
how O
much O
energy O
I O
use O
up O
and O
how O
long O
I O
have O
rest O
have O
lazy O
days O
. O
How O
are O
you O
feeling O
 
I O
had O
my O
first O
appointment O
this O
week O
It O
was O
awesome O
It O
s O
more O
for O
postpartum B-DIS
just O
had O
a O
baby O
a O
year O
ago O
. O
Glad O
I O
made O
the O
call O
and O
decided O
to O
go O
 
I O
think O
improvements O
should O
be O
the O
goal O
, O
not O
being O
cured O
. O
Positional O
therapy O
worked O
for O
my O
moderate B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
when O
I O
was O
younger O
, O
got O
worse O
as O
I O
got O
a O
bit O
older O
and O
now O
do O
positional O
mouth O
piece O
. O
Should O
probably O
get O
a O
cpap O
, O
but O
just O
not O
mentally O
there O
. O
I O
m O
healthy O
weight O
, O
so O
that O
s O
not O
part O
of O
it O
, O
but O
quitting O
smoking O
made O
a O
big O
difference O
and O
frankly O
exercise O
seems O
to O
help O
for O
whatever O
reason O
. O
Perhaps O
that O
s O
more O
around O
general O
sleep O
hygiene O
... O
hard O
to O
keep O
consistent O
. O
 
Hey O
with O
all O
that O
going O
on O
, O
I O
would O
be O
feeling O
down O
too O
When O
I O
don O
t O
want O
to O
leave O
my O
bed O
due O
to O
the O
pain O
or O
be O
social O
, O
I O
let O
the O
tears O
flow O
. O
It O
s O
a O
good O
release O
Also O
, O
I O
like O
to O
write O
about O
my O
frustrations O
in O
my O
journal O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
start O
feeling O
better O
. O

Sulfasalazine B-DRUG
 
Given O
that O
you O
re O
female O
the O
stent O
removal O
will O
be O
a O
piece O
of O
cake O
. O
There O
s O
nothing O
to O
be O
embarrassed O
about O
. O
There O
will O
be O
a O
nurse O
with O
you O
. O
If O
there O
is O
an O
external O
string O
it O
s O
very O
easy O
to O
grab O
the O
string O
and O
pull O
it O
out O
. O
Takes O
seconds O
. O
If O
it O
s O
internal O
it O
s O
still O
not O
a O
big O
deal O
. O
The O
doc O
puts O
a O
skinny O
scope O
up O
your O
urethra O
, O
which O
sounds O
horrible O
but O
it O
s O
just O
a O
little O
pressure B-DIS
and O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
burning B-DIS
. O
I O
took O
a O
Percocet B-DRUG
before O
I O
went O
to O
the O
office O
and O
did O
a O
lot O
of O
deep O
breathing O
. O
The O
whole O
thing O
should O
be O
over O
and O
done O
with O
in O
about O
30 O
seconds O
. O
I O
did O
not O
feel O
it O
come O
out O
. O
Don O
t O
take O
Azo B-DRUG
beforehand O
because O
it O
makes O
the O
stent O
slippery O
. O
I O
did O
that O
and O
the O
stent O
slipped O
out O
of O
the O
grasper O
so O
the O
doc O
had O
to O
go O
in O
a O
second O
time O
. O
But O
like O
I O
said O
it O
only O
takes O
seconds O
. O
My O
doctor O
was O
extremely O
professional O
about O
the O
whole O
thing O
and O
talked O
to O
me O
afterwards O
about O
what O
to O
expect O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
. O
He O
said O
any O
pain B-DIS
I O
was O
having O
should O
go O
away O
in O
about O
12 O
hours O
. O
And O
he O
was O
right O
, O
11 O
hours O
later O
I O
was O
fine O
. O
I O
did O
have O
some O
strong B-DIS
pain I-DIS
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
after O
the O
stent O
was O
removed O
so O
I O
laid O
down O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
and O
it O
went O
away O
. O
But O
I O
didn O
t O
need O
any O
more O
Percocets B-DRUG
after O
the O
stent O
was O
removed O
. O
 
Still O
have O
them O
. O
Maybe O
even O
a O
bit O
more O
so O
on O
my O
left O
from O
the O
DBS O
wire O
running O
from O
my O
skull O
to O
the O
stimulator O
unit O
in O
my O
chest O
. O
 
Let O
me O
just O
clarify O
something O
for O
you O
, O
perhaps O
she O
does O
not O
understand O
either O
. O
MS B-DIS
will O
not O
shorten O
her O
life O
. O
Eventually O
she O
may O
develop O
cardio O
kidney B-DIS
problems I-DIS
as O
a O
result O
of O
not O
exercising O
and O
a O
poor O
diet O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
people O
with O
MS O
can O
develop O
these O
issues O
because O
they O
are O
unable O
to O
exercise O
. O
Realistically O
your O
sister O
should O
be O
doing O
as O
much O
as O
she O
can O
now O
in O
the O
area O
of O
healthy O
living O
to O
delay O
avoid O
these O
problems O
in O
later O
life O
. O
Is O
it O
possible O
she O
is O
suffering O
from O
depression B-DIS
causing O
her O
lack O
of O
motivation O
My O
advice O
would O
be O
to O
try O
to O
ease O
her O
back O
into O
a O
routine O
without O
piling O
responsibility O
on O
her O
. O
Maybe O
you O
could O
get O
her O
interested O
in O
volunteering O
with O
a O
local O
food O
bank O
or O
friends O
of O
the O
elderly O
two O
days O
a O
week O
. O
It O
will O
introduce O
some O
structure O
back O
into O
her O
life O
and O
help O
her O
break O
the O
cycle O
she O
has O
found O
herself O
in O
PM O
me O
if O
I O
can O
do O
anything O
to O
help O
. O
 
Whenever O
my O
psoriasis B-DIS
starts O
creeping O
down O
my O
scalp O
I O
rub O
it O
with O
coconut O
oil O
morning O
and O
night O
and O
that O
clears O
it O
up O
, O
but O
it O
doesn O
t O
do O
much O
for O
the O
psoriasis B-DIS
in O
my O
actual O
hair O
. O
But O
I O
also O
have O
long O
hair O
so O
it O
s O
difficult O
to O
get O
oil O
in O
there O
. O
 
Haha O
classic O
. O
I O
guess O
I O
could O
go O
decafe O
but O
I O
hear O
the O
process O
it O
s O
made O
is O
very O
chemically O
so O
it O
could O
be O
worse O
for O
me O
. O
TBH O
I O
don O
t O
know O
what O
i O
was O
taking O
. O
Some O
natural O
medicine O
, O
creams O
, O
and O
diet O
. O
The O
link O
below O
is O
the O
place O
I O
went O
through O
. O
The O
diet O
was O
based O
on O
eating O
non O
acidic O
food O
, O
I O
think O
. O
Getting O
the O
body O
s O
ph O
level O
in O
balance O
but O
I O
never O
did O
any O
tests O
to O
see O
if O
it O
changed O
. O
 
Getting O
up O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
is O
a O
sign O
that O
you O
re O
not B-DIS
getting I-DIS
into I-DIS
deep I-DIS
sleep I-DIS
where O
hormones O
are O
released O
that O
slow O
down O
urine O
production O
. O
I O
got O
up O
3-4 O
times O
a O
night O
at O
my O
worst O
right O
before O
getting O
a O
machine O
. O
I O
m O
down O
to O
0-1 O
time O
a O
night O
now O
. O
Taking O
the O
mask O
on O
and O
off O
varies O
by O
mask O
. O
Some O
have O
quick O
releases O
for O
the O
hose O
so O
you O
don O
t O
take O
it O
off O
, O
just O
unclip O
and O
go O
. O
Others O
have O
really O
simple O
headgear O
that O
s O
a O
breeze O
to O
take O
on O
and O
off O
Resmed O
P10 O
, O
for O
example O
What O
does O
that O
740 O
cover O
Machine O
, O
mask O
and O
all O
the O
supplies O
to O
get O
you O
started O
EDIT O
You O
have O
complex B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
Central O
amp O
; O
Obstructive O
. O
ASV O
machines O
are O
VERY O
expensive O
, O
so O
740 O
is O
a O
steal O
if O
you O
need O
an O
ASV O
, O
not O
a O
CPAP O
or O
APAP O
You O
can O
buy O
machines O
cheaper O
online O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
go O
used O
. O
A O
used O
DS560 O
with O
humidifier O
is O
380 O
. O
Then O
you O
ll O
need O
to O
add O
a O
mask O
75-250 O
new O
, O
depending O
on O
what O
kind O
you O
get O
, O
a O
backup O
hose O
10 O
, O
some O
extra O
filters O
12 O
. O
You O
ll O
also O
need O
to O
get O
some O
replacement O
seals O
. O
Price O
on O
those O
depends O
on O
what O
kind O
of O
mask O
you O
end O
up O
with O
15- O
70 O
each O
 
Sleep O
for O
the O
study O
. O
They O
hook O
you O
up O
and O
it O
s O
a O
mess O
, O
but O
it O
s O
a O
wonderful O
mess O
. O
There O
is O
so O
much O
information O
. O
Then O
they O
can O
determine O
what O
will O
be O
needed O
to O
help O
you O
sleep O
. O
Sleep O
is O
the O
key O
. O
Work O
through O
your O
issues O
and O
figure O
out O
what O
is O
causing O
your O
sleep B-DIS
disturbances I-DIS
. O
Then O
it O
can O
be O
treated O
. O
Also O
, O
fun O

Prazosin B-DRUG
, O
which O
was O
originally O
blood O
pressure O
medication O
, O
is O
currently O
used O
to O
help O
with O
severe B-DIS
nightmares I-DIS
in O
children O
and O
people O
with O
PTSD B-DIS
. O
It O
s O
a O
solid O
addition O
to O
my O
cocktail O
, O
because O
it O
helps O
me O
stay O
asleep O
. O
 
It O
pretty O
much O
sums O
up O
time O
to O
talk O
to O
a O
lawyer O
is O
before O
you O
need O
one O
. O
The O
company O
I O
work O
for O
has O
been O
fantastic O
in O
working O
me O
, O
and O
adjusting O
what O
I O
do O
. O
Always O
in O
the O
back O
of O
my O
mind O
is O
if O
we O
are O
acquired O
by O
another O
company O
... O
then O
what O
Hence O
legal O
advice O
is O
a O
good O
thing O
to O
have O
before O
you O
need O
it O
. O
 
Same O
i O
have O
had O
that O
damn O
headache B-DIS
for O
15 O
years O
. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
migraines B-DIS
, O
which O
I O
also O
have- O
I O
know O
because O
I O
occasionally O
have O
auras- B-DIS
but O
the O
chronic O
everyday O
one O
is O
from O
RA B-DIS
I O
think O
. O
I O
have O
pain B-DIS
just O
about O
every O
day O
. O
I O
take O
a O
pain B-DRUG
killer I-DRUG
several O
times O
a O
week O
to O
have O
a O
pain O
vacation O
. O
I O
also O
have O
Hashimoto O
s O
thyroiditis O
, O
another O
autoimmune B-DIS
disease I-DIS
. O
I O
think O
autoimmune B-DIS
conditions I-DIS
occur O
in O
clusters O
, O
and O
that O
once O
you O
ve O
got O
one O
you O
re O
susceptible O
to O
others O
. O
It O
s O
so O
hard O
to O
know O
where O
this O
headache B-DIS
comes O
from- O
because O
every O
condition O
I O
have O
has O
headache B-DIS
as O
a O
symptom O
. O
 
Essential B-DIS
Tremors I-DIS
are O
worsened O
by O
anxiety B-DIS
, O
stress B-DIS
, O
adrenaline B-DIS
. O
I O
have O
both O
Essential B-DIS
Tremors I-DIS
and O
Parkinson O
s O
Disease O
, O
and O
had O
to O
explain O
my O
health O
situation O
every O
time O
I O
conducted O
a O
class O
or O
gave O
a O
speech O
. O
I O
was O
confident O
also O
, O
it O
was O
so O
annoying O
to O
appear O
otherwise O
. O
My O
right B-DIS
leg I-DIS
would I-DIS
go I-DIS
nuts I-DIS
driving O
im O
snowy O
weather O
. O
You O
may O
want O
to O
talk O
to O
a O
neuro O
. O
 
The O
magnesium B-DRUG
in O
epsom B-DRUG
salts I-DRUG
is O
a O
pain B-DRUG
reliever I-DRUG
so O
it O
actually O
is O
helping O
more O
than O
being O
relaxing O
 
Are O
you O
sure O
They O
gave O
me O
a O
Ultrasound O
to O
determine O
if O
I O
had O
stones B-DIS
and O
the O
size O
. O
 
If O
all O
you O
did O
was O
play O
with O
the O
mask O
and O
it O
doesn O
t O
leak O
, O
it O
probably O
won O
t O
be O
a O
problem O
, O
but O
I O
would O
not O
use O
the O
humidifier O
. O
That O
said O
, O
you O
re O
not O
going O
to O
drop O
dead O
over O
night O
from O
not O
using O
it O
. O
You O
lived O
just O
fine O
before O
you O
got O
on O
the O
machine O
So O
I O
wouldn O
t O
drive O
yourself O
crazy O
over O
that O
. O
At O
most O
you O
ll O
just O
be O
super O
tired B-DIS
 
My O
primary O
care O
doctor O
suggested O
it O
might O
be O
IC B-DIS
after O
two O
negative O
cultures O
and O
me O
having O
a O
hunch O
it O
was O
that O
, O
and O
wanted O
me O
to O
go O
see O
a O
urologist O
. O
Back O
then O
they O
couldn O
t O
do O
an O
in O
office O
test O
because O
they O
just O
used O
dip O
stick O
tests O
and O
I O
was O
taking O
ton O
of O
Azo B-DRUG
for O
the O
pain B-DIS
. O
It O
was O
awful O
UTI B-DIS
pain I-DIS
that I-DIS
never I-DIS
went I-DIS
away I-DIS
. O
You O
can O
suggest O
it O
or O
wait O
until O
they O
suggest O
that O
s O
what O
it O
is O
, O
but O
make O
sure O
you O
get O
a O
culture O
done O
of O
your O
urine O
if O
you O
haven O
t O
gotten O
one O
already O
. O
After O
that O
they O
ll O
probably O
want O
you O
to O
see O
a O
specialist O
urologist O
urogynecologist O
, O
but O
I O
do O
think O
some O
others O
have O
been O
diagnosed O
by O
just O
a O
gyn O
There O
s O
not O
much O
first O
line O
treatments O
for O
IC B-DIS
outside O
of O
diet O
, O
prescription B-DRUG
strength I-DRUG
Azo I-DRUG
, O
antihistamines B-DRUG
, O
and O
elmiron B-DRUG
. O
A O
lot O
of O
these O
things O
you O
can O
go O
ahead O
and O
get O
started O
on O
yourself O
other O
than O
elmiron B-DRUG
from O
OTC B-DRUG
medications I-DRUG
if O
you O
really O
suspect O
that O
you O
have O
it O
and O
see O
if O
your O
pain B-DIS
improves O
at O
all O
. O
Just O
let O
them O
know O
what O
you O
ve O
taken O
. O
Hopefully O
it O
ll O
be O
something O
simpler O
to O
deal O
with O
. O
Good O
luck O
. O
 
I O
have O
a O
ton O
of O
issues B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
hands I-DIS
wrists B-DIS
work O
on O
a O
keyboard O
all O
day O
and O
my O
ankles O
. O
My O
fingerless O
compression O
gloves O
are O
the O
best O
thing O
ever O
. O
On O
really O
really O
bad O
days O
I O
ll O
sometimes O
wear O
my O
wrist O
braces O
over O
them O
, O
but O
they O
don O
t O
help O
with O
the O
pain B-DIS
so O
much O
as O
stop O
me O
from O
doing O
motions O
that O
hurt O
and O
provide O
extra O
support O
for O
the O
typing O
. O
At O
a O
florists O
you O
probably O
have O
a O
sink O
, O
and O
I O
like O
running O
warm O
gt O
; O
hot O
water O
over O
my O
hands O
. O
I O
also O
use O
biofreeze B-DRUG
pretty O
liberally O
. O
I O
used O
to O
run O
5-10ks O
. O
For O
shoes O
go O
to O
a O
good O
runners O
store O
and O
ask O
them O
to O
help O
you O
. O
Plan O
to O
spend O
100 O
on O
them O
and O
talk O
to O
them O
about O
where O
you O
run O
, O
how O
far O
, O
etc O
. O
They O
should O
be O
able O
to O
help O
you O
find O
a O
pair O
that O
will O
match O
what O
you O
are O
doing O
with O
your O
feet O
. O
I O
actually O
typically O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
for O
my O
daily O
sneakers O
as O
well O
because O
having O
the O
really O
good O
fit O
and O
support O
of O
the O
shoe O
helps O
. O
I O
would O
also O
bring O
your O
insert O
and O
talk O
to O
them O
about O
it O
. O
The O
store O
I O
used O
to O
go O
to O
was O
Runner O
s O
Roost O
, O
but O
I O
don O
t O
know O
if O
they O
are O
local O
to O
the O
Colorado O
area O
or O
national O
. O
Shoe O
quality O
is O
pretty O
much O
everything O
, O
which O
is O
why O
I O
m O
saying O
that O
you O
should O
plan O
to O
spend O
at O
least O
100 O
on O
them O
. O
Depending O
on O
where O
you O
live O
and O
the O
brand O
that O
works O
right O
for O
you O
it O
may O
not O
cost O
that O
much O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
never O
once O
regretted O
buying O
an O
expensive O
pair O
of O
running O
shoes O
that O
I O
had O
professional O
help O
picking O
out O
. O
And O
typically O
if O
you O
take O
 
care O
of O
them O
they O
will O
last O
several O
years O
. O
 
It O
is O
possible O
that O
it O
could O
be O
MS. B-DIS
You O
meet O
the O
diagnosis O
criteria O
which O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
thing O
to O
do O
. O
Plus O
only O
a O
small O
percentage O
of O
lesions B-DIS
cause O
symptoms O
10 O
, O

Something O
like O
that O

it O
s O
Friday O
and O
I O
m O
tired O
. O
If O
you O
feel O
uncomfortable O
with O
the O
diagnosis O
, O
I O
suggest O
you O
get O
a O
second O
opinion O
from O
an O
MS B-DIS
Specialist O
. O
They O
know O
what O
to O
look O
for O
on O
MRIs O
and O
many O
times O
catch O
things O
a O
radiologist O
or O
other O
Neuro O
could O
miss O
because O
they O
don O
t O
look O
at O
MRIs O
from O
MS B-DIS
patients O
all O
day O
. O
If O
it O
is O
MS B-DIS
, O
they O
have O
caught O
it O
very O
early O
in O
the O
disease O
. O
Have O
the O
doctors O
even O
started O
to O
talk O
to O
you O
about O
disease O
modifying O
therapies O
If O
an O
MS O
specialist O
has O
, O
then O
I O
would O
take O
it O
seriously O
. O
You O
re O
right O
, O
it O
s O
not O
beyond O
the O
realm O
of O
possibility O
that O
you O
don O
t. O
There O
are O
other O
things O
that O
cause O
lesions B-DIS
and O
other O
things O
that O
cause O
bands B-DIS
. O
If O
I O
were O
you O
, O
I O
d O
focus O
on O
living O
a O
healthy O
lifestyle O
. O
Exercise O
every O
day O
and O
maintain O
a O
healthy O
weight O
. O
I O
know O
it O
s O
hard O
, O
but O
try O
not O
to O
let O
this O
stress B-DIS
you O
out O
. O
I O
m O
sorry O
you O
re O
feeling O
like O
you O
re O
in O
limbo O
. O
 
Just O
from O
my O
own O
preferences O
here O
, O
but O
don O
t O
assume O
that O
her O
problems O
trump O
yours O
at O
all O
times O
. O
My O
wife O
, O
family O
, O
friends O
and O
co-workers O
sometimes O
downplay O
their O
own O
issues O
around O
me O
because O
, O
Oh O
, O
it O
s O
nothing O
like O
what O
YOU O
go O
through O
... O
Never O
forget O
that O
your O
SO O
wants O
to O
help O
you O
through O
your O
problems O
too O
, O
not O
just O
to O
be O
seen O
as O
some O
poor O
suffering O
being O
. O
Remain O
open O
to O
looking O
to O
your O
partner O
for O
help O
when O
you O
need O
it O
too O
. O
Also O
, O
someone O
mentioned O
their O
annoyance O
over O
miracle O
cures O
- O
there O
aren O
t O
any O
Switching O
meds O
involves O
a O
lot O
of O
waiting O
, O
trial O
and O
error O
. O
It O
feels O
insulting O
when O
someone O
comes O
along O
and O
says O
, O
Just O
take O
this O
injection O
biologic O
anti-inflammatory O
inhibitor O
herb O
, O
you O
ll O
be O
back O
to O
normal O
. O
And O
people O
will O
cone O
to O
YOU O
with O
these O
cures O
too O
. O
Help O
your O
SO O
to O
filter O
out O
this O
well-meaning O
line O
of O
advice O
. O
Good O
luck O
to O
you O
both O
, O
and O
thank O
you O
for O
caring O
and O
understanding O
your O
SO O
; O
it O
means O
a O
lot O
 
I O
skipped O
through O
the O
video O
and O
they O
don O
t O
even O
say O
what O
the O
treatment O
is O
Am O
I O
miss O
something O
Looks O
like O
it O
is O
just O
a O
before O
and O
after O
an O
implant O
. O
 
They O
did O
not O
give O
me O
any O
ideas O
for O
relief O
. O
I O
think O
it O
is O
because O
I O
didnt O
ask O
. O
I O
still O
get O
overwhelmed O
at O
the O
doctor O
because O
I O
am O
new O
to O
this O
. O
I O
will O
ask O
about O
what O
can O
help O
relieve O
symptoms O
in O
terms O
of O
stretches O
, O
etc O
. O
Thank O
you O

and O
Baclofen B-DRUG
for O
ticks B-DIS
and O

if O
it O
gets O
bad O
but O
really O
I O
just O
do O
what O
I O
can O
when O
I O
can O
and O
take O
it O
easy O
otherwise O
. O
 
I O
only O
had O
three O

I O
had O
to O
get O
up O

which O
was O
really O
a O
really O
nice O
change O

that O

another O

I O

worried O
about O
. O
I O
wake B-DIS
up I-DIS
constantly I-DIS
throughout I-DIS
the I-DIS
night I-DIS
and O
I O
only O
really O
feel O
like O
I O
m O
fully O
asleep O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O
The O
rest O
of O
the O
night O
I O
m O
dozing O
and O
keep O
waking O
up O
for O
just O
a O
few O
seconds O
. O
I O
don O
t O
think O
having O
the O
test O
on O
changed O
how O
I O
slept O
and O
it O
was O
a O
typical O
night O
. O
I O
wonder O
if O
the O
test O
will O
show O
negative O
BC O
I O
wake O
up O
soon O
enough O
before O
my O
sats O
drop O
. O
 
UPDATE O
went O
to O
urologist O
asking O
for O
help O
with O
nausea B-DIS
. O
He O
had O
me O
come O
in O
to O
his O
office O
to O
talk O
about O
the O
pain B-DIS
. O
He O
went O
ahead O
and O
sent O
me O
to O
the O
ER O
. O
Got O
after O
my O
family O
when O
I O
was O
on O
my O
way O
to O
the O
OR O
said O
I O
was O
drinking O
too O
much O
and O
said O
that O
s O
what O
made O
it O
worse O
and O
that O
he O
told O
me O
not O
to O
which O
was O
a O
lie O
. O
They O
went O
ahead O
and O
put O
in O
a O
stent O
; O
I O
ve O
got O
to O
go O
back O
in O
a O
week O
to O
have O
it O
amp O
; O
the O
stones B-DIS
removed O
. O
Right O

It O

when I-DIS
I I-DIS
pee I-DIS
but O
so O
far O
no O
kidney B-DIS
pain I-DIS
which O
is O
glorious O
. O
How O
many O
people O
here O
have O
dealt O
with O
the O
ureteral O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
reply O
, O
but O
in O
terms O
of O
the O
insurance O
issues O
I O
am O
from O
Canada O
, O
so O
I O
am O
already O
under O
provincial O
insurance O
. O
The O
disability O
situation O
here O
is O
something O
else O
entirely O
and O
not O
easy O
at O
all O
to O
attain O
. O
It O
s O
the O
same O
with O
any O
treatment O
options O
- O
very O
different O
here O
. O
I O
have O
not O
yet O
received O
the O
diagnosis O
, O
but O
if O
I O
do O
and O
I O
m O
really O
hoping O
I O
do O
not O
I O
will O
try O
to O
participate O
in O
this O
sub O
and O
ask O
more O
questions O
- O
that O
is O
, O
if O
I O
don O
t O
lose O
my O
mind O
. O
I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
d O
want O
to O
be O
using O
a O
wheelchair O
either O
at O
her O
age.. O
god O
god O
. O
I O
can O
understand O
her O
insecurity O
and O
insistence O
on O
independence O
, O
that O
s O
only O
normal O
. O
 
Thanks O
for O
the O
input O
, O
I O
had O
to O
google O
some O
terms O
but O
it O
s O
good O
info O
. O
I O
ve O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
testing O
to O
rule O
things O
out O
- O
CRT O
scans O
, O
MRI O
, O
all O
kinds O
of O
GI-related O
test O
originally O
we O
thought O
this O
was O
a O
GI B-DIS
issue I-DIS
. O
It O
wasn O
t O
until O
I O
started O
to O
become O
really O
symptomatic O
that O
I O
started O
seeing O
a O
cardiologist O
and O
we O
started O
talking O
about O
POTS B-DIS
dysautonomia B-DIS
. O
I O
m O
taking O
metoprolol B-DRUG
, O
which O
I O
believe O
is O
a O
non-selective O
bb O
. O
That O
, O
plus O
a O
ton O
of O
salt O
, O
has O
helped O
keep O
most O
of O
my O
symptoms O
in O
check O
, O
although O
I O
still O
find O
myself O
waking O
up O
gasping B-DIS
for I-DIS
breath I-DIS
throughout O
the O
night O
. O
What O
kind O
of O
testing O
should O
I O
be O
asking O
my O
Dr. O
about O
 
My O
wrists O
don O
t O
bend O
at O
all O
. O
I O
m O
just O
extremely O
careful O
at O
what O
I O
do O
. O
Since O
I O
ve O
been O
like O
this O
for O
32 O
years O
, O
it O
s O
gotten O
a O
heck O
of O
a O
lot O
easier O
. O
But O
yeah O
when O
I O
was O
6 O
, O
I O
couldn O
t O
continue O
gymnastics O
, O
because O
every O
time O
I O
d O
do O
floor O
work O
, O
I O
d O
land O
on O
my O
head O
because O
my O
fingertips O
were O
the O
only O
thing O
holding O
me O
up O
when O
I O
tried O
to O
do O
flips O
cartwheels O
etc O
. O
The O
biggest O
pieces O
of O
advice O
I O
could O
give O
would O
be O
to O
let O
people O
know O
they O
don O
t O
bend O
. O
Every O
massage O
, O
every O
personal O
trainer O
, O
etc O
. O
it O
helps O
them O
not O
hurt O
you O
. O
And O
it O
does O
suck O
. O
I O
might O
suggest O
grabbing O
a O
brace O
for O
each O
wrist O
until O
you O
re O
fully O
comfortable O
and O
aware O
of O
being O
careful O
with O
them O
. O
You O
ll O
definitely O
get O
used O
to O
it O
. O
People O
ask O
me O
if O
it O
hurts O
, O
and O
it O
doesn O
t O
unless O
someone O
tries O
to O
bend O
it O
, O
so O
you O
ll O
get O
used O
to O
figuring O
out O
what O
your O
limits O
are O
and O
, O
for O
me O
, O
whatever O
pain B-DIS
there O
was O
, O
just O
became O
the O
norm O
. O
I O
don O
t O
even O
notice O
it O
anymore O
, O
if O
it O
flares O
up O
. O
 
hiya O
, O
thanks O
for O
your O
response O
. O
i O
do O
eat O
around O
1500 O
calories O
a O
day O
and O
remain O
active O
, O
and O
keep O
my O
plate O
colorful O
. O
i O
didn O
t O
let O
myself O
get O
overweight B-DIS
though O
, O
i O
think O
that O
s O
a O
little O
presumptuous O
. O
i O
was O
a O
plant-based O
vegan O
when O
i O
started O
gaining B-DIS
weight I-DIS
. O
one O
of O
the O
things O
about O
hypothyroidism B-DIS
is O
that O
weight B-DIS
gain I-DIS
and O
losing O
it O
after O
all O
of O
the O
weight B-DIS
gain I-DIS
can O
be O
extremely O
difficult O
despite O
attempts O
. O
anyway O
, O
i O
think O
i O
m O
going O
to O
give O
AIP B-DRUG
a O
shot O
and O
see O
if O
that O
helps O
. O
 
his O
doctors O
have O
warned O
the O
THC B-DRUG
could O
exacerbate O
the O
mental B-DIS
confusion I-DIS
, O
but O
he O
seems O
adamant O
about O
trying O
it O
we O
ve O
exhausted O
pretty O
much O
every O
other O
viable O
option O
at O
this O
point O
. O
until O
i O
find O
some O
CBD B-DRUG
oils I-DRUG
, O
we O
re O
really O
just O
crossing O
our O
fingers O
and O
hoping O
it O
helps O
with O
ANYTHING O
at O
all O
. O
brownie O
day O
is O
tomorrow O
 
Very O
true O
Things O
can O
change O
. O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
start O
keeping O
track O
. O
 
Hey O
, O
yeah O
that O
wasn O
t O
really O
what O
I O
meant O
. O
I O
meant O
more O
as O
The O
body O
and O
mind O
tries O
to O
sleep O
more O
in O
order O
to O
feel O
less O
tired B-DIS
. O
 
Yeah O
I O
have O
it O
. O
Autonomic B-DIS
neuropathy I-DIS
, O
most O
likely O
. O
I O
have O
severe O
issues O
with O
my O
veins B-DIS
not I-DIS
constricting I-DIS
. O
A O
bit O
with O
my O
arteries O
but O
not O
nearly O
as O
much O
as O
with O
my O
veins O
. O
It O
causes O
low B-DIS
heart I-DIS
filling I-DIS
pressures I-DIS
and O
significant B-DIS
dyspnea I-DIS
. O
My O
veins O
were O
pooling O
so O
much O
blood O
that O
I O
ended O
up O
with O
dvts B-DIS
and O
pulmonary B-DIS
embolisms I-DIS
. O
So O
my O
main O
issue O
is O
definitely O
dyspnea B-DIS
. O
I O
also O
have O
tachy B-DIS
Brady B-DIS
heart I-DIS
stuff I-DIS
, O
presyncope B-DIS
, O
Rashes B-DIS
, O
dysphagia B-DIS
, O
dizziness B-DIS
, O
lightheadedness B-DIS
, O
flushing B-DIS
and O
more O
yay O
lol O
. O
I O
know O
how O
rough O
it O
is O
. O
I O
was O
actually O
super O
healthy O
. O
Ran O
6 O
marathons O
, O
had O
graduated O
and O
was O
working O
as O
a O
PA O
ironically O
. O
Just O
married O
. O
You O
know O
all O
those O
normal O
things O
a O
26 O
year O
old O
does O
. O
Now O
2 O
years O
later O
I O
can O
t O
even O
walk O
through O
mother O
fucking O
target O
. O
What O
meds O
have O
you O
tried O
Do O
you O
have O
frequent O
dyspnea B-DIS
 
Audio O
books O
have O
been O
great O
You O

Metabolic B-DIS
Syndrome I-DIS
is O
common O
, O
and O
understood O
to O
be O
an O
important O
medical O
issue O
. O
It O
does O
not O
mimic O
CFS B-DIS
or O
disable O
people O
like O
CFS B-DIS
does O
, O
but O
it O
does O
contribute O
to O
a O
higher O
risk O
of O
various O
dangerous O
diseases O
and O
it O
shortens O
the O
lives O
of O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
people O
. O
Low B-DIS
iron I-DIS
and O
low B-DIS
thyroid I-DIS
can O
mimic O
CFS B-DIS
, O
but O
they O
are O
both O
easily O
discerned O
with O
simple O
blood O
tests O
. O
 
I O
just O
finished O
my O
loading O
doses O
of O
Remicade B-DRUG
the O
tail O
end O
of O
last O
month O
. O
I O
also O
have O
been O
taking O
Librax B-DRUG
for O
about O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
. O
My O
wife O
takes O
ativan B-DRUG
for O
anxiety B-DIS
, O
and O
she O
s O
been O
getting O
pissed O
off O
a O
lot O
more O
lately O
, O
too.. O
so O
take O
it O
for O
what O
it O
s O
worth O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
had O
a O
fairly O
short O
fuse O
lately O
. O
 
With O
my O
dad O
, O
it O
was O
falling B-DIS
. O
He O
fell O
frequently O
and O
we O
had O
no O
way O
of O
knowing O
unless O
someone O
stayed O
with O
him O
24 O
7 O
. O
He O
couldn O
t O
use O
a O
medic O
alert O
type O
product- O
he O
couldn O
t O
remember O
what O
it O
was O
and O
kept O
taking O
it O
off O
. O
Perhaps O
and O
accelerometer O
in O
a O
watch O
 
Hi O
, O
in O
short O
based O
on O
the O
information O
in O
your O
post O
this O
sounds O
like O
typical O
Menieres B-DIS
. O
I O
have O
been O
symptom O
free O
for O
around O
3 O
years O
and O
recently O
started O
getting O
attacks B-DIS
, O
they O
feel O
as O
though O
the O
world O
and O
your O
head O
is O
spinning O
if O
I O
am O
stood O
up O
I O
will O
usually O
fall O
and O
will O
need O
to O
lie O
down O
in O

stress B-DIS

anxiety B-DIS

general B-DIS

What O
has O
helped O
me O
and O
may O
help O
your O
father O
and O
you O
is O
if O
you O
see O
a O
specialist O
who O
can O
give O
assurances O
and O
check O
to O
ensure O
that O
the O
attacks O
arent O
in O
relation O
to O
anything O
else O
. O
 
It O
IS O
ridiculously O
confusing O
to O
navigate O
. O
It O
gives O
me O
hope O
that O
you O
re O
able O
to O
at O
least O
get O
some O
aspects O
covered O
, O
thank O
you O
for O
sharing O

Man O
people O
are O
dumb O
sometimes O
it O
s O
not O
like O
we O
can O
fully O
control O
if O
we O
are O
going O
to O
be O
low O
or O
not O
. O
I O
had O
someone O

something O

to O
me O
once O

Oy O
My O
wife O
and O
I O
have O
a O
daily O
game O
we O
play O
*que O
dia O
es O
hoy* O
what O
day O
is O
it O
today O
. O
She O
usually O
guesses O
Friday O
because O
our O
doctor O
usually O
schedules O
appointments O
on O
Fridays O
. O
She O
almost O
never O
gets O
it O
right O
, O
but O
it O
at O
least O
gets O
her O
in O
a O
good O
mind-set O
. O
 
Not O
sure O
if O
you O
re O
in O
the O
states O
... O
Or O
if O
unpaid O
leave O
is O
an O
option O
for O
you O
. O
The O
FMLA O
entitles O
eligible O
employees O
of O
covered O
employers O
to O
take O
unpaid O
, O
job-protected O
leave O
for O
specified O
family O
and O
medical O
reasons O
with O
continuation O
of O
group O
health O
insurance O
coverage O
under O
the O
same O
terms O
and O
conditions O
as O
if O
the O
employee O
had O
not O
taken O
leave O
More O
details O
are O
on O
the O
website O

The O
process O
for O
me O
involved O
HR O
but O
they O
dragged O
their O
feet O
and O
I O
quit O
my O
job O
instead O
, O
realizing O
I O
didn O
t O
want O
to O
come O
back O
, O
not O
sure O
how O
quickly O
you O
can O
get O
it O
through O
but O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
asking O
around O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
been O
through O
this O
process O
, O
not O
sure O
if O
you O
need O
a O
lawyer O
to O
back O
you O
if O
they O
try O
to O
pull O
some O
bullshit O
. O
I O
think O
there O
s O
a O
sub O
like O
askalawyer O
or O
similar O
where O
you O
could O
ask O
more O
about O
it O
. O
EDIT O
some O
states O
may O
have O
paid O
family O
leave O
. O
Wherever O
you O
are O
it O
s O
worth O
taking O
a O
look O
. O
I O
m O
sorry O
this O
is O
hitting O
you O
all O
at O
once O
. O
Hang O
in O
there O
. O
 
I O
just O
brought O
a O
bunch O
of O
food O
to O
this O
guy O
s O
place O
to O
make O
myself O
feel O
better O
about O
him O
letting O
me O
stay O
at O
his O
place O
. O
Every O
time O
I O
fuck O
up O
in O
some O
way O
apologising O
never O
feels O
good O
enough O
and O
it O
isn O
t O
good O
enough O
anymore O
anyway O
, O
so O
I O
feel O
I O
have O
to O
make O
it O
up O
by O
buying O
things O
for O
him O
. O
So O
yeah O
I O
do O
it O
to O
make O
people O
like O
and O
appreciate O
me O
more O
and O
I O
also O
used O
to O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
trouble O
with O
it O
when O
he O
didn O
t O
thank O
me O
for O
it O
as O
well O

Hey O
OP O
, O
you O
have O
Lyme B-DIS
Disease I-DIS
Current O
first-line O
testing O
is O
abyssal O
, O
especially O
for O
persistent B-DIS
infections I-DIS
. O
False O
negatives O
are O
extremely O
common O
*The O
Centers O
for O
Disease O
Control O
and O
Prevention O
CDC O
advocates O
a O
2-tier O
testing O
system O
using O
an O
ELISA O
or O
immunofluorescence O
assay O
as O
a O
screening O
test O
, O
followed O
by O
a O
Western O
blot O
for O
confirmation O
if O
the O
result O
of O
the O
ELISA O
or O
immunofluorescence O
assay O
is O
positive O
. O
The O
CDC O
cautions O
, O
however O
, O
that O
the O
2-tier O
system O
should O
only O
be O
used O
for O
surveillance O
purposes O
and O
not O
for O
diagnosis O
, O
and O
the O
reason O
for O
this O
warning O
is O
clear O
although O
the O
2-tier O
system O
has O
a O
very O
high O
specificity O
99 O
100 O
, O
thus O
avoiding O
the O
false-positive O
results O
that O
are O
the O
bane O
of O
surveillance O
statistics O
, O
it O
has O
relatively O
poor O
sensitivity O
50 O
75 O
, O
which O
limits O
its O
use O
as O
a O
diagnostic O
test O
for O
individual O
patients O
... O
.* O
*Other O
problems O
with O
current O
Lyme B-DIS
disease I-DIS
testing O
include O
omission O
of O
highly O
specific O
bands O
from O
the O
commercial O
Western O
blot O
, O
sex O
differences O
in O
test O
reactivity O
, O
and O
limitations O
of O
molecular O
testing O
, O
and O
these O
issues O
have O
been O
discussed O
in O
detail O
elsewhere O

, O
60,61,62 O

. O
Thus O
, O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
Lyme B-DIS
disease I-DIS
remains O
problematic O
, O
with O
as O
many O
as O
one-half O
of O
patients O
experiencing O
failure O
with O
the O
current O
2-tier O
testing O
approach O
. O
* O
The O
flu B-DIS
you O
had O
that O
wouldn O
t O
go O
away O
away O
until O
you O
took O
Cipro B-DRUG
was O
the O
initial O
acute B-DIS
infection I-DIS
. O
A O
significant O
number O
of O
Lyme B-DIS
Disease I-DIS
patients O
never O
notice O
a O
tick B-DIS
bite I-DIS
or O
get O
a O
rash B-DIS
, O
and O
I O
m O
willing O
to O
bet O
you O
re O
one O
of O
them O
. O
The O
fact O
that O
you O
felt O
better O
on O
the O
Doxycycline B-DRUG
aids O
the O
diagnosis O
, O
since O
it O
s O
generally O
first-line O
therapy O
for O
Borreliosis B-DIS
. O
Also O
adding O
credence O
to O
a O
Lyme B-DIS
diagnosis O
is O
the O
fact O
that O
you O
tested O
 
positive O
for O
Mycoplasma B-DIS
, O
a O
common O
tick-borne O
infection B-DIS
that O
is O
often O
trasmitted O
alongside O
Borrelia B-DIS
. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
do O
longer O
term O
antibiotics B-DRUG
, O
you O
ll O
need O
to O
find O
a O
Lyme B-DIS
Literate O
Medical O
Doctor O
. O
If O
you O
re O
in O
the O
US O
, O
you O
ll O
want O
to O
look O
in O
one O
of O
the O
several O
States O
that O
allows O
doctors O
to O
diagnose O
and O
treat O
outside O
of O
IDSA O
Guidelines O
. O
If O
you O
don O
t O
want O
to O
do O
antibiotics B-DRUG
, O
there O
are O
other O
therapies O
you O
may O
find O
helpful O
. O
Take O
care O
 
Thanks O
for O
this O
- O
I O
may O
use O
the O
rehab O
explanation O
when O
I O
need O
to O
move O
my O
dad O
, O
it O
s O
something O
I O
think O
he O
would O
understand O
at O
least O
he O
would O
accept O
is O
as O
an O
explanation O
currently O
. O
 
I O
think O
it O
happened O
many O
times O
but O
one O
of O
the O
worse O
ones O
was O
after O
I O
got O
rejected O
for O
job O
offer O
and O
there O
was O
no O
way O
for O
me O
to O
transfer O
work O
. O
I O
just O
went O
to O
bed O
and O
cried O
myself O
to O
sleep O
. O
I O
managed O
to O
text O
my O
boss O
and O
brother O
that O
I O
couldnt O
come O
to O
work O
then O
just O
stayed O
in O
bed O
the O
whole O
day O
. O
I O
almost O
didnt O
eat O
. O
Afterwards O
, O
of O
course O
I O
still O
have O
to O
function O
because O
I O
had O
to O
fend O
for O
myself O
but O
after O
doing O
the O
usual O
things O
I O
just O
stayed O
in O
bed O
. O
I O
stopped O
socializing O
, O
going O
out O
, O
shopping O
, O
going O
to O
church O
, O
goig O
to O
my O
weekly O
group O
activity O
, O
the O
works O
. O
For O
3 O
months O
. O
 
It O
took O
them O
7 O
years O
to O
find O
my O
crohns B-DIS
. O
And O
i O
was O
pushing O
the O
idea O
of O
crohns B-DIS
for O
all O
those O
seven O
Years O
because O
my O
sister O
has O
it O
. O
They O
found O
out O
when O
i O
was O
rushed O
to O
the O
hospital O
, O
and O
now O
i O
need O
a O
risky O
surgery O
. O
 
This O
was O
my O
post O
. O
I O
m O
newly O
diagnosed O
myself O
, O
so O
I O
don O
t O
have O
a O
whole O
lot O
of O
insight O
to O
offer O
. O
Just O
my O
limited O
personal O
experience O
. O
 
What O
kind O
of O
work O
do O
you O
do O
 
Ill O
let O
u O
all O
know O
. O
I O
get O
so O
frustrated O
with O
him O
. O
I O
figure O
this O
will O
be O
a O
way O
to O
get O
him O
moving O
and O
for O
me O
to O
learn O
more O
patience O
. O
 
Exactly O
why O
I O
didn O
t O
sign O
up O
. O
Imagine O
already O
having O
it O
and O
doing O
that O
. O
People O
who O
go O
to O
space O
tend O
to O
come O
back O
with O
it O
. O
 
Smoothies O
- O
lots O
of O
kale O
, O
spinach O
etc O
with O
almond O
milk O
or O
coconut O
water O
. O
I O
know O
some O
people O
have O
mentioned O
ensure O
drinks O
, O
I O
found O
them O
too O
heavy O
. O
I O
tend O
to O
avoid O
fibrous O
food O
- O
like O
broccoli O
etc O
- O
as O
even O
now O
with O
my O
pacemaker O
it O
can O
cause O
pain B-DIS
and O
vomiting B-DIS
. O
I O
also O
avoid O
starchy O
foods O
like O
white O
potatoes O
, O
I O
find O
sweet O
potato O
is O
easier O
on O
my O
stomach O
. O
Fatty O
foods O
- O
chorizo O
, O
which O
i O
love O
- O
are O
a O
big O
no O
no O
. O
Which O
is O
a O
pain B-DIS
, O
because O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
the O
good O
foods O
For O
me O
, O
it O
s O
a O
case O
of O
being O
sensible O
when O
I O
eat O
and O
trial O
and O
error O
. O
My O
diet O
has O
completely O
changed O
and O
it O
s O
for O
the O
better O
. O
A O
lot O
more O
healthier O
, O
tastier O
and O
better O
for O
my O
gp O
. O
 
I O
find O
for O
me O
that O
even O
85 O
is O
too O
much O
. O
I O
played O
around O
with O
different O
chocolates O
and O
found O
Lindt O
90 O
was O
the O
best O
for O
flavor O
carbs O
. O
It O
is O
expensive O
, O
but O
I O
buy O
it O
in O
twelve O
packs O
from O
Amazon O
, O
which O
lasts O
for O
some O
time O
. O
There O
99 O
is O
also O
good O
in O
small O
doses O
. O
Put O
a O
small O
bit O
in O
your O
mouth O
and O
then O
drink O
some O
hot O
coffee O
. O
Mmmmmmm O
. O
 
gt O
; O
quoted O
text O
is O
like O
chugging O
cold O
water O
with O
a O
mouth O
full O
of O
cavities O
. O
This O
is O
the O
perfect O
description O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
telling O
people O
it O
s O
like O
trying O
to O
blow O
up O
a O
balloon O
that O
is O
already O
full O
of O
acid O
. O
Also O
, O
howdy O
neighbor O
. O
I O
miss O
being O
able O
to O
eat O
at O
Doyle O
s. O
I O
love O
their O
brunch O
. O
 
thats O
interesting O
, O
i O
havent O
heard O
much O
about O
gaining B-DIS
with O
gastroparesis B-DIS
. O
i O
hope O
everything O
goes O
well O
for O
you O
at O
your O
appointment O
and O
they O
figure O
out O
a O
way O
to O
help O
you O
 
I O
was O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
replying O
to O
you O
before O
you O
deleted O
all O
of O
the O

and O
can O
t O

if O
you O

please O
repost O
the O

It O
ll O
be O
useful O
to O
a O

If O

make O

Thanks O
I O
think O
the O
information O
experience O
you O
shared O
is O
important O
enough O
to O
get O
a O
distinguished O
AND O
announced O
post O
, O
two O
things O
I O
rarely O
bother O
to O
do O
since O
my O
default O
Reddit O
client O
doesn O
t O
support O
them O
and O
I O
have O
to O
launch O
a O
browser O
to O
get O
it O
done O
. O
 
I O
LOVE O
this O
This O
is O
the O
mindset O
I O
wanted O
to O
have O
immediately O
after O
the O
rift O
with O
my O
FP O
... O
I O
wanted O
to O
have O
casual O
friendships O
with O
zero O
expectations O
, O
but O
I O
was O
nervous B-DIS
that O
people O
would O
think O
that O
I O
was O
using O
them O
. O
So O
I O
ended O
up O
avoiding O
everyone O
. O
Then O
ended O
up O
shame O
spiraling O
myself O
into O
this O
victim O
mindset O
. O
I O
also O
like O
your O
method O
of O
meeting O
people O
. O
I O
ll O
try O
volunteering O
somewhere- O
my O
workplace O
is O
pretty O
homogenous O
, O
so O
I O
think O
your O
volunteering O
idea O
may O
be O
a O
good O
way O
to O
meet O
a O
diverse O
set O
of O
people O
. O
It O
s O
interesting O
that O
you O
mentioned O
the O
flirting O
aspect- O
when O
I O
was O
relatively O
healthy O
, O
my O
normal O
personality O
had O
been O
mistaken O
for O
flirting O
quite O
a O
few O
times O
. O
Over O
the O
past O
year O
, O
randomly O
without O
warning O
, O
my O
real O
self O
will O
come O
out O
for O
a O
few O
minutes O
and O
I O
find O
myself O
screaming O
inside O
for O
it O
to O
stop O
so O
that O
it O
doesn O
t O
come O
off O
as O
flirting O
. O
Anyway O
, O
thank O
you O
I O
definitely O
feel O
inspired O
 
It O
has O
to O
stay O
up O
. O
If O
it O
goes O
back O
down O
then O
it O
really O
can O
be O
due O
to O
deconditioning O
or O
other O
conditions O
. O
Doesn O
t O
mean O
something O
isn O
t O
wrong O
with O
you O
, O
just O
means O
it O
doesn O
t O
really O
point O
to O
POTS B-DIS
. O
These O
symptoms O
happen O
because O
your O
brain O
needs O
to O
get O
the O
blood O
from O
the O
bottom O
of O
your O
body O
, O
to O
the O
top..and O
your O
heart B-DIS
rate I-DIS
increases I-DIS
because O
of O
it O
, O
and O
stays O
up O
to O
maintain O
that O
. O
Good O
luck O
finding O
answers O
. O
Anxiety B-DIS
surely O
will O
not O
help O
the O
situation O
. O
I O
know O
what O
you O
have O
isn O
t O
caused O
by O
anxiety O
but O
you O
do O
need O
to O
deal O
with O
it O
because O
it O
will O
make O
it O
worse O
. O
 
that O
s O
good O
to O
hear O
. O
make O
sure O
to O
give O
em O
a O
big O
hug O
and O
kiss O
. O
sometimes O
just O
thinking O
of O
how O
grateful O
I O
am O
for O
my O
dog O
grounds O
me O
. O
even O
when O
she O
s O
a O
little O
shit O
who O
yells O
at O
me O
to O
feed O
her O
. O
p O
 
What O
does O
your O
doctor O
or O
pharmacist O
think O
about O
this O
plan O
 
Does O
she O
wear O

I O
find O
that O
my O
levels O
in O
the O
morning O
depend O
on O
a O

of O
factors O
* O
how O
many O

if O
it O
s O
more O
than O
50g O
I O
can O
expect O
a O
liver B-DIS
dump I-DIS
for O
the O
following O
three O
days O
until O
it O
s O
out O
of O
my O
system O
* O
how O
early O
in O
the O
morning O
I O
bolus O
earlier O
smaller O
rise O
* O
how O
well O
I O
slept O
* O
how O
pressured O
I O
feel O
that O
day O
The O
first O
two O
can O
be O
controlled O
so O
that O
s O
what O
I O
try O
and O
do O
every O
day O
. O
I O
also O
have O
made O
an O
effort O
to O
log O
my O
carb O
counts O
and O
boluses O
for O
meals O
- O
while O
the O
result O
isn O
t O
always O
perfect O
, O
the O
act O
of O
doing O
it O
means O
that O
my O
blood O
sugars O
are O
much O
better O
overall O
, O
because O
the O
carb O
counting O
is O
a O
real O
number O
instead O
of O
a O
guess O
. O
So O
, O
this O
is O
what O
I O
do O
* O
Keto O
diet O
, O
preparing O
most O
of O
the O
meals O
myself O
, O
and O
recording O
meals O
on O
My O
Fitness O
Pal O
to O
get O
the O
carb O
counts O
* O
Record O
all O
insulin B-DRUG
doses O
and O
carb O
counts O
on O
my O
Freestyle O
Libre O
, O
which O
forces O
me O
to O
get O
the O
information O
in O
the O
first O
place O
and O
often O
makes O
me O
think O
more O
deeply O
about O
doses O
* O
Set O
an O
early O
alarm O
each O
day O
and O
make O
sure O
I O
ve O
bolused O
by O
a O
certain O
point O
. O
For O
these O
actions O
recording O
on O
MFP O
, O
recording O
on O
meter O
, O
bolusing O
early O
, O
I O
have O
habits O
and O
tasks O
set O
up O
on O
Habitica O
, O
which O
is O
a O
website O
which O
lets O
you O
gamify O
your O
life O
. O
When O
you O
complete O
a O
task O
, O
you O
earn O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
in-game O
credit O
. O
I O
am O
using O
this O
credit O
as O
a O
1 O
1 O
budget O
for O
new O
board O
game O
purchases O
. O
What O
I O
ve O
found O
by O
doing O
this O
is O
that O
I O
 
ve O
been O
able O
to O
flatten O
out O
my O
glucose O
profile O
waiting O
for O
a O
hba1c O
- O
hoping O
it O
ll O
be O
below O
7 O
this O
time O
, O
and O
reduce O
my O
insulin B-DRUG
doses O
by O
being O
more O
efficient O
. O
Maybe O
doing O
these O
things O
will O
help O
you O
, O
I O
don O
t O
know O
. O
It O
seems O
like O
you O
re O
trying O
really O
hard O
. O
I O
do O
think O
if O
you O
start O
recording O
everything O
and O
do O
it O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
you O
ll O
identify O
some O
major O
trends O
which O
might O
explain O
some O
of O
the O
weird O
phenomena O
you O
re O
experiencing O
. O
Also O
I O
got O
swapped O
onto O
Lantus B-DRUG
from O
Levemir B-DRUG
, O
and O
I O
split O
that O
with O
half O
the O
dose O
every O
12 O
hours O
16u O
10am O
16u O
10pm O
. O
I O
found O
that O
this O
helped O
a O
lot O
to O
make O
the O
profile O
flatter O
, O
but O
I O
m O
still O
struggling O
with O
dips O
at O
4am O
4pm O
when O
the O
Lantus B-DRUG
peaks O
. O
 
Yeah O
If O
I O
black B-DIS
out I-DIS
on O
alcohol O
or O
benzos O
, O
I O
m O
pretty O
much O
guaranteed O
to O
wake O
up O
with O
new O
cuts O
. O
Thankfully O
I O
ve O
been O
sober O
and O
SH O
free O
for O
over O
3 O
months O
 
Sometimes O
you O
have O
to O
ask O
for O
what O
you O
need O
. O
You O
can O
t O
always O
blame O
people O
for O
not O
reading O
your O
mind O
about O
what O
you O
want O
 
I O
feel O
for O
you O
. O
We O
ve O
all O
had O
those O
times O
, O
but O
yours O
sounds O
rough O
. O
Remember O
this O
disease O
messes O
with O
your O
mental O
state O
as O
well O
as O
your O
physical O
state O
, O
and O
that O
if O
you O
can O
find O
a O
way O
to O
rest O
for O
long O
enough O
, O
it O
can O
drastically O
change O
your O
outlook O
by O
lifting O
some O
of O
the O
depression B-DIS
caused O
by O
overexertion O
. O
You O
can O
make O
it O
through O
this O
. O
 
If O
you O
are O
talking O
about O
multi-vitamins B-DRUG
, O
protein O
isn O
t O
in O
multi-vitamins B-DRUG
. O
Does O
your O
multi-vitamin O
contain O
iron B-DRUG
 
That O
s O
funny O
, O
I O
mostly O
put O
my O
pod O
on O
my O
thighs O
. O
Never O
had O
a O
problem O
. O
 
Wow O
. O
I O
relate O
. O
This O
is O
my O
first O
time O
on O
this O
sub O
, O
and O
my O
mind O
is O
blown O
. O
Do O
you O
take O
anything O
I O
take O
Prozac B-DRUG
and O
it O
definitely O
helps O
with O
what O
I O
refer O
to O
as O
my O
circling B-DIS
thoughts I-DIS
. O
It O
s O
like O
nonstop O
, O
a O
thousand O
things O
at O
once O
, O
like O
hamsters O
in O
wheels O
and O
it O
drives O
me O
crazy O
. O
The O
problem O
I O
have O
is O
that O
I O
think O
I O
m O
better O
and O
then O
I O
go O
off O
the O
meds O
and O
I O
let O
other O
me O
take O
over O
and O
it O
s O
a O
mess O
. O
I O
hate O
therapy O
too O
. O
I O
can O
t O
really O
say O
anything O
to O
help O
you O
, O
other O
than O
I O
hear O
you O
, O
I O
understand O
and O
you O
re O
not O
alone O
. O
I O
hope O
that O
is O
at O
least O
comforting O
. O
 
Thank O
you O
so O
much O
for O
your O
help O
I O
m O
thinking O
lots O
of O
white O
bread O
, O
exercise O
, O
and O
water O
for O
the O
next O
few O
days O
 
Drips O
are O
awful O
and O
yeah O
clicks O
are O
even O
worse O
I O
like O
white O
noise O
like O
the O
sound O
of O
fans O
for O
instance O
granted O
they O
re O
not O
fucked O
up O
clicking O
but O
one O
time O
my O
ac O
unit O
broke O
and O
it O
made O
this O
awfully O
loud O
constant O
click O
throughout O
the O
house O
and O
it O
almost O
drove O
me O
to O
insanity O
. O
How O
do O
you O
feel O
about O
rain O
I O
personally O
love O
it O
at O
night O
, O
the O
more O
the O
merrier O
Unless O
of O
course O
it O
s O
dripping O
from O
the O
roof O
onto O
a O
puddle O
then O
I O
must O
put O
towels O
down O
. O
 
I O
wrote O
it O
down O
, O
and O
am O
staring O
at O
it O
. O
I O
hope O
it O
works O
eventually O
. O
Deep O
down O
I O
do O
know O
that O
this O
situation O
was O
utter O
nonsense O
from O
the O
start O
. O
 
She O
reads O
the O
numbers O
on O
the O
backs O
of O
packets O
we O
re O
uk O
, O
so O
it O
s O
pretty O
accurate O
and O
she O
s O
weighing O
herself O
. O
She O
reckons O
it O
might O
be O
a O
thyroid B-DIS
problem I-DIS
, O
but O
her O
blood O
tests O
come O
back O
negative O
. O
I O
m O
no O
doctor O
, O
so O
I O
dunno O
what O
that O
means O
though O
 
idk O
what O
communication O
suits O
you O
best O
but O
ask O
if O
you O
want O
to O
use O
something O
more O
private O
 
My O
doctor O
tried O
several O
and O
said O
he O
can O
t O
find O
one O
that O
will O
see O
me O
. O
I O
tried O
a O
few O
on O
my O
own O
as O
well O
but O
none O
of O
them O
will O
see O
me O
. O
 
yes O
i O
feel O
the O
same O
... O
i O
have O
depression B-DIS
, O
suicidal B-DIS
thoughts I-DIS
... O
somtimes O
daily O
 
Never O
go O
out O
without O
headphones O
and O
I O
always O
wonder O
what O
people O
think O
when O
I O
spend O
a O
couple O
minutes O
inevitably O
untangling O
my O
pump O
with O
headphones O
. O
Like O
all O
the O
random O
devices O
I O
carry O
. O
Such O
a O
pain B-DIS
sometimes O
hah O
 
I O
don O
t O
seek O
them O
out O
but O
they O
often O
seem O
to O
be O
drawn O
to O
me O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
five O
serious O
relationships O
, O
of O
which O
one O
was O
full O
NPD B-DIS
, O
one O
probably O
had O
BPD B-DIS
with O
NPD B-DIS
traits I-DIS
, O
and O
another O
had O
relatively O
mild B-DIS
NPD I-DIS
traits O
. O
I O
ve O
learnt O
now O
to O
avoid O
the O
people O
who O
seem O
the O
most O
magnetic O
to O
me O
. O
 
white O
chocolate O
is O
low O
oxalate O
 
My O
restless B-DIS
legs I-DIS
improved O
considerably O
when O
I O
stopped O
spending O
so O
much O
time O
standing O
during O
the O
day O
. O
I O
can O
tell O
I O
ve O
overdone O
when O
I O
feel O
the O
twitchiness B-DIS
start O
when O
I O
lay O
down O
and O
relax O
. O
 
Thats O
nice O
. O
 
I O
worked O
at O
a O
place O
that O
had O
a O
mobile O
x-ray O
service O
. O
X-ray O
machine O
would O
come O
right O
to O
the O
resident O
s O
bed O
Inquire O
around O
if O
such O
a O
service O
exists O
in O
your O
area O
. O
 
I O
think O
it O
s O
awesome O
that O
you O
are O
feeling O
better O
Yeah O
, O
I O
have O
nerve B-DIS
damage I-DIS
and O
symptoms O
are O
much O
more O
disabling O
with O
that O
. O
But O
either O
way O
, O
I O
think O
there O
are O
certain O
markers O
you O
should O
test O
right O
now O
while O
your O
feeling O
well O
. O
Because O
if O
it O
ever O
comes O
back O
and O
is O
worse O
hopefully O
not O
, O
It O
would O
be O
good O
to O
know O
what O
your O
baseline O
is O
to O
know O
where O
things O
went O
of O
the O
rails O
. O
Also O
, O
keep O
in O
mind O
if O
it O
is O
endocrine O
you O
definitely O
want O
to O
check O
these O
levels O
before O
pregnancy O
Let O
me O
know O
if O
you O
want O
names O
of O
blood O
tests O
I O
would O
recommend O
; O
Also O
... O
really O
happy O
you O
are O
doing O
well O
. O
 
I O
never O
mentioned O
disability O
in O
my O
letter O
from O
the O
Dr. O

only O
that O
I O
am O
diagnosed O

soon O

if O
there O

anything O

. O
An O

be O
able O

matter O
. O

2-3 O
times O
when O
I O
eat O
properly O
. O
BMs O

uncomfortable O
to O

. O
 
OMG O
I O
d O
kill O
to O
have O
that O
kind O
of O
energy O
and O
focus O
right O
now O
. O
Does O
anyone O
know O
when O
Dallas O
Texas O
will O
be O
legalizing O
medical B-DRUG
marijuana I-DRUG
 
Peppermint O
tea O

me O
. O
Marshamallow O
root O

the O
bladder O
go O
for O
this O
. O
Some O
do O

frequency O
with O
this O
but O
most O
of O
us O
it O
helps O
. O
 
Just O
wanted O
to O
say O
thanks O
again O
. O
The O
mmj B-DRUG
program O
in O
my O
state O
is O
still O
beginning O
, O
but O
IBS B-DIS
is O
included O
, O
and O
your O
experience O
has O
given O
me O
much O
hope O
. O
I O
am O
thinking O
I O
will O
have O
to O
go O
to O
a O
mmj B-DRUG
doctor O
anyway O
, O
as O
my O
doctors O
definitely O
arent O
up O
to O
speed O
on O
cannabis B-DRUG
. O
Glad O
to O
see O
I O
am O
not O
alone O
 
I O
had O
cramping B-DIS
earlier O
at O
about O
2.40 O
. O
I O
went O
to O
the O
toilet O
and O
that O
made O
things O
better O
. O
I O
kept O
away O
from O
food O
. O
I O
went O
to O
lie O
down O
and O
40 O
minutes O
later O
cramping B-DIS
and O
toilet O
again O
. O
I O
went O
back O
to O
bed O
and O
about O
40 O
minutes O
later O
more O
cramping B-DIS
occurred O
. O
Only O
slight B-DIS
cramps I-DIS
. O
I O
felt O
I O
need O
the O
toilet O
but O
it O
felt O
there O
was O
nothing O
more O
to O
push O
or O
empty O
and O
my O
bum B-DIS
became I-DIS
very I-DIS
sore I-DIS
. O
Hopefully O
this O
will O
be O
end O
of O
it O
for O
the O
day O
. O
Somehow O
I O
doubt O
it O
though O
. O
 
It O
is O
very O
frustrating O
, O
especially O
when O
you O
are O
in O
a O
family O
setting O
and O
should O
feel O
that O
you O
are O
able O
to O
vent O
about O
your O
disease O
. O
Now O
I O
don O
t O
say O
anything O
because O
it O
leads O
back O
to O
, O
I O
saw O
you O
eating O
potato O
chips O
last O
week O
so O
obviously O
you O
don O
t O
want O
to O
change O
things O
I O
don O
t O
mind O
the O
mini O
rant O
, O
it O
s O
nice O
to O
know O
someone O
understands O
 
What O
is O
the O
actual O
surgery O
like O
I O
ve O
been O
curious O
about O
it O
but O
I O
am O
a O
total O
wuss O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
anything O
with O
my O
eyes O
. O
No O
way O
could O
I O
do O
contacts O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
air O
shot O
in O
my O
eyes O
for O
exams O
, O
but O
that O
s O
about O
it O
. O
 
No O
problem O
I O
m O
sure O
a O
thrift O
store O
in O
your O
area O
has O
TONS O
of O
VHS O
tapes O
that O
would O
be O
super O
cheap O
and O
probably O
from O
their O
era O
. O
Good O
luck O
 
YES O
. O
this O
is O
all O
very O
important O
. O
Your O
endo O
should O
be O
willing O
to O
help O
, O
and O
this O
is O
another O
great O
reason O
to O
be O
in O
a O
support O
group O
of O
some O
kind O
. O
ALSO O
SEND O
YOUR O
KID O
TO O
DIABETES B-DIS
CAMP O
 
How O
do O
I O
get O
it O
 
My O
doctors O
won O
t O
give O
me O
any O
prescriptions O
, O
apparently O
all O
my O
levels O
are O
fine O
but O
I O
m O
feeling O
completely O
destroyed O
 
Had O
to O
poop O
at O
work O
way O
more O
times O
than O
the O
average O
person O
would O
run O
to O
the O
bathroom O
during O
a O
shift O
. O
Coworker O
says O
wow O
you O
must O
have O
a O
super O
small O
bladder O
Best O
thing O
to O
do O
in O
that O
moment O
