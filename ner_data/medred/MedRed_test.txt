was O
to O
just O
shrug O
and O
say O
ya O
got O
me O
there O
 
Guess O
I O
was O
really O
lucky O
with O
my O
GI O
, O
he O
s O
amazing O
and O
is O
able O
to O
see O
me O
very O
quickly O
if O
needed O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
had O
any O
luck O
finding O
a O
PCP O
with O
the O
same O
level O
of O
care O
or O
knowledge O
. O
 
That O
s O
very O
sensible O
. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
remove O
all O
credibility O
from O
your O
condition O
, O
go O
get O
one O
of O
those O
free O
auto-positive O
lymes B-DIS
tests O
. O
 
The O
Flomax B-DRUG
relaxes O
the O
plumbing O
and O
makes O
it O
a O
bit O
easier O
for O
a O
stone B-DIS
to O
pass O
. O
Unless O
you O
suspect O
that O
there O
is O
another O
boulder O
on O
the O
way O
, O
I O
would O
stop O
and O
hold O
on O
to O
the O
pills O
just O
in O
case O
you O
have O
another O
episode O
. O
 
I O
take O
30 O
mcg O
of O
Cytomel B-DRUG
and O
have O
to O
split O
it O
into O
3 O
doses O
throughout O
the O
day O
. O
If O
you O
check O
their O
website O
, O
it O
can O
be O
taken O
with O
or O
without O
food O
. O
Just O
be O
careful O
of O
calcium O
or O
iron O
-- O
in O
food O
that O
should O
be O
at O
least O
2 O
hrs O
from O
the O
Cytomel B-DRUG
, O
and O
as O
supplements O
as O
in O
my O
multivitamin O
, O
it O
needs O
to O
be O
4 O
hours O
away O
. O
 
I O
have O
no O
idea O
, O
tbh O
. O
Is O
it O
vascular O
Is O
it O
diet O
related O
Too O
much O
salt O
, O
too O
much O
sugar O
Is O
it O
anatomic B-DIS
anomalies I-DIS
Sinus B-DIS
issues I-DIS
Probs O
all O
of O
it O
. O
All O
I O
know O
is O
I O
would O
like O
to O
be O
a O
little O
less O
limited O
on O
how O
much O
I O
can O
choose O
to O
enjoy O
my O
day O
based O
on O
sudden O
symptoms O
. O
 
I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
had O
the O
option O
, O
but O
I O
don O
t O
like O
oatmeal O
so O
it O
would O
have O
been O
50 O
50 O
. O
It O
s O
still O
fun O
to O
tell O
everyone O
you O
had O
to O
eat O
radioactive O
oatmeal O
or O
eggs O
, O
makes O
it O
sound O
much O
more O
impressive O
than O
it O
actually O
is O
. O
Here O
s O
a O
pic O
of O
the O
machine O
they O
used O
on O
me O
4 O
yeas O
ago O
. O
IIRC O
, O
the O
ring O
portion O
moves O
over O
to O
your O
stomach O
, O
then O
the O
blue O
part O
rotates O
around O
you O
. O
It O
s O
bigger O
and O
not O
enclosed O
like O
an O
MRI O
and O
not O
nearly O
as O
loud O
. O
 
I O
have O
the O
starter O
going O
in O
my O
new O
dehydrator O
. O
Hoping O
for O
solidity O
in O
the O
morning O
. O
 
gt O
; O
Its O
true O
that O
such O
sizes O
can O
pass O
, O
however O
I O
am O
skeptical O
that O
this O
one O
will O
given O
that O
in O
imagery O
it O
is O
exactly O
where O
they O
always O
get O
stuck O
And O
where O
, O
according O
to O
that O
link O
I O
gave O
, O
there O
is O
still O
a O
48 O
the O
stone B-DIS
will O
pass O
. O
It O
gives O
the O
chance O
as O
size O
and O
location O
. O
Either O
way O
, O
well O
above O
5 O
. O
 
PM O
me O
if O
you O
need O
help O
with O
this O
, O
I O
ve O
overcome O
tinnitus B-DIS
and O
don O
t O
notice O
it O
much O
anymore O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
are O
doing O
okay O
 
Dementia B-DIS
can O
be O
truly O
heartbreaking O
to O
see O
, O
and O
I O
m O
sorry O
to O
hear O
what O
you O
re O
going O
through O
. O
If O
I O
could O
make O
a O
suggestion O
it O
would O
be O
to O
ask O
the O
staff O
looking O
after O
her O
when O
she O
s O
most O
comfortable O
and O
relaxed O
, O
and O
try O
to O
arrange O
a O
visit O
for O
then O
. O
Yes O
, O
it O
can O
be O
incredibly O
difficult O
to O
see O
loved O
ones O
in O
such O
a O
confused B-DIS
state I-DIS
, O
but O
there O
will O
still O
be O
part O
of O
them O
there O
and O
crucially O
they O
are O
still O
a O
person O
. O
If O
you O
can O
talk O
to O
them O
about O
something O
they O
have O
always O
loved O
, O
bring O
them O
food O
that O
they O
enjoy O
, O
or O
even O
sit O
there O
and O
hold O
their O
hand O
, O
it O
can O
still O
give O
that O
person O
some O
joy O
for O
a O
few O
moments O
. O
 
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
GERD B-DIS
before O
GP B-DIS
i O
was O
literally O
diagnosed O
with O
GP O
two O
days O
ago O
so O
i O
m O
still O
learning O
, O
but O
orange O
juice O
with O
pulp O
aka O
my O
favorite O
thing O
had O
to O
be O
taken O
away O
because O
the O
acid B-DIS
made I-DIS
me I-DIS
vomit I-DIS
. O
I O
think O
that O
in O
particular O
is O
more O
related O
to O
GERD O
than O
GP O
could O
be O
wrong O
, O
like O
i O
said O
I O
m O
learning O
, O
but O
. O
I O
don O
t O
seem O
to O
have O
any O
issues O
with O
many O
other O
fruits O
that O
I O
ve O
noticed O
, O
but O
then O
again O
I O
don O
t O
eat O
as O
much O
of O
them O
as O
I O
drank O
orange O
juice O
. O
 
Same O
. O
Those O
moments O
are O
amazing O
, O
and O
the O
people O
who O
experience O
them O
with O
me O
*notice O
immediately* O
so O
I O
make O
the O
best O
of O
it O
. O
And O
take O
pictures O
. O
 
i O
was O
doing O
them O
in O
my O
stomach O
when O
younger O
and O
it O
developed O
a O
pudge O
so O
i O
went O
to O
butt O
and O
hips O
, O
got O
ta O
stay O
sexy O
for O
summer O
. O
 
Thanks O
for O
your O
post O
. O
I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
I O
have O
EDS B-DIS
though O
I O
may O
since O
I O
m O
definitely O
hyper B-DIS
flexible I-DIS
. O
I O
was O
wondering O
, O
if O
you O
have O
MVP B-DIS
would O
it O
be O
caught O
during O
a O
routine O
physical O
when O
they O
listen O
to O
your O
heart O
with O
a O
stethoscope O
Because O
the O
doctor O
s O
listened O
to O
my O
heart O
. O
But O
I O
looked O
up O
MVP B-DIS
and O
it O
said O
it O
can O
cause O
congestive B-DIS
heart I-DIS
failure I-DIS
. O
The O
thing O
is O
I O
think O
it O
s O
possible O
I O
have O
the O
symptoms O
of O
congestive B-DIS
heart I-DIS
failure I-DIS
. O
I O
also O
may O
have O
neurally B-DIS
mediated I-DIS
hypotension I-DIS
. O
You O
post O
links O
both O
MVP B-DIS
and O
dysautonomia B-DIS
, O
and O
thereby O
describes O
a O
situation O
where O
someone O
might O
have O
something O
physically O
wrong O
with O
their O
heart O
and O
something O
wrong O
with O
the O
communication O
between O
their O
brain O
and O
their O
heart O
. O
 
Thanks O
- O
I O
love O
peanuts O
and O
cheese O
. O
Many O
kidney B-DIS
stones I-DIS
. O
 
I O
used O
to O
live O
in O
NJ O
, O
so O
I O
m O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
you O
re O
stuck O
in O
this O
situation O
. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
GP B-DIS
about O
a O
week O
ago O
, O
after O
months O
of O
tests O
dating O
back O
to O
August O
. O
MMJ B-DRUG
is O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
helps O
me O
. O
I O
live O
in O
CA O
now O
so O
I O
have O
been O
using O
edibles O
mainly O
. O
I O
eat O
these O
candies O
called O
paradise O
ranchers O
basically O
a O
jolly O
rancher O
. O
They O
have O
indica O
and O
sativa O
versions O
. O
I O
usually O
stick O
to O
indica O
because O
it O
dulls O
that O
pain O
and O
allows O
me O
to O
eat O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
anything O
that O
is O
Indica O
dominant O
worked O
for O
me O
. O
Again O
I O
know O
it O
s O
going O
to O
be O
tough O
to O
get O
a O
hold O
of O
these O
things O
in O
NJ O
, O
but O
maybe O
try O
taking O
a O
trip O
to O
Colorado O
or O
some O
place O
where O
it O
is O
legal O
. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
talk O
further O
, O
send O
me O
a O
PM O
. O
Best O

Good O
luck O
Sounds O
like O
your O
family O
member O
is O
lucky O
to O
have O
you O
and O
your O
caring O
heart O
looking O
out O
for O
her O
Take O
care O
of O
yourself O
too O
... O
we O
can O
not O
serve O
from O
an O
empty O
vessel O
 
Oh O
yes O
, O
the O
negging O
That O
is O
something O
I O
get O
from O
my O
dad O
- O
it O
is O
done O
so O
he O
can O
demonstrate O
some O
way O
he O
is O
in O
control O
and O
knows O
better O
than O
everyone O
else O
. O
I O
tend O
to O
ask O
politely O
about O
the O
problem O
and O
offer O
to O
fix O
something O
else O
, O
but O
otherwise O
leave O
it O
show O
him O
that O
you O
are O
actually O
paying O
attention O
to O
him O
. O
NOTE O
negging O
about O
food O
could O
mean O
something O
significant O
, O
like O
he O
is O
having O
trouble B-DIS
handling I-DIS
cutlery I-DIS
so O
pay O
attention O
to O
what O
he O
is O
NOT O
eating O
because O
you O
may O
need O
to O
provide O
food O
in O
bite-sized O
pieces O
. O
So O
this O
has O
been O
going O
on O
for O
a O
while O
I O
would O
ignore O
any O
arguing O
about O
professional O
care O
and O
get O
someone O
in O
to O
take O
some O
pressure O
off O
you O
. O
Most O
professional O
carers O
have O
two O
4 O
hour O
visits O
a O
week O
minimum O
. O
This O
can O
be O
done O
in O
the O
morning O
or O
afternoon O
when O
he O
naps O
. O
The O
other O
thing O
is O
that O
this O
is O
a O
new O
person O
who O
can O
maybe O
distract O
him O
or O
get O
him O
interested O
in O
different O
things O
. O
You O
should O
not O
lose O
your O
job O
because O
of O
agreeing O
to O
someone O
who O
does O
not O
have O
the O
ability O
to O
understand O
the O
consequences O
of O
his O
demands O
. O
Also O
, O
burnout B-DIS
is O
a O
serious O
problem O
- O
get O
some O
help O
. O
 
Oops O
, O
my O
last O
was O
5.7 O
, O
I O
forgot O
to O
update O
. O
And O
dex B-DRUG
and O
omni B-DRUG
are O
great O
, O
but O
any O
pump O
cgm O
is O
more O
efficient O
than O
mdi O
if O
you O
are O
really O
about O
control O
. O
 
Presyncope B-DIS
upon I-DIS
sitting I-DIS
or I-DIS
standing I-DIS
. O
The O
desat O
because O
while O
unconscious O
, O
I O
stopped B-DIS
breathing I-DIS
and O
others O
around O
me O
told O
me O
my O
lips B-DIS
and I-DIS
eyelids I-DIS
were I-DIS
turning I-DIS
blue I-DIS
. O
And O
also O
I O
can O
t O
breathe O
moments O
before O
I O
lose B-DIS
consciousness I-DIS
. O
My O
whole B-DIS
body I-DIS
is I-DIS
paralyzed I-DIS
and O
I O
m O
usually O
wheezing B-DIS
moment O
before O
I O
can O
t O
take O
anymore O
breaths O
 
Family O
and O
medical O
leave O
act O
which O
is O
a O
federal O
law O
that O
guarantees O
employees O
up O
to O
12 O
weeks O
of O
unpaid O
leave O
each O
year O
with O
no O
threat O
of O
job O
loss O
. O
FMLA O
also O
requires O
that O
employers O
covered O
by O
the O
law O
maintain O
the O
health O
benefits O
for O
eligible O
workers O
just O
as O
if O
they O
were O
working O
. O
 
Definitely O
sounds O
like O
he O
needs O
more O
care O
, O
likely O
24 O
7 O
. O
That O
being O
said O
, O
sometimes O
a O
UTI B-DIS
or O
another O
infection B-DIS
can O
cause O
very O
sudden O
changes B-DIS
in I-DIS
behavior I-DIS
. O
Like O
you O
also O
said O
, O
a O
change O
in O
routine O
can O
also O
cause O
changes B-DIS
in I-DIS
behaviors I-DIS
. O
He O
should O
get O
checked O
out O
by O
a O
doctor O
, O
and O
really O
push O
for O
a O
dementia B-DIS
specialist O
who O
is O
skilled O
at O
prescribing O
appropriate O
medications O
. O
I O
can O
not O
imagine O
the O
insane O
difficulty O
that O
would O
arise O
in O
dealing O
with O
dementia B-DIS
without O
medication O
. O
Medication O
can O
make O
a O
tremendous O
difference O
in O
their O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
 
I O
know O
this O
may O
not O
be O
your O
angle O
, O
but O
it O
has O
gotten O
me O
through O
a O
lot O
in O
life O
to O
politely O
face O
people O
. O
I O
honestly O
would O
knock O
on O
their O
door O
with O
my O
guitar O
, O
and O
serenade O
them O
on O
how O
much O
I O
still O
love O
them O
despite O
their O
complete O
lack O
of O
empathy O
to O
the O
huge O
fucking O
roadblocks O
you O
face O
in O
life O
. O
And O
I O
know O
you O
don O
t O
like O
my O
guitar O
, O
But O
imagine O
if O
your O
fingers B-DIS
were I-DIS
always I-DIS
numb I-DIS
, O
and O
people O
though O
your O
disability O
made O
you O
dumb O
- O
Do O
you O
think O
you O
d O
get O
this O
far O
Walk O
back O
inside O
. O
 
Thanks O
. O
The O
really O
messed O
up O
thing O
is O
that O
my O
GP B-DIS
is O
nowhere O
even O
near O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
people O
have O
it O
Perspective O
, O
hey O
 
Yep O
, O
I O
get O
mild B-DIS
flares I-DIS
at O
that O
time O
of O
the O
month O
. O
I O
ve O
just O
come O
off O
the O
pill O
and O
am O
flaring B-DIS
really O
bad O
. O
 
Interesting O
, O
thanks O
. O
So O
how O
do O
people O
with O
POTS B-DIS
know O
it O
s O
really O
POTS B-DIS
vs O
dehydration B-DIS
Wouldn O
t O
hydrating O
also O
help O
relieve O
real O
POTS B-DIS
symptoms O
too O
 
What O
s O
the O
realistic O
timeline O
for O
something O
like O
this O
if O
it O
s O
approved O
 
Like O
the O
Rick O
and O
Morty O
quote O
Nobody O
exists O
on O
purpose O
, O
nobody O
belongs O
anywhere O
, O
everybody O
s O
going O
to O
die B-DIS
 
I O
have O
gastroparesis B-DIS
. O
Thankfully O
it O
s O
still O
only O
happening O
intermittently O
at O
this O
point O
and O
I O
m O
controlling O
it O
best O
I O
can O
with O
antibiotics B-DRUG
, O
probiotics B-DRUG
and O
watching O
what O
I O
eat O
. O
But O
flare B-DIS
ups I-DIS
are O
a O
nightmare O
. O
Before O
I O
knew O
what O
it O
was O
I O
was O
hospitalised O
for O
a O
week O
with O
the O
pain B-DIS
. O
They O
had O
taken O
an O
x-ray O
down O
in O
A O
amp O
; O
E O
before O
they O
admitted O
me O
and O
they O
were O
all O
we O
think O
you O
re O
just O
constipated B-DIS
but O
we O
will O
bring O
you O
in O
for O
a O
day O
or O
two O
just O
to O
be O
on O
the O
safe O
side O
. O
They O
gave O
me O
stuff O
to O
go O
and O
by O
that O
night O
I O
had O
the O
runs B-DIS
. O
Pain B-DIS
was O
still O
unbearable O
to O
the O
ppint O
that O
I O
was O
hunched O
over O
my O
bed O
crying O
. O
I O
told O
the O
nurse O
about O
having O
been O
to O
the O
loo O
and O
it O
making O
no O
difference O
and O
I O
hadn O
t O
slept O
in O
2 O
days O
from O
the O
pain B-DIS
. O
She O
git O
the O
doc O
to O
give O
me O
morphine B-DRUG
and O
I O
finally O
slept O
. O
Next O
day O
, O
pain B-DIS
still O
as O
bad O
and O
after O
telling O
yet O
another O
nurse O
that O
I O
didn O
t O
want O
the O
movicol B-DRUG
they O
kept O
trying O
to O
give O
me O
cuz O
I O
still O
had O
the O
runs O
*another* O
nurse O
came O
by O
to O
take O
my O
canula O
out O
and O
said O
we O
ll O
get O
this O
out O
and O
send O
you O
home O
with O
some O
movicol B-DRUG
, O
you O
ll O
feel O
much O
better O
after O
you O
manage O
to O
go O
to O
the O
toilet O
. O
I O
couldn O
t O
believe O
it O
. O
I O
was O
like O
Hello O
Is O
anyone O
actually O
listening O
to O
me O
I O
m O
not O
bloody O
constipated B-DIS
- O
I O
m O
the O
total O
opposite O
of O
****ing O
constipated B-DIS
Boy O
was O
I O
pissed O
off O
. O
In O
agony O
and O
NO O
ONE O
was O
actually O
listening O
to O
a O
damn O
word O
I O
was O
saying O
. O
After O
that O
I O
got O
an O
endescopy O
and O
scans O
 
but O
it O
didn O
t O
show O
anything O
. O
Obviously O
by O
then O
it O
had O
been O
days O
since O
I O
d O
eaten O
anything O
. O
 
try O
eating O
some O
food O
with O
fat O
amp O
; O
carbs O
in O
it O
 
That O
s O
my O
mommom O
too O
. O
She O
s O
become O
agoraphobic B-DIS
largely O
because O
she O
s O
embarrassed O
for O
people O
to O
see O
her O
struggle B-DIS
to I-DIS
eat I-DIS
. O
But O
she O
also O
refuses O
to O
use O
assistive O
utensils O
that O
counteract O
the O
tremors B-DIS
based O
on O
the O
principle O
that O
she O
ll O
still O
be O
shaking B-DIS
. O
Then O
she O
s O
worried O
she O
ll O
get O
lost O
if O
she O
has O
an O
episode O
, O
even O
though O
we O
all O
promise O
to O
keep O
with O
her O
, O
so O
clearly O
she O
s O
just O
embarrassed O
to O
be O
seen O
having O
an O
episode O
. O
So O
glad O
you O
re O
trying O
to O
help O
lessen O
the O
stigma O
. O
I O
too O
am O
amazed O
by O
how O
many O
family O
members O
even O
will O
say O
things O
behind O
one O
s O
back O
about O
their O
disability O
. O
 
... O
oh O
my O
God O
. O
Could O
we O
get O
an O
update O
on O
how O
you O
re O
doing O
now O
That O
is O
an O
extreme O
amount O
of O
poop O
in O
you O
, O
and O
I O
can O
t O
believe O
the O
doctors O
were O
so O
blase O
about O
it O
all O
 
Huh O
, O
is O
that O
the O
reason O
some O
people O
get O
a O
spike O
when O
they O
exercise O
Mine O
always O
rises O
sharply O
and O
drops O
again O
right O
after O
. O
Never O
realized O
it O
could O
be O
a O
fake O
high O
. O
 
Depending O
on O
where O
you O
work O
and O
your O
local O
laws O
, O
you O
might O
be O
able O
to O
get O
it O
recognized O
as O
a O
disability O
if O
you O
re O
ever O
given O
any O
trouble O
. O
I O
don O
t O
have O
IBS-D B-DIS
but O
something O
else O
forced O
me O
to O
the O
bathroom O
like O
every O
hour O
or O
more O
for O
a O
while O
and O
I O
just O
explained O
that O
it O
was O
due O
to O
a O
health O
issue O
at O
my O
then-job O
wasn O
t O
a O
new O
job O
though O
. O
Never O
had O
any O
problem O
. O
I O
was O
performing O
well O
otherwise O
, O
so O
that O
likely O
also O
contributed O
. O
 
Do O
you O
know O
what O
they O
re O
basing O
that O
on O
What O
sort O
of O
links O
are O
there O
between O
MS B-DIS
and O
IF B-DIS
 
Doesn O
t O
look O
like O
psoriasis B-DIS
to O
me O
. O
The O
nail B-DIS
gets I-DIS
thicker I-DIS
and O
the O
underside B-DIS
discolors I-DIS
. O
I O
ve O
never O
seen O
the O
top O
layer O
peel O
off O
with O
psoriasis B-DIS
, O
but O
I O
m O
also O
not O
a O
doctor O
. O
Like O
anything O
medical O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
get O
a O
doctor O
to O
diagnose O
that O
. O
 
Thank O
you O
, O
really O
appreciate O
your O
reply O
. O
Did O
another O
MSU O
sample O
in O
the O
end O
after O
I O
told O
the O
doctor O
I O
was O
really O
uncomfortable O
. O
 
I O
ate O
some O
ramen O
during O
a O
TERRIBLE O
flare B-DIS
up I-DIS
I O
was O
having O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
. O
Definitely O
made O
it O
worse O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
I O
only O
added O
about O
half O
of O
the O
packet O
. O
They O
seem O
light O
and O
like O
a O
small O
meal O
, O
but O
the O
seasoning O
packets O
always O
contain O
a O
ridiculous O
amount O
of O
salt O

Autoimmune O

Sarah O
ballentyne O
wrote O
a O
book O
explaining O
the O
whole O
thing O
called O
The O
paleo O
Approach O
. O
There O
is O
a O
great O
ketogenic O
diet O
with O
emphasis O
on O
high O
nutrient O
density O
called O
the O
wahls O
protocol O
by O
Terri O
wahls O
, O
md O
. O
 
I O
get O
bad O
goosebumps B-DIS
when O
I O
m O
in O
pain B-DIS
. O
Not O
so O
much O
shivering B-DIS
, O
though O
. O
 
Try O
excluding O
wheat O
as O
a O
start O
... O
if O
the O
whole O
fodmap O
list O
feels O
overwhelming O
 
Morphine B-DRUG
barely O
does O
anything O
for O
me O
in O
the O
hospital O
setting O
. O
There O
are O
only O
two O
drugs O
that O
are O
effective O
. O
One O
is O
Dilaudid B-DRUG
hydromorphone B-DRUG
, O
which O
makes B-DIS
me I-DIS
puke I-DIS
. O
Second O
is O
Toradol B-DRUG
ketorolac B-DRUG
which O
is O
a O
much O
better O
alternative O
and O
just O
as O
effective O
without O
the O
nausea B-DIS
and O
vomiting B-DIS
. O
I O
ve O
passed B-DIS
about I-DIS
40 I-DIS
stones I-DIS
starting O
back O
when O
I O
was O
a O
teenager O
. O
I O
m O
48 O
now O
. O
Here O
s O
my O
most O
recent O
experience O
 
That O
s O
good O
to O
hear O
. O
I O
am O
happy O
I O
am O
able O
to O
start O
PT O
because O
that O
is O
something O
I O
think O
will O
benefit O
any O
woman O
my O
age O
, O
especially O
if O
they O
ve O
had O
kids O
. O
I O
ve O
also O
read O
that O
yoga O
or O
pilates O
helps O
, O
so O
I O
am O
going O
to O
continue O
doing O
that O
at O
home O
for O
now O
, O
too O
. O
 
Oh O
yea O
, O
if O
I O
avoid O
FODMAPs O
I O
m O
pretty O
good O
and O
don O
t O
have O
issues O
. O
But O
there O
are O
other O
foods O
drinks O
that O
aren O
t O
FODMAP O
and O
can O
mess O
me O
up O
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O
 
Good O
luck O
My O
girlfriend O
literally O
quit O
everything O
. O
I O
think O
stress B-DIS
is O
a O
huge O
factor O
but O
low O
sodium O
definitely O
did O
the O
trick O
. O
She O
cut O
dairy O
and O
gluten O
too O
. O
 
I O
completely O
understand O
At O
my O
worst O
I O
weighed O
110 O
5 O
4 O
and O
literally O
had O
people O
asking O
how O
they O
could O
get O
gastroparesis B-DIS
. O
Ugh O
 
Your O
experience O
sounds O
very O
similar O
He O
walks O
with O
a O
cane O
fairly O
ok O
, O
but O
yes O
, O
he O
can O
only O
go O
so O
far O
. O
We O
went O
Christmas O
shopping O
together O
and O
went O
from O
bench O
to O
bench O
for O
breaks O
, O
which O
actually O
made O
the O
whole O
experience O
more O
relaxed O
than O
usual O
One O
thing O
I O
ve O
learned O
is O
planning O
ahead O
of O
time O
is O
key O
. O
I O
m O
happy O
to O
hear O
about O
your O
experience O
and O
hope O
the O
same O
for O
my O
boyfriend O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O
with O
everything O
 
Switching O
to O
Carbidopa B-DRUG
Levodopa B-DRUG
should O
help O
with O
the O
impulse B-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O
Dopamine-Agonist B-DRUG
Are O
great O
drugs O
for O
80 O
of O
the O
people O
with O
Parkinson O
s O
, O
but O
for O
the O
other O
20 O
can O
make O
our O
lives O
living O
hell O
from O
odd B-DIS
compulsive I-DIS
behaviors I-DIS
. O
I O
can O
not O
begin O
to O
explain O
how O
beneficial O
exercise O
is O
. O
I O
love O
my O
Rock O
Steady O
Boxing O

feeling O
comfortable O
to O
go O
walking O
two O
miles O
forty O
minutes O
-- O
doing O
good O
with O
my O
faithful O
Golden O
Retriever O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
to O
fight O
depression B-DIS
. O
 
I O
am O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
Glad O
that O
you O
found O
the O
cause O
, O
though O
, O
and O
are O
out O
of O
the O
hospital O
. O
I O
d O
be O
curious O
to O
hear O
if O
your O
GI O
amp O
; O
neurologist O
as O
a O
team O
are O
able O
to O
come O
up O
with O
any O
creative O
solutions O
for O
you O
. O
I O
hope O
they O
do O
- O
fill O
me O
in O
if O
you O
have O
the O
chance O
 
Maybe O
try O
exercise O
if O
you O
re O
not O
Less O
saturated O
fat O
more O
unsaturated O
fat O
too O
 
In O
times O
I O
ve O
spent O
uninsured O
- O
I O
will O
actually O
only O
eat O
once O
a O
day O
to O
help O
control O
my O
insulin B-DIS
usage O
. O
 
Definitely O
see O
a O
neurologist O
Also O
, O
eat O
as O
little O
salt O
as O
possible O
. O
Salt O
exacerbates O
Merniere O
s O
and O
other O
inner B-DIS
ear I-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O
Stress B-DIS
does O
as O
well O
. O
Not O
sure O
how O
much O
you O
can O
avoid O
stress B-DIS
in O
a O
medical O
field O
, O
but O
relaxing O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can O
will O
help O
. O
Getting O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
some O
kind O
will O
at O
least O
help O
in O
that O
you O
ll O
know O
what O
s O
up O
and O
you O
have O
some O
legal O
recourse O
regarding O
jobs O
, O
benefits O
, O
etc O
. O
 
I O
really O
liked O
your O
blog O
post O
about O
cats O
with O

even O
though O
it O
was O
tough O
to O
read O

t O
worry O
about O
that O

People O

with O

and O
substance B-DIS
abuse I-DIS
, O
exacerbated O
by O
the O
dopamine B-DRUG
agonist I-DRUG
drugs I-DRUG
. O
My O
husband O
was O
only O
on O
one O
for O
8 O
months O
until O
the O
excessive O
addictive O
computer O
coding O
caused O
us O
to O
switch O
to O
l-dopa B-DRUG
and O
he O
s O
39 O
PD B-DIS
is O
one O
of O
the O
better O
diseases O
bc O
there O
are O
good O
therapies- O
sinemet B-DRUG
, O
DBS B-DRUG
, O
and O
more O
coming O
. O
 
Check O
and O
see O
if O
Humira B-DRUG
has O
a O
patient O
assistance O
program O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
biological O
companies O
offer O
monetary O

lol O
, O
that O
s O
why O
my O
username O
is O
majesticleper O

I O
embrace O
it O
. O
I O
have O
always O
been O
a O
member O
of O
various O
alternative O
view O
points O
so O
having O
some O
visible O
Psoriasis B-DIS
on O
my O
face O
hasn O
t O
bothered O
me O
too O
much O
... O
some O
people O
ask O
me O
like O
it O
is O
an O
injury O
of O
some O
kind O
and O
then O
I O
tell O
them O
that O
I O
fell O
into O
a O
vat O
of O
acid O
like O
the O
Joker O
did O
. O
I O
don O
t O
have O
any O
useful O
advise O
for O
you O
or O
him O
, O
but O
therapy O
is O
probably O
going O
to O
be O
helpful O
, O
if O
he O
has O
the O
right O
therapist O
. O
Where O
is O
his O
psoriasis B-DIS
Is O
it O
possible O
to O
cover O
it O
or O
distract O
from O
it O
somehow O
I O
don O
t O
think O
that O
is O
healthy O
behavior O
, O
but O
it O
may O
be O
something O
you O
could O
do O
for O
the O
trip O
, O
just O
to O
get O
through O
it O
... O
I O
dunno O
. O
Good O
luck O
The O

Vertigo B-DIS
is O
the O
worst O
, O
I O
had O
a O
huge O
episode O
20years O
ago O
and O
nothing O
that O
I O
can O
recall O
of O
any O
note O
until O
6 O
weeks O
ago O
when O
it O
came O
back O
and O
my O
tinittus B-DIS
increased O
and O
I O
lost B-DIS
almost I-DIS
all I-DIS
my I-DIS
hearing I-DIS
in I-DIS
that I-DIS
same I-DIS
ear I-DIS
. O
Walking B-DIS
around I-DIS
like I-DIS
I I-DIS
was I-DIS
drunk I-DIS
without O
the O
fun O
and O
every O
time O
I O
lay O
back O
getting B-DIS
the I-DIS
spins I-DIS
. O
Had O
an O
MRI O
which O
was O
clear O
, O
didn O
t O
bother O
with O
any O
more O
tests O
as O
it O
could O
end O
up O
costing O
up O
to O
5k O
dollars O
if O
an O
operation O
was O
needed O
. O
I O
think O
it O
s O
meniers B-DIS
it O
seems O
to O
fit O
all O
the O
symptoms O
so O
I O
m O
going O
to O
start O
a O
low O
Sodium O
diet O
and O
reduce O
caffeine O
intake O
and O
increase O
water O
intake O
as O
the O
last O
few O
days O
I O
ve O
had O
one B-DIS
attack I-DIS
and O
slight B-DIS
dizziness I-DIS
. O
Thankfully O
I O
haven O
t O
had O
migraines B-DIS
. O
Have O
you O
had O
a O
CT O
scan O
to O
check O
for O
Otosclerosis B-DIS
 
Nsaids B-DRUG
all O
of O
them O
. O
I O
m O
am O
covered O
in O
bruises B-DIS
. O
Robaxin B-DRUG
for O
the O
muscle O
relaxer O
. O
I O
had O
been O
prescribed O
soma B-DRUG
from O
ortho O
which O
is O
very O
sedating O
and O
have O
taken O
as O
last O
resort O
. O
Currently O
out O
of O
that O
prescription O
. O
I O
m O
just O
laying O
around O
. O
I O
can O
surf O
Internet O
with O
my O
dumb O
left O
hand O
. O
I O
am O
so O
depressed B-DIS
. O
Anytime O
you O
go O
to O
urgent O
care O
or O
ER O
for O
pain O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
will O
be O
immediately O
judged O
. O
Tramadol B-DRUG
makes O
me O
very O
teary O
and O
sad O
. O
I O
just O
hope O
each O
day O
it O
will O
be O
better O
but O
I O
seem O
to O
worsen O
. O
 
lol O
, O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
get O
your O
attention O
without O
commenting B-DIS
the O
same O
link O
twice O
. O
P O
And O
yeah O
I O
m O
going O
to O
try O
a O
DIY O
FMT O
hopefully O
soon O
, O
with O
a O
screened O
donor O
and O
the O
blessing O
of O
my O
gastroenterologist O
. O
He O
s O
actually O
tying O
to O
get O
me O
a O
sample O
from O
a O
local O
hospital O
that O
they O
use O
for O
C. B-DIS
Diff B-DIS
. O
I O
think O
it O
s O
one O
of O
the O
few O
options O
left O
to O
me O
that O
might O
actually O
address O
the O
underlying O
issue O
 
**Have O
your O
own O
lifestyles O
and O
ideals O
** O
 
Hmmmm O
. O
Yes O
, O
technically O
the O
side O
effects O
you O
list O
can O
be O
seen O
with O
diuretics O
but O
if O
you O
are O
young O
less O
than O
70 O
and O
otherwise O
healthy O
you O
probably O
won O
t O
experience O
much O
or O
anything O
like O
them O
. O
I O
took O
several O
diuretics O
for O
years O
- O
some O
as O
a O
baseline O
such O
a O
HCTZ O
and O
some O
as O
a O
rescue O
drug O
lasix B-DRUG
. O
some O
were O
in O
pretty O
severe O
doses O
. O
I O
never O
had O
any O
of O
the O
symptoms O
you O
list O
here O
. O
The O
potassium O
supplements O
are O
a O
little O
concerning O
. O
If O
I O
were O
you O
I O
would O
ask O
my O
primary O
care O
physician O
about O
the O
addition O
of O
potassium O
. O
Keep O
in O
mind O
, O
an O
ENT O
prescribing O
diuretics O
is O
like O
your O
car O
s O
mechanic O
painting O
the O
side O
- O
he O
might O
have O
a O
rough O
idea O
how O
, O
it O
s O
just O
not O
something O
he O
does O
every O
day O
. O
As O
to O
salt O
- O
the O
single O
best O
recommendation O
I O
can O
give O
someone O
with O
MD O
is O
to O
download O
and O
use O
MyFitnessPal O
. O
Set O
your O
sodium O
limit O
and O
then O
enter O
every O
single O
thing O
you O
eat O
every O
day O
. O
In O
a O
matter O
of O
days O
you O
will O
begin O
to O
see O
how O
much O
salt O
you O
actually O
get O
and O
when O
. O
Yes O
, O
your O
total O
salt O
intake O
is O
important O
, O
but O
boluses O
of O
salt O
a O
bunch O
all O
at O
one O
sitting O
are O
actually O
more O
likely O
to O
induce O
your O
symptoms O
. O
When O
my O
MD O
got O
really O
bad O
I O
could O
still O
manage O
my O
symptoms O
by O
insuring O
my O
salt O
intake O
stayed O
very O
level O
throughout O
the O
day O
. O
Pain O
the O
ass O
You O
bet O
it O
is O
, O
but O
it O
beat O
barfing O
for O
hours O
 
The O
big O
things O
to O
avoid O
with O
GP B-DIS
is O
leafy O
and O
or O
cruciferous O
vegetables O
, O
high O
fiber O
foods O
, O
and O
high O
fat O
foods O
. O
Also O
avoid O
potato O
and O
apple O
peels O
. O
High O
fiber O
makes O
you O
bloated B-DIS
and O
high O
fat O
and O
leafy O
vegetables O
are O
hard B-DIS
to I-DIS
digest I-DIS
. O
As O
far O
as O
breakfast O
goes O
- O
eggs O
, O
toast O
, O
cereal O
, O
cheese O
, O
bacon O
or O
sausage O
drain O
from O
grease O
, O
yogurt O
, O
lots O
of O
options O
. O
Good O
luck O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
it O
is O
just O
learning O
what O
works O
with O
your O
body O
. O
 
No O
. O
But O
liquorice O
is O
a O
ways O
down O
the O
ingredients O
list O
, O
meaning O
, O
it O
s O
not O
the O
biggest O
component O
of O
the O
product O
. O
 
Niiiice O
, O
can O
t O
go O
wrong O
with O
chilaquiles O
. O
Edit O
Btw O
, O
a O
little O
google-fu O
told O
me O
that O
abdominal B-DIS
bloating I-DIS
can O
be O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
the O
Norco B-DRUG
, O
so O
there O
s O
that O
mystery O
solved O
. O
 
Fuck O
, O
this O
makes O
me O
afraid O
to O
try O
it O
. O
 
I O
think O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
feel O
that O
way O
, O
especially O
people O
who O
have O
a O
chronic O
illness O
. O
Definitely O
a O
hard O
thing O
to O
overcome O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
can O
find O
something O
that O
works O
with O
your O
limitations O
right O
now O
. O
And O
once O
you O
can O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
and O
treatment O
, O
with O
luck O
many O
more O
career O
options O
will O
be O
open O
to O
you O
. O
 
Thats O
a O
great O
idea O
actually O
, O
thanks O
 
I O
m O
being O
seen O
soon O
for O
neuropathy B-DIS
as O
my O
cardiologist O
and O
gastroenterologist O
think O
there O
s O
a O
good O
chance O
for O
it O
with O
overlapping O
symptoms O
. O
If O
you O
have O
more O
signs O
pointing O
to O
neuropathy B-DIS
than O
gastroparesis B-DIS
, O
they O
might O
want O
to O
be O
proactive O
. O
But O
this O
is O
just O
my O
experience O
, O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
about O
anyone O
else O
s O
. O
 
Not O
really O
. O
I O
ve O
not O
read O
anything O
that O
indicated O
you O
can O
cause O
your O
stones B-DIS
to O
come O
out O
any O
sooner O
. O
They O
come O
out O
based O
on O
the O
apparently O
random O
place O
they O
form O
and O
how O
your O
kidneys O
function O
. O
Just O
drink O
lots O
of O
fluids O
. O
That O
s O
about O
all O
you O
can O
do O
once O
they O
re O
formed O
. O
 
Yeah O
, O
I O
guess O
it O
s O
not O
very O
helpful O
when O
people O
just O
say O
ignore O
them O
or O
toughen O
up O
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O
Maybe O
find O
a O
support O
group O
And O
there O
s O
always O
this O
subreddit O
if O
you O
need O
someone O
to O
talk O
to O
. O
Sorry O
, O
I O
m O
not O
very O
helpful O
. O
 
gt O
; O
Seriously O
though O
, O
people O
are O
judgemental O
assholes O
sometimes O
. O
I O
hear O
you O
. O
Thankfully O
i O
ve O
not O
had O
to O
deal O
with O
any O
harassment O
like O
that O
yet O
, O
probably O
thanks O
to O
using O
a O
cane O
and O
still O
having O
gait B-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O
But O
i O
ve O
seen O
and O
experienced O
plenty O
of O
assholes O
doing O
stupid O
shit O
. O
Like O
the O
kids O
who O
park O
in O
the O
Handicap O
spots O
right O
up O
front O
because O
, O
Oh O
i O
ll O
just O
be O
a O
second O
. O
I O
wont O
matter O
. O
Or O
this O
one O
I O
saw O
just O
this O
past O
Saturday O
, O
who O
parked O
fully O
blocking O
the O
ramp O
into O
and O
out O
of O
the O
store O
... O
and O
PARKED O
THERE O
... O
with O
their O
car O
still O
running O
... O
so O
their O
passengers O
could O
go O
inside O
and O
shop O
. O
Then O
after O
20 O
minutes O
they O
got O
impatient O
and O
started O
HONKING O
and O
yelling O
out O
the O
window O
to O
hurry O
up O
Meanwhile O
people O
were O
forced O
to O
detour O
to O
another O
ramp O
down O
to O
the O
parking O
lot O
to O
get O
their O
carts O
out O
, O
and O
all O
the O
people O
with O
handicaps O
were O
stuck O
because O
this O
ASSHOLE O
couldn O
t O
be O
bothered O
to O
use O
a O
parking O
space O
like O
a O
normal O
human O
being O
. O
 
No O
, O
but O
I O
do O
now O
... O
Along O
with O
visual B-DIS
and I-DIS
audio I-DIS
hallucinations I-DIS
. O
Anti O
psychotic O
meds O
help O
. O
 
i O
honestly O
dont O
believe O
there O
is O
a O
medicine O
that O
will O
work O
once O
a O
attack O
happens O
. O
i O
take O
tablets O
that O
are O
meant O
to O
prevent O
attacks O
happen O
but O
i O
still O
have O
them O
. O
sometimes O
i O
might O
get O
a O
small O
window O
of O
time O
where O
i O
can O
feel O
it O
coming O
, O
take O
my O
pills O
and O
lie O
down O
, O
hoping O
it O
goes O
away O
. O
in O
a O
full O
blown O
attack O
i O
cant B-DIS
speak I-DIS
to I-DIS
anyone I-DIS
, O
and O
i O
have O
to O
ask O
them O
not O
to O
speak O
to O
me O
either O
which O
sounds O
wacky O
but O
for O
some O
reason O
it O
can O
make O
me O
feel O
worse O
. O
my O
sons O
19 O
and O
he O
has O
a O
deep O
voice O
and O
i O
really O
cant O
not O
have O
him O
speak O
to O
me O
.. O
some O
of O
the O
little O
things O
that O
have O
a O
big O
impact O
on O
me O
must O
sound O
ridiculous O
to O
people O
who O
dont O
understand O
what O
it O
is O
. O
until O
my B-DIS
hearing I-DIS
became I-DIS
affected I-DIS
my O
triggers O
were O
all O
either O
visual O
or O
motion O
, O
like O
reading O
or O
pc O
screens O
and O
travel O
. O
but O
now O
its O
sounds O
aswell O
. O
also O
my O
sense O
of O
smell O
is O
like O
a O
sniffer O
dogs O
sometimes O
making O
me O
feel B-DIS
so I-DIS
sick I-DIS
. O
apart O
from O
the O
effects O
during O
the O
attacks O
, O
the O
fear O
of O
having O
one O
is O
hard O
, O
especially O
when O
nobody O
seem O
to O
understand O
just O
how O
horrible O
it O
is O
not O
to O
mention O
that O
its O
not O
exactly O
curable O
and O
just O
a O
case O
of O
trial O
and O
error O
in O
medication O
. O
 
Good O
tip O
, O
thanks O
. O
 
I O
started O
with O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
had O
one O
week O
where O
I O
felt O
better O
than O
I O
had O
for O
YEARS O
, O
then O
the O
side O
effects O
began O
. O
Went O
to O
injectable O
, O
no O
better O
. O
Then O
, O
Arava B-DRUG
, O
and O
my O
hair B-DIS
began I-DIS
falling I-DIS
out I-DIS
. O
I O
went O
on O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
and O
6 O
or O
8 O
weeks O
in O
, O
I O
had O
another O
miracle O
week O
, O
but O
it O
faded O
. O
Still O
flaring B-DIS
on I-DIS
and I-DIS
off I-DIS
, O
so O
after O
another O
couple O
of O
months O
, O
Humira B-DRUG
. O
Seemed O
to O
help O
somewhat O
, O
but O
not O
enough O
according O
to O
bloodwork O
. O
And O
, O
DAMN O
that O
shot O
hurt O
and O
itched O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
on O
Actemra B-DRUG
since O
December O
, O
no O
miracle O
week O
, O
but O
no O
flares B-DIS
. O
I O
m O
SO O
grateful O
that O
these O
drugs O
have O
been O
free O
or O
5 O
at O
most O
. O
 
Yea O
I O
get O
tummy B-DIS
aches I-DIS
after O
bread O
or O
oatmeal O
It O
doesnt O
distinguish O
between O
types O
, O
but O
it O
s O
kinda O
logical O
that O
if O
u O
have O
IBS B-DIS
C I-DIS
u O
take O
something O
to O
speed O
up O
ur O
poo O
process O
, O
and O
if O
u O
have O
D O
u O
take O
something O
to O
slow O
it O
down O
no O
 
Definitely O
not O
going O
to O
quit O
exercising O
, O
but O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
do O
the O
shorter O
paths O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
encouragement O
 
I O
need O
more O
of O
these O
happy O
ending O
stories O
I O
need O
to O
know O
there O
is O
hope O
of O
feeling O
better O
in O
the O
future O
Even O
if O
anyone O
has O
links O
to O
stories O
or O
blogs O
about O
people O
who O
recovered O
from O
IBS B-DIS
... O
 
You O
could O
also O
have O
considered O
lowering O
the O
amount O
of O
NDT B-DRUG
and O
supplementing O
with O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
T4 B-DRUG
. O
The O
reason O
you O
were O
hyper B-DIS
was O
likely O
because O
of O
too O
much O
T3 B-DRUG
. O
A O
better O
way O
might O
have O
been O
to O
change O
the O
proportions O
of O
T4 B-DRUG
to O
T3 B-DRUG
rather O
than O
totally O
get O
rid O
of O
T3 B-DRUG
. O
 
I O
have O
only O
had O
about O
3 B-DIS
patches I-DIS
of I-DIS
p I-DIS
on O
my O
face O
in O
9 O
years O
of O
having O
it O
, O
and O
Vaseline B-DRUG
worked O
for O
me O
. O
It O
doesn O
t O
bloody O
work O
for O
any O
other O
part O
of O
my O
p-ridden B-DIS
body I-DIS
, O
but O
for O
my O
face O
it O
does O
. O
Go O
figure O
. O
Don O
t O
despair O
, O
you O
might O
be O
lucky O
like O
me O
and O
it O
never O
quite O
takes O
a O
hold O
on O
your O
face O
. O
Good O
luck O

Oh O
god O
nooo O
I O
don O
t O
feel O
so O
bad O
picking O
on O
spots B-DIS

once O
they O
begin O
to O
confluent O

then O
I O

The O
author O
does O
a O
good O
job O
describing O
the O
struggles O
of O
living O
with O
chronic B-DIS
illness I-DIS
with O
a O
good O
amount O
of O
humour O
too O
. O
I O
m O
definitely O
going O
to O
be O
sharing O
this O
with O
some O
of O
my O
family O
and O
friends O
. O
 
I O
take O
one O
a O
day O
, O
to O
help O
with O
inflammation B-DIS
. O
I O
ve O
ran O
out O
a O
time O
or O
two O
, O
and O
know O
that O
I O
definitely O
feel O
better O
with O
it O
. O
It O
doesn O
t O
help O
a O
*ton* O
, O
but O
any O
relief O
I O
can O
get O
, O
I O
ll O
take O
. O
 
gt O
; O
started O
taking O
Otezla B-DRUG
later O
in O
the O
morning O
, O
after O
eating O
and O
having O
my O
morning O
coffee O
and O
something O
about O
the O
caffeine O
really O
seemed O
to O
reduce O
the O
nausea B-DIS
and O
headache B-DIS
for O
me O
. O
I O
ll O
try O
what O
you O
ve O
suggested O
. O
I O
usually O
take O
the O
pills O
WITH O
my O
morning O
meal O
so O
it O
s O
worth O
the O
shot O
wait O
1 O
hour O
. O
I O
might O
even O
consider O
on O
going O
down O
to O
only O
a O
single O
nightly O
dose O
after O
3-4 O
months O
if O
it O
works O
. O
 
What O
a O
wonderful O
thing O
to O
hear O
It O
is O
so O
encouraging O
that O
people O
are O
benefiting O
from O
something O
like O
this O
My O
best O
to O
your O
mother O
Thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
 
I O
tried O
cpap B-DRUG
and O
ditched O
it O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
on O
this O
subreddit O
think O
that O
cpap O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
go O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
would O
have O
known O
about O
the O
other O
options O
earlier O
but O
oh O
well O
. O
You O
should O
try O
and O
figure O
out O
the O
root O
cause O
of O
your O
apnea B-DIS
, O
for O
example O
do O
you O
a O
stuffy B-DIS
nose I-DIS
or O
when O
you O
breathe O
in O
does O
your O
nostrils B-DIS
close I-DIS
. O
What O
helped O
me O
was O
using O
a O
nasal B-DRUG
dialator I-DRUG
it O
is O
like O
10 O
bucks O
and O
you O
stick O
it O
in O
your O
nose O
, O
cleaning O
, O
dusting O
, O
allergy B-DRUG
pills I-DRUG
and O
shots O
can O
help O
with O
stuffyness B-DIS
. O
There O
are O
also O
surgeries O
to O
help O
remove O
your O
sinus O
, O
open O
the O
throat O
, O
widen O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
nose O
, O
etc O
. O
if O
your O
throat O
feels O
like O
it O
closes O
more O
when O
you O
lay O
down O
, O
then O
proving O
yourself O
up O
at O
a O
45 O
degree O
and O
can O
help O
and O
don O
t O
sleep O
on O
your O
back O
. O
Ideally O
you O
would O
sleep O
on O
a O
massage O
or O
chiropractor O
s O
table O
and O
lay O
face O
down O
and O
have O
the O
table O
at O
a O
slight O
angle O
with O
your O
head O
about O
25 O
degrees O
above O
your O
body O
. O
But O
yeah O
just O
figure O
out O
the O
cause O
and O
think O
of O
ways O
to O
fix O
the O
root O
. O
 
gt O
; O
My O
jaw O
falls O
open O
when O
I O
go O
to O
bed O
and O
air B-DIS
leaks I-DIS
out I-DIS
. O
Is O
it O
better O
to O
use O
a O
chinstrap O
to O
keep O
my O
mouth O
closed O
or O
get O
a O
full O
face O
mask O
I O
use O
both O
. O
My O
mouth B-DIS
flops I-DIS
open I-DIS
too O
far O
to O
use O
the O
FFM O
without O
a O
chin O
strap O
. O
 
Have O
you O
tried O
a O
full O
nose O
mouth O
mask O
That O
is O
what O
I O
use O
because O
the O
nasal O
style O
just O
didn O
t O
work O
for O
me O
. O
 
Watch O
my O
really O
long O
video O
about O
how O
to O
buy O
my O
shit O
. O
 
i O
recently O
had O
my O
3rd O
round O
of O
steroids B-DRUG
and O
have O
not O
had O
the O
relief O
I O
had O
4 O
years O
ago O
. O
They O
said O
they O
font O
want O
to O
do O
too O
much O
more O
. O
The O
initial O
shots O
i O
had O
gotten O
actually O
had O
kicked O
cataracts B-DIS
into O

gear O
as O
well O
and O
trust O
me O
it O
sucked O
at O
age O
40 O
having O
to O
get O
surgery O
. O
Since O
there O
has O
been O
no O
impact O
this O
round O
the O
ENT O
does O
not O
want O
to O
keep O
pushing O
it O
and O
we O
will O
be O
talking O
to O
a O
neurologist O
in O
September O
about O
what O
we O
might O
be O
able O
to O
do O
short O
of O
surgery O
. O
 
Sadly O
I O
live O
in O
a O
state O
that O
will O
be O
one O
of O
the O
last O
, O
if O
not O
the O
last O
, O
to O
legalize O
anything O
like O
that O
. O
Or O
I O
would O
definitely O
be O
looking O
into O
that O
more O
. O
 
I O
actually O
found O
a O
physio O
that O
is O
also O
a O
trainer O
, O
workout O
changes O
based O
on O
what O
my O
RA O
is O
doing O
. O
Ranges O
from O
stretching O
range O
of O
motion O
to O
lifting O
slow O
progression O
, O
stay O
with O
comfortable O
and O
don O
t O
push O
limits O
. O
Cardio O
is O
usually O
bike O
stationary O
in O
bad O
weather O
because O
chlorine O
triggers O
my O
asthma O
and O
my O
feet O
are O
pretty O
well O
fucked O
so O
excessive O
walking O
is O
out O
. O
 
I O
live O
in O
Houston O
, O
where O
the O
public O
metro O
system O
sucks O
ass O
. O
 
They O
are O
completely O
different O
drugs O
, O
so O
definitely O
give O
Humira B-DRUG
a O
try O
. O
And O
if O
Humira B-DRUG
doesn O
t O
written O
there O
are O
other O
drugs O
to O
try O
, O
don O
t O
be O
discouraged O
You O
are O
definitely O
allergic O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
, O
from O
the O
sound O
of O
your O
symptoms O
. O
But O
the O
hair B-DIS
loss I-DIS
might O
be O
due O
to O
mtx B-DRUG
if O
you O
are O
on O
that O
also O
, O
I O
don O
t O
recall O
seeing O
information O
about O
Enbrel B-DRUG
causing O
that O
symptom O
. O
If O
you O
are O
on O
mtx B-DRUG
also O
, O
be O
sure O
to O
take O
your O
folic B-DRUG
acid I-DRUG
like O
prescribed O
and O
maybe O
think O
about O
adding O
a O
biotin B-DRUG
vitamin I-DRUG
to O
your O
regime O
, O
it O
will O
help O
with O
hair B-DIS
loss I-DIS
. O
 
With O
that O
many O
central O
events O
you O
should O
definitely O
talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
. O
You O
may O
need O
a O
Bi-PAP O
or O
ASV O
depending O
on O
what O
is O
going O
on O
. O
 
I O
love O
my O
fingerless O
compression O
gloves O
. O
They O
help O
me O
immensely O
. O
I O
wear O
compression O
socks O
under O
my O
regular O
socks O
as O
well O
. O
I O
also O
use O
my O
paraffin O
bath O
frequently O
on O
my O
hands O
, O
feet O
, O
and O
elbows O
. O
I O
always O
have O
a O
heating O
pad O
and O
heated O
blankets O
on O
hand O
. O
My O
hubby O
even O
ordered O
travel O
heated O
blankets O
that O
connect O
to O
the O
car O
. O
USB O
cigarette O
lighter O
. O
Same O
with O
hand O
warmers O
. O
I O
have O
the O
reusable O
ones O
that O
I O
boil O
, O
no O
microwave O
needed O
as O
well O
as O
disposable O
that O
I O
keep O
in O
the O
glove O
compartments O
. O
For O
years O
I O
did O
the O
best O
inserts O
with O
cheap O
shoes O
route O
as O
well O
however O
I O
noticed O
a O
big O
improvement O
when O
I O
broke O
down O
and O
purchased O
high O
quality O
shoes O
. O
Hope O
this O
helps O
. O
PM O
me O
if O
you O
have O
any O
other O
questions O
. O
I O
will O
gladly O
share O
all O
my O
tips O
and O
tricks O
. O
 
My O
dermatologist O
mentioned O
something O
about O
prolonged O
use O
of O
salicylic B-DRUG
acid I-DRUG
shampoos I-DRUG
having O
negative O
effects O
, O
but O
did O
not O
elaborate O
. O
The O
salicylic B-DRUG
acid I-DRUG
doesn O
t O
treat O
the O
psoriasis B-DIS
, O
though O
, O
it O
merely O
helps O
dissolve O
the O
buildup O
of O
skin O
. O
It O
might O
be O
worth O
talking O
to O
a O
doctor O
if O
you O
keep O
needing O
it O
. O
 
Happy O
to O
hear O
that O
About O
how O
long O
do O
they O
last O
 
You O
should O
know O
if O
you O
have O
a O
string O
hanging O
out O
of O
your O

Did O
you O
just O
get O
the O
surgery O
 
That O
s O
interesting O
. O
My O
wife O
has O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
gi B-DIS
problems I-DIS
. O
Gallbladder B-DIS
removed I-DIS
, O
had O
gastric B-DIS
bypass I-DIS
. O
At O
one O
point O
something O
with O
her O
pancreas O
. O
Possibly O
liver O
at O
one O
point O
, O
but O
appears O
to O
have O
healed O
itself O
. O
But O
she O
has O
ra B-DIS
now O
. O
I O
wonder O
if O
whatever O
was O
causing O
the O
problems O
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O
I O
know O
the O
bypass O
wouldn O
t O
have O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
it O
by O
itself O
but O
maybe O
it O
helped O
set O
off O
whatever O
else O
was O
going O
on O
. O
 
Funny O
when O
you O
run O
into O
similar O
recipes O
as O
coincidence O
. O
I O
take O
tea O
with O
turmeric O
, O
lemon O
and O
coconut O
oil O
every O
morning O
. O
For O
general O
health O
reasons O
, O
not O
specifically O
for O
my O
Parkinson O
s. O
The O
coconut O
oil O
is O
to O
help O
with O
regularity B-DIS
issues I-DIS
due O
to O
Parkinson O
s O
. O
 
I O
was O
switched O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
after O
being O
10 O
years O
or O
so O
on O
MTX B-DRUG
. O
While O
I O
was O
taking O
MTX B-DRUG
, O
my O
ALT B-DIS
AST B-DIS
levels I-DIS
were I-DIS
almost I-DIS
always I-DIS
elevated I-DIS
. O
Since O
I O
switched O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
in O
August O
, O
they O
got O
back O
to O
normal O
, O
and O
haven O
t O
risen O
since O
. O
It O
s O
there O
a O
chance O
you O
ve O
taken O
other O
meds O
that O
are O
heavy O
on O
the O
liver O
Antibiotics B-DRUG
perhaps O
They O
can O
also O
elevate O
AST B-DIS
levels O
. O
 
Thanks O
for O
replying O
. O
Can O
you O
list O
what O
other O
vital O
information O
a O
sleep O
study O
gives O
over O
a O
pulse O
oximeter O
I O
thought O
the O
main O
diagnosis O
for O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
was O
a O
stop B-DIS
in I-DIS
breathing I-DIS
or O
shallow B-DIS
breathing I-DIS
Wouldn O
t O
lowered B-DIS
oxygen I-DIS
levels I-DIS
be O
key O
 
clear O
airway O
is O
a O
term O
*made O
up* O
by O
philips O
respironics O
instead O
of O
the O
industry O
standard O
central O
apnea B-DIS
. O
why O
who O
knows O
. O
 
This O
is O
the O
right O
answer O
. O
Your O
DME O
will O
test O
your O
equipment O
with O
a O
manometer O
for O
free O
. O
Mine O
has O
walk-in O
hours O
for O
just O
this O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O
They O
plug O
in O
your O
CPAP O
and O
it O
will O
show O
the O
actual O
delivered O
pressure O
. O
It O
s O
done O
in O
2 O
minutes O
. O
Otherwise O
, O
you O
can O
buy O
a O
good O
manometer O
for O
around O
75 O
or O
build O
one O
for O
5 O
 
Daft O
question O
. O
How O
do O
the O
compression O
socks O
and O
cloves O
help O
Is O
the O
idea O
that O
they O
provide O
firm O
pressure O
all O
over O
and O
somehow O
limit O
, O
or O
spread O
out O
the O
inflammation B-DIS
My O
current O
flare B-DIS
no O
under O
control O
had O
enough O
ankle B-DIS
inflammation I-DIS
there O
was O
no O
bone O
definition O
to O
be O
seen O
as O
the O
ankles B-DIS
were I-DIS
too I-DIS
puffy I-DIS
... O
would O
they O
help O
reduce O
inflammation B-DIS
, O
or O
reduce O
pain B-DIS
Cheers O
 
I O
ve O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
RA B-DIS
since O
I O
was O
18 O
months O

very O
happy O

a O
great O
life O

My O
rheumatologist O
calls O
me O
a O
veteran O
. O
So O
I O
ve O
had O
over O
21 O
years O
with O
it O
. O
It O
s O
severe B-DIS
RA I-DIS
in O
every O
joint O
besides O
my O
pinky O
finger O
on O
my O
right O
hand O
. O
Neck O
, O
jaw O
, O
etc O
. O
I O
have O
7 B-DIS
other I-DIS
chronic I-DIS
pain I-DIS
conditions I-DIS
too O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
told O
I O
always O
smile O
and O
don O
t O
complain O
about O
it O
, O
but O
it O
really O
doesn O
t O
take O
much O
if O
you O
try O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
positives O
. O
You O
ll O
always O
have O
bad O
days O
, O
but O
it O
s O
about O
your O
perspective O
on O
life O
. O
Stay O
strong O
and O
keep O
fighting O
 
No O
, O
GFCI O
and O
AFCI O
are O
different O
things O
. O
Ground O
fault O
detection O
uses O
a O
loop O
coil O
to O
look O
for O
imbalanced O
current O
flow O
5ma O
between O
the O
hot O
and O
neutral O
wire O
. O
This O
looks O
for O
current O
flowing O
through O
something O
besides O
the O
wires O
commonly O
a O
person O
who O
contacted O
a O
live O
wire O
and O
prevents O
electrocution O
hazards O
. O
AFCI O
has O
a O
microprocessor O
that O
monitors O
the O
current O
for O
spikes O
indicating O
that O
there O
is O
an O
arc O
. O
Arcs O
are O
a O
fire O
hazard O
. O
Most O
AFCI O
also O
have O
Ground O
Fault O
detection O
, O
but O
it O
s O
in O
the O
50ma O
range O
, O
10x O
the O
GFCI O
level O
. O
GFCI O
are O
code O
for O
bathrooms O
, O
kitchens O
, O
and O
spaces O
with O
concrete O
floors O
IE O
around O
water O
. O
AFCI O
are O
code O
for O
Living O
areas O
such O
as O
living O
rooms O
, O
Bedrooms O
, O
kitchens O
, O
dining O
rooms O
, O
etc O
. O
AFCIs O
are O
much O
newer O
than O
GFCIs O
so O
only O
homes O
remodels O
after O
about O
2014 O
in O
the O
USA O
2015 O
in O
Canada O
require O
them O
. O
If O
you O
go O
to O
the O
big O
box O
stores O
it O
s O
actually O
hard O
to O
find O
AFCI O
breakers O
even O
though O
you O
shouldn O
t O
be O
installing O
an O
old-school O
breaker O
almost O
anywhere O
anymore O
Most O
spaces O
will O
require O
either O
a O
GFCI O
, O
an O
AFCI O
, O
or O
a O
combination O
breaker O
with O
both O
GFCI O
amp O
; O
AFCI O
such O
as O
bathrooms O
and O
kitchens O
. O
This O
greatly O
adds O
to O
the O
cost O
of O
an O
electrical O
rework O
A O
standard O
breaker O
can O
be O
gotten O
in O
the O
6 O
range O
depending O
on O
the O
panel O
brand O
. O
A O
GFCI O
breaker O
will O
35-50 O
. O
An O
AFCI O
will O
be O
30-50 O
as O
well O
. O
A O
dual O
breaker O
will O
be O
50 O
if O
you O
can O
find O
one O
that O
fits O
your O
panel O
. O
 
Paid O
30 O
for O
a O
250ml O
bottle O
, O
used O
more O
than O
half O
of O
it O
with O
zero O
results O
. O
Maybe O
varies O
from O
person O
to O
person O
but O
didn O
t O
work O
for O
me O
 
If O
you O
ve O
been O
stressed B-DIS
the O
last O
4-8 O
weeks O
, O
more O
than O
usual O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
d O
probably O
blame O
that O
. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
comorbidity B-DIS
that O
means O
you O
heal O
slower O
that O
doesn O
t O
help O
. O
If O
it O
makes O
you O
feel O
any O
better O
, O
I O
ve O
periodically O
done O
it O
while O
sleeping O
, O
like O
in O
a O
dream O
. O
I O
ll O
wake O
up O
IMMEDIATELY O
with O
SCREAMING B-DIS
HOT I-DIS
WHITE I-DIS
PAIN I-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
face I-DIS
. O
Last O
time O
I O
drew O
blood O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
the O
reason O
is O
bodies O
are O
weird O
. O
and O
ours O
are O
weirder O
 
Thanks O
I O
will O
let O
him O
know O
He O
s O
taking O
that O
medication O
as O
well O
as O
selegiline B-DRUG
. O
I O
ll O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
details O
mentioned O
. O
 
Thanks O
so O
much O
 
It O
can O
and O
does O
. O
However O
I O
suspect O
it O
is O
likely O
you O
have O
Ankylosing B-DIS
Spondylitis I-DIS
. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
A.S. B-DIS
in O
1972 O
and O
R.A. B-DIS
in O
1975 O
. O
Adding B-DIS
Neuropathy O
to O
the O
list O
in O
2012 O
. O
The O
A.S. O
has O
caused O
far O
more O
permanent B-DIS
damage I-DIS
and O
pain B-DIS
than O
the O
others O
. O
Since B-DIS
1972 O
I O
ve O
lost O
5 O
in O
height O
. O
The O
neuropathy B-DIS
came O
courtesy O
of O
Lyme O
s O
Disease O
. O
Where O
the O
discs B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
spine I-DIS
and I-DIS
neck I-DIS
have I-DIS
ossified I-DIS
and O
developed O
bone B-DIS
spurs I-DIS
they O
put O
pressure B-DIS
on I-DIS
nerves I-DIS
and I-DIS
my I-DIS
carotid I-DIS
artery I-DIS
. O
I O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
muscle B-DIS
and I-DIS
vasospasms I-DIS
. O
I O
can O
t O
take O
NSAIDs O
and O
pain O
meds O
do O
not O
have O
any O
effect O
on O
me O

never O

It O
s O
a O
weird O

I O
think O
in O
past O
generations O
somebody O
pissed O
in O
the O
family O
gene O

Web O
MD O
and O
similar O
medical O
apps O
will O
not O
provide O
you O
with O
the O

you O

You O
need O
a O
live O
exam O
by O
a O

likely O
an O

you O

Mindfulness O
in O

5-15 O
minutes O
once O
a O
day O
probably O
isn O

most O
useful O

No O

it O

just O
quicker O

I O

I O

you O

I O
work O

When O

ve O
also O
provided O
doctors O
notes O
to O
upper-management O
and O
HR O
. O
We O
didn O
t O
choose O
to O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
these O
horrible O
symptoms O
and O
unfortunately O
, O
there O
isn O
t O
much O
we O
can O
do O
about O
it O
. O
Thing O
is O
, O
as O
long O
as O
your O
bosses O
are O
aware O
of O
it O
and O
you O
ve O
provided O
proof O
like O
a O
doctors O
note O
, O
then O
you O
shouldn O
t O
have O
to O
worry O
. O
Now O
that O
you O
mention O
it O
, O
in O
an O
office O
with O
250 O
people O
, O
I O
m O
willing O
to O
bet O
you O
re O
not O
the O
only O
person O
there O
suffering O
from O
IBS B-DIS
as O
it O
has O
been O
diagnosed O
more O
commonly O
as O
of O
late O
well O
, O
at O
least O
my O
doctor O
says O
so O
. O
 
I O
does O
not O
seem O
to O
have O
any O
side O
effects O
and O
it O
will O
help O
with O
constipation B-DIS
in O
any O
case O
. O
Its O
also O
quite O
cheap O
. O
 
I O
used O
to O
do O
baths O
with O
dead O
sea O
salt O
and O
then O
I O
would O
put O
maybe O
5-10 O
drops O
of O
tea O
tree O
oil O
into O
the O
water O
. O
Now O
though O
thanks O
to O
finding O
some O
meds O
that O
work O
I O
usually O
just O
stick O
with O
products O
that O
contain O
tea O
tree O
oil O
, O
soaps O
, O
shampoos O
, O
etc O
. O
I O
make O
sure O
to O
read O
the O
ingredients O
to O
make O
sure O
it O
really O
has O
the O
stuff O
in O
there O
you O
can O
usually O
tell O
by O
the O
smell O
 
I O
take O
Xanax B-DRUG
and O
lexapro B-DRUG
for O
anxiety B-DIS
and O
depression B-DIS
issues O
. O
The O
whole O
time O
I O
m O
getting O
wired O
up O
for O
the O
sleep O
study O
, O
the O
sleep O
technician O
is O
telling O
me O
that O
I O
need O
to O
get O
off O
that O
medication O
cause O
it O
effects O
my O
R.E.M O
. O
Sleep O
. O
I O
got O
diagnosed O
with O
moderate B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
, O
and O
you O
know O
what O
happened O
with O
my O
meds O
Nothing O
, O
cause O
the O
meds O
helped O
me O
more O
than O
anything O
. O
Unless O
your O
doctor O
says O
you O
can O
t O
take O
them O
, O
I O
wouldn O
t O
worry O
. O
 
My O

Breast B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
depends O
on O
whether O
it O
s O
in O
the O
early O
stage O
, O
in O
the O
middle O
stage O
, O
or O
in O
the O
late O
stage O
. O
For O
the O
earlier O
stage O
, O
there O
is O
the O
way O
to O
inhibit O
and O
kill O
cancer B-DIS
cells O
. O
For O
the O
middle O
stage O
, O
there O
the O
way O
to O
inhibit O
the O
breast B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
growth O
and O
prevent O
the O
cancer O
cell O
spread O
. O
For O
the O
late O
stage O
, O
we O
can O
only O
control O
the O
pain B-DIS
. O
 
I O
m O
fairly O
new O
to O
cycling O
but O
I O
love O
it O
It O
actually O
allows O
me O
to O
stop O
thinking O
about O
my O
bladder O
while O
I O
ride O
, O
I O
think O
the O
pressure O
of O
the O
saddle O
is O
just O
right O
that O
it O
masks O
the O
irritated B-DIS
feeling I-DIS
, O
I O
guess O
the O
endorphin B-DIS
rush I-DIS
helps O
too O
. O
I O
ve O
not O
noticed O
an O
increase O
in O
symptoms O
after O
cycling O
but O
I O
ve O
not O
gone O
for O
more O
than O
a O
couple O
hours O
. O
Do O
you O
still O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
symptoms O
with O
the O
diet O
or O
has O
it O
almost O
eliminated O
them O
Thinking O
I O
m O
gon O
na O
need O
to O
man O
up O
and O
properly O
be O
strict O
with O
the O
diet O
It O
s O
really O
encouraging O
for O
me O
to O
know O
others O
are O
pushing O
themselves O
too O
I O
did O
a O
half O
marathon O
last O
year O
and O
was O
hoping O
to O
do O
a O
full O
one O
this O
year O
but O
that O
will O
have O
to O
sit O
on O
the O
back O
burner O
for O
a O
while O
. O
I O
m O
going O
to O
try O
oxybutycin B-DRUG
again O
just O
in O
case O
it O
was O
a O
coincidence O
the O
weird O
flare B-DIS
while O
taking O
it O
, O
symptoms O
vary O
so O
much O
all O
the O
time O
it O
s O
so O
hard O
to O
tell O
what O
s O
caused O
what O
 
I O
have O
the O
same O
thing O
with O
my O
rabbits O
and O
have O
never O
had O
a O
flare B-DIS
because O
of O
them O
. O
I O
do O
have O
the O
whole O
runny B-DIS
nose I-DIS
and O
asthma B-DIS
coughing I-DIS
nonsense O
after O
cuddling O
them O
though O
. O
 
Well O
this O
sub O
reddit O
is O
here O
for O
discussion O
and O
I O
didn O
t O
ask O
for O
a O
diagnosis.. O
Obviously O
you O
don O
t O
know O
. O
Just O
advice O
on O
what O
to O
do O
. O
 
gt O
; O
You O
re O
so O
lucky O
. O
I O
had O
to O
pay O
1,250 O
for O
my O
sleep O
study O
the O
other O
night O
and O
also O
had O
to O
return O
my O
cpap O
machine O
because O
my O
insurance O
didn O
t O
cover O
it O
because O
of O
a O
high O
deductible O
. O
I O
still O
don O
t O
know O
and O
can O
t O
figure O
out O
why O
I O
m O
getting O
the O
worst B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
after O
falling O
asleep O
for O
5-6 O
hours O
I O
wake B-DIS
up I-DIS
feeling I-DIS
so I-DIS
horrible I-DIS
. O
The O
mask O
was O
on O
and O
off O
for O
me O
but O
I O
m O
afraid O
not O
having O
it O
is O
bad O
but O
I O
don O
t O
know O
what O
to O
do O
since O
I O
don O
t O
have O
the O
money O
now O
... O
FWIW O
, O
a O
new O
auto O
machine O
that O
treats O
OSA B-DIS
is O
about O
500 O
online O
. O
 
A O
nurse O
friend O
of O
mine O
told O
me O
to O
go O
to O
the O
ER O
and O
not O
leave O
until O
they O
called O
a O
urologist O
. O
I O
live O
in O
Toronto O
, O
so O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
if O
where O
you O
live O
has O
the O
same O
facilities O
available O
. O
 
I O
wasn O
t O
certain O
if O
I O
should O
do O
the O
survey O
, O
because O
I O
was O
only O
an O
occasional O
, O
secondary O
, O
remote O
, O
caregiver O
until O
six O
months O
ago O
. O
 
Yes O
, O
you O
can O
select O
COBRA O
retroactively O
. O
But O
that O
means O
the O
visit O
to O
the O
doctor O
will O
be O
out O
of O
pocket O
. O
 
Everyone O
else O
seems O
to O
have O
covered O
the O
other O
bases O
, O
but O
I O
just O
want O
to O
emphasize O
one O
point O
Follow O
the O
dosing O
tapering O
guidelines O
your O
doctor O
gave O
you O
. O
It O
s O
fantastic O
overall O
for O
relief O
, O
but O
suddenly O
deciding O
to O
stop O
taking O
it O
when O
you O
re O
on O
a O
40mg O
dose O
because O
you O
don O
t O
like O
some O
of O
the O
side O
effects O
can O
cause O
some O
serious O
problems O
. O
 
Yea O
, O
I O
ve O
read O
conflicting O
things O
on O
that O
. O
Some O
say O
to O
take O
with O
food O
and O
somewhere O
I O
read O
it O
said O
that O
it O
may O
be O
best O
to O
take O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
. O
Kinda O
why O
I O
asked O
here O
. O
I O
would O
rather O
ask O
my O
fellow O
crohnies O
. O
Thank O
you O
 
I O
woke O
up O
on O
4th O
of O
July O
, O
age O
29 O
, O
and O
started O
vomiting B-DIS
. O
Haven O
t O
stopped O
in O
6 O
years O
. O
Also O
diagnosed O
as O
post-viral B-DIS
idiopathic B-DIS
but O
there O
is O
some O
new O
family O
history O
that O
may O
mean O
it O
is O
mitochondrial B-DIS
related O
. O
 
I O
ve O
never O
heard O
of O
fresubin B-DRUG
, O
it O
actually O
looks O
pretty O
good O
, O
definitely O
making O
a O
note O
of O
it O
in O
case O
I O
suddenly O
start O
getting O
worse O
. O
How O
much O
have O
you O
experimented O
with O
diet O
I O
found O
a O
vegan O
diet O
effectively O
cutting O
out O
fat O
and O
dairy O
helped O
me O
a O
huge O
amount O
, O
although O
this O
was O
when O
I O
was O
past O
the O
worst O
of O
it O
. O
Yeah O
I O
know O
exactly O
what O
you O
mean O
, O
I O
completely O
lost O
the O
will O
to O
do O
anything O
at O
all O
, O
and O
my O
mental B-DIS
health I-DIS
massively I-DIS
deteriorated I-DIS
which O
is O
terrible O
for O
stomach B-DIS
gut B-DIS
problems I-DIS
and O
made O
the O
whole O
situation O
worse O
. O
If O
your O
open O
to O
it O
I O
would O
definitely O
recommend O
asking O
your O
GP O
to O
refer O
you O
to O
some O
sort O
of O
mental O
health O
support O
, O
even O
if O
you O
re O
not O
depressed B-DIS
having O
someone O
removed O
from O
the O
situation O
to O
support O
you O
helps O
a O
lot O
. O
I O
can O
t O
imagine O
how O
hard O
it O
is O
to O
go O
through O
it O
all O
while O
living O
alone O
. O
I O
would O
honestly O
contact O
your O
gastro O
team O
and O
really O
try O
get O
through O
to O
them O
the O
situation O
you O
re O
in O
. O
Especially O
living O
alone O
while O
ill O
and O
I O
suspect O
malnourished B-DIS
, O
it O
s O
dangerous O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
. O
If O
all O
else O
fails O
and O
you O
feel O
you O
can O
t O
cope O
just O
present O
yourself O
to O
A O
amp O
; O
E. O
You O
ll O
at O
least O
get O
to O
see O
someone O
in O
the O
gastro O
team O
if O
you O
go O
on O
a O
week O
day O
and O
they O
may O
be O
able O
to O
help O
you O
out O
. O
 
Thank O
you O
. O
I O
feel O
really O
ignorant O
compared O
to O
everyone O
else O
about O
my O
own O
condition O
which O
feels O
a O
bit O
embarrassing O
. O
I O
ll O
ask O
some O
more O
questions O
. O
 
Make O
sure O
to O
stay O
home O
while O
taking O
it O
. O
Plan O
to O
not O
leave O
the O
house O
 
Thank O
you O
-- O
It O
has O
come O
to O
the O
point O
where O
we O
are O
letting O
it O
be O
, O
but O
she O
would O
see B-DIS
hear B-DIS
things I-DIS
like O
little O
kids O
hiding O
under O
her O
bed O
or O
that O
there O
s O
a O
crying O
baby O
. O
Just O
a O
minute O
ago O
, O
she O
came O
running O
out O
of O
her O
room O
telling O
us O
to O
kick O
out O
the O
kids O
in O
her O
bathroom O
because O
they O
re O
smoking O
cigarettes O
Like O
what O
would O
be O
the O
best O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
these O
types O
of O
situations O
She O
won O
t O
sleep O
and O
she O
would O
get O
distracted O
by O
her O
images O
if O
we O
are O
trying O
to O
hold O
a O
conversation O
with O
her O
. O
Yes O
, O
it O
is O
true O
. O
My O
mom O
has O
9 O
siblings O
that O
are O
alive O
right O
now O
and O
she O
is O
the O
second O
youngest O
. O
I O
understand O
that O
it O
s O
really O
hard O
for O
her O
because O
she O
has O
so O
much O
responsibility O
. O
Half O
my O
uncles O
, O
aunts O
and O
almost O
all O
my O
cousins O
rarely O
come O
to O
visit O
my O
grandma O
and O
they O
live O
like O
10-30 O
minutes O
away O
. O
Some O
even O
blame O
my O
mom O
for O
driving O
my O
grandpa O
to O
his O
death O
even O
though O
she O
s O
the O
one O
that O
puts O
food O
on O
the O
table O
for O
them O
and O
does O
the O
daily O
chores O
. O
So O
yeah O
, O
she O
s O
definitely O
stressed B-DIS
out I-DIS
. O
I O
will O
for O
sure O
try O
to O
show O
her O
some O
research O
about O
it O
. O
I O
don O
t O
think O
she O
would O
like O
the O
idea O
of O
support O
groups O
. O
It O
will O
more O
than O
likely O
make O
her O
feel O
underappreciated O
... O
Sorry O
for O
the O
little O
therapy O
rant O
haha O
, O
it O
s O
just O
upsetting O
to O
see O
my O
mom O
and O
grandma O
like O
this O
Your O
explanation O
of O
the O
symptoms O
coming O
in O
waves O
like O
happiness O
and O
sadness O
was O
great O
, O
I O
think O
I O
understand O
it O
a O
lot O
more O
now O
. O
Today O
is O
day O
2 O
of O
it O
starting O
up O
again O
, O
so O
we O
ll O
see O
 
if O
it O
s O
worse O
than O
the O
last O
time O
. O
She O
will O
also O
be O
seeing O
her O
doctor O
tomorrow O
morning O
. O
Although O
, O
I O
don O
t O
think O
much O
would O
come O
out O
of O
the O
doctor O
s O
visit O
regarding O
her O
dementia B-DIS
since O
she O
goes O
in O
regularly O
for O
various O
other O
problems O
like O
cardiovascular B-DIS
conditions I-DIS
and O
diabetes B-DIS
. O
Thank O
you O
, O
again O
Your O
reply O
did O
make O
sense O
. O
 
I O
feel O
ya O
man O
. O
I O
don O
t O
like O
people O
, O
but O
not O
liking O
people O
is O
why O
I O
m O
lonely B-DIS
. O
Being O
lonely B-DIS
makes O
me O
not O
like O
myself O
. O
It O
s O
a O
vicious O
cycle O
. O
I O
struggle O
to O
rectify O
things O
other O
people O
say O
and O
do O
in O
my O
own O
head O
, O
and O
I O
end O
up O
wanting O
to O
distance O
myself O
. O
I O
know O
it O
s O
a O
problem O
with O
me O
and O
not O
with O
other O
people O
, O
but O
I O
don O
t O
want O
to O
compromise O
who O
I O
am O
to O
have O
friends O
. O
I O
know O
that O
I O
d O
be O
even O
more O
lonely O
and O
I O
d O
feel O
even O
more O
isolated B-DIS
if O
I O
faked O
who O
I O
was O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
others O
. O
I O
m O
24 O
, O
and O
I O
ve O
felt O
this O
way O
since O
I O
went O
to O
jail O
when O
I O
was O
20 O
for O
a O
bit O
of O
an O
extended O
stay O
for O
weed B-DRUG
. O
I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
m O
a O
person O
I O
d O
want O
to O
be O
friends O
with O
, O
even O
. O
I O
know O
I O
could O
fake O
it O
like O
I O
did O
from O
17-20 O
and O
have O
a O
ton O
of O
friends O
. O
I O
almost O
took O
my O
own O
life O
back O
then O
, O
though O
, O
because O
the O
constant O
weight O
of O
knowing O
I O
had O
to O
pretend O
to O
be O
someone O
else O
to O
have O
a O
social O
life O
. O
I O
can O
smoke O
weed O
and O
not O
care O
, O
and O
just O
play O
video O
games O
in O
all O
my O
free O
time O
. O
I O
don O
t O
want O
to O
live O
in O
a O
haze B-DIS
anymore O
, O
though O
. O
I O
surrendered O
my O
medical O
card O
back O
to O
the O
state O
. O
It O
s O
been O
a O
week O
and O
the O
loneliness O
is O
starting O
to O
hit O
. O
We O
re O
in O
similar O
boats O
. O
It O
s O
shit O
. O
If O
you O
find O
a O
solution O
, O
please O
, O
let O
me O
know O
. O
I O
went O
to O
Buffalo O
wild O

Feels O

Hey O

shit O
happens O
and O
when O
bdp B-DIS
kicks O
you O
keep O
doing O
mistakes O
over O
and O
over O
again O
. O
But O
thst O
is O
the O
moment O
you O
should O
take O
a O
step O
back O
and O
try O
to O
be O
consious O
. O
If O
you O
can O
get O
some O
me O
days O
or O
weeks O
even O
better O
. O
Take O
them O
, O
try O
to O
keep O
your O
mind O
fron O
old O
stuff O
and O
start O
fresh O
. O
If O
not O
jist O
keep O
going O
, O
things O
will O
be O
better O
in O
the O
end O
. O
And O
do O
not O
forget O
; O
the O
best O
part O
of O
hitting O
the O
rock O
bottom O
, O
you O
will O
be O
rising O
after O
. O
Even O
it O
is O
uphill O
you O
will O
. O
Just O
keep O
going O
. O
 
Thank O
you O
. O
I O
really O
hope O
he O
does O
recover O
. O
I O
ve O
known O
all O
my O
life O
that O
horrible O
things O
can O
happen O
to O
good O
people O
. O
Obviously O
. O
But O
it O
was O
always O
sort O
of O
abstract O
, O
I O
ve O
never O
experienced O
it O
this O
directly O
before O
. O
I O
feel B-DIS
helpless I-DIS
, O
but O
your O
advice O
on O
pacing O
is O
amazing O
- O
I O
ve O
never O
considered O
that O
before O
, O
but O
it O
s O
definitely O
true O
. O
 
I O
ve O
had O
minor B-DIS
stomach I-DIS
issues I-DIS
my O
whole O
life O
. O
Nothing O
ever O
that O
bad O
, O
nothing O
the O
normal O
person O
wouldn O
t O
get O
. O
One O
morning O
I O
woke O
up O
with O
horrid B-DIS
nausea I-DIS
. O
As O
the O
nausea B-DIS
disappeared O
I O
felt O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
abdomen I-DIS
. O
They O
thought O
it O
was O
gallstones B-DIS
at O
first O
but O
after O
a O
bunch O
of O
tests O
they O
said O
it O
was O
GP B-DIS
. O
So O
basically O
I O
went O
from O
0 O
to O
GP B-DIS
with O
celiac B-DIS
disease I-DIS
overnight O
 
I O
understood O
it O
as O
a O
roaming O
power O
outage O
. O
Block O
A O
goes O
dark O
for O
12 O
hours O
, O
block O
B O
is O
flickering O
lights O
, O
block O
C O
is O
dim O
, O
but O
block O
D O
and O
E O
have O
plenty O
of O
power O
to O
get O
on O
with O
their O
days O
. O
Then O
in O
12 O
hours O
it O
switches O
so O
block O
B O
goes O
dark O
and O
block O
e O
a O
have O
power O
But O
now O
A O
has O
to O
recover O
from O
the O
decreased O
productivity O
and O
anything O
that O
went O
wrong O
while O
the O
lights O
were O
out O
. O
which O
is O
why O
your O
body O
can O
do O
some O
things O
some O
days O
and O
not O
the O
next O
. O
 
I O
second O
what O
madichan O
said O
If O
she O
had O
a O
job O
that O
involved O
a O
lot O
of O
paperwork O
, O
then O
she O
might O
enjoy O
some O
fake O
forms O
to O
fill O
in O
and O
sort O
through O
. O
Jigsaws O
are O
always O
a O
big O
hit O
, O
and O
even O
something O
like O
growing O
some O
plants O
. O
It O
s O
really O
good O
for O
them O
to O
have O
an O
ongoing O
project O
that O
they O
can O
look O
forward O
to O
and O
see O
the O
progress O
of O
Even O
just O
having O
her O
with O
you O
as O
you O
go O
about O
doing O
chores O
. O
She O
may O
not O
be O
actively O
helping O
, O
but O
she O
ll O
feel O
as O
though O
she O
s O
being O
of O
use O
and O
that O
s O
what O
s O
important O
Maybe O
mix O
up O
a O
load O
of O
small O
bits O
of O
coloured O
paper O
and O
get O
her O
to O
sort O
the O
colours O
into O
piles O
. O
Or O
perhaps O
ask O
her O
to O
help O
make O
up O
some O
little O
gift O
bags O
of O
sweets O
for O
the O
neighbours O
. O
She O
could O
sit O
and O
sort O
through O
it O
all O
. O
Obviously O
nothing O
too O
complex O
, O
like O
a O
crossword O
puzzle O
. O
I O
ve O
also O
seen O
adult O
versions O
of O
those O
painting O
mats O
for O
kids O
. O
The O
ones O
where O
the O
ink O
only O
paints O
on O
the O
mat O
, O
and O
the O
colours O
sort O
of O
just O
appear O
. O
I O
think O
they O
re O
water O
activated O
. O
They O
re O
great O
because O
it O
feels O
like O
you O
re O
actually O
painting O
something O
awesome O
Not O
sure O
how O
advanced O
your O
grandma O
s O
dementia B-DIS
is O
, O
but O
you O
can O
also O
buy O
incredibly O
lifelike O
stuffed O
animals O
. O
I O
ve O
seen O
a O
cat O
that O
breathes O
and O
I O
actually O
thought O
it O
was O
real O
Patients O
love O
to O
look O
after O
them O
and O
pet O
them O
. O
 
I O
m O
going O
to O
chime O
in O
with O
the O
others O
and O
say O
that O
disconnecting O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
use O
it O
as O
a O
signal O
that O
I O
m O
ready O
for O
sexy O
times O
. O
Hey O
babe O
, O
I O
just O
disconnected O
my O
pump O
... O
. O
if O
you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O
... O
 
Tried O
it O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
. O
First O
time O
sublingually O
I O
think O
it O
helped O
pull O
me O
out O
of O
a O
flare B-DIS
. O
Kept O
taking O
it O
daily O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
but O
then O
stopped O
for O
no O
particular O
reason O
. O
Started O
getting O
symptoms O
again O
some O
months O
later O
, O
tried O
it O
again O
and O
it O
didn O
t O
really O
do O
much O
. O
Also O
tried O
oil B-DRUG
capsules I-DRUG
and O
again O
, O
didn O
t O
really O
feel O
much O
improvement O
. O
But O
my O
Crohn O
s O
has O
been O
progressively O
getting O
worse O
over O
the O
last O
12-18 O
months O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
m O
currently O
waiting O
for O
my O
first O
operation O
. O
I O
do O
think O
for O
mild O
Crohn O
s O
you O
could O
get O
some O
relief O
using O
CBD B-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
, O
but O
I O
think O
at O
a O
certain O
point O
of O
the O
disease O
becoming O
aggressive O
, O
the O
oil O
just O
can O
t O
put O
up O
enough O
of O
a O
fight O
. O
 
I O
am O
so O
happy O
you O
are O
feeling O
better O
And O
thanks O
for O
coming O
back O
and O
sharing O
what O
has O
potentially O
been O
what O
worked O
for O
you O
and O
the O
stuff O
about O
Stanford O
. O
I O
will O
say O
that O
the O
first O
point O
on O
EBV B-DIS
as O
being O
the O
thing O
that O
defines O
someone O
as O
having O
CFS B-DIS
vs O
something O
else O
un-diagnosed O
is O
not O
true O
but O
I O
do O
think O
EBV B-DIS
seems O
to O
be O
the O
most O
common O
trigger O
in O
this O
subreddit.. O
so O
probably O
in O
America O
Canada O
UK O
. O
I O
went O
to O
a O
tropical O
disease O
specialist O
that O
told O
me O
I O
had O
CFS B-DIS
and O
that O
the O
trigger O
was O
malaria B-DIS
. O
She O
said O
it O
is O
rare O
, O
but O
she O
has O
seen O
other O
cases O
and O
that O
it O
takes O
years O
to O
recover O
from O
CFS B-DIS
Post-viral B-DIS
fatigue I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
from O
the O
cases O
she O
has O
seen O
triggered O
by O
malaria B-DIS
. O
She O
also O
said O
about O
1 O
3rd O
of O
patients O
with O
dengue B-DIS
fever I-DIS
develop O
it O
too O
. O
So O
there O
are O
other O
things O
that O
trigger O
this O
disease O
. O
She O
otherwise O
wasn O
t O
helpful O
in O
anything O
that O
would O
speed O
up O
the O
process O
. O
 
Don O
t O
do O
it O
, O
I O
m O
here O
to O
talk O
if O
you O
want O
to O
 
wish O
i O
could O
 
yes O
, O
at O
this O
point O
i O
dont O
want O
or O
can O
get O
better O
. O
it O
will O
come O
to O
you O
. O
there O
is O
always O
hope O
. O
however O
this O
isnt O
a O
thing O
that O
will O
go O
away O
one O
day O
. O
it O
s O
here O
to O
stay O
. O
if O
you O
treat O
yourself O
well O
do O
DBT O
, O
eat O
properly O
, O
sleep O
, O
exercise O
and O
abuse O
no O
substances O
you O
will O
feel O
much O
better O
. O
much O
much O
much O
better O
. O
 
How O
long O
have O
you O
been O
using O
it O
Have O
you O
noticed O
that O
you O
take O
it O
at O
all O
 
I O
went O
to O
Ireland O
for O
a O
week O
. O
Not O
quite O
as O
long O
as O
you O
. O
However O
, O
it O
as O
super O
easy O
. O
You O
ll O
have O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
enough O
formula O
but O
all O
that O
stuff O
is O
free O
. O
Just O
call O
the O
airline O
ahead O
of O
time O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
go O
through O
the O
metal O
detectors O
and O
they O
did O
a O
pat O
down O
but O
other O
than O
that O
the O
airline O
was O
super O
easy O
. O
I O
pretty O
much O
walked O
around O
Ireland O
with O
my O
backpack O
attached O
. O
Any O
particular O
questions O
please O
feel O
free O
to O
ask O
 
You O
re O
old O
and O
grizzled O
and O
your O
fingers O
are O
all O
scars O
 
Does O
your O
stent O
have O
a O
string O
attached O
so O
you O
can O
remove O
it O
yourself O
 
Neuropsychologist O
here O
. O
1 O
. O
Good O
on O
you O
for O
encouraging O
an O
assessment O
by O
professionals O
. O
2 O
. O
VERY O
bad O
on O
you O
for O
making O
a O
diagnostic O
assumption O
based O
on O
a O
few O
behaviors O
. O
This O
could O
be O
loads O
of O
things O
besides O
a O
dementia B-DIS
. O
That O
s O
why O
we O
have O
multiple O
MDs O
and O
PhDs O
involved O
in O
the O
differential O
diagnostic O
process O
. O
3 O
. O
Your O
experience O
as O
a O
caregiver O
in O
the O
past O
allows O
you O
to O
participate O
in O
1 O
above O
, O
but O
NOT O
2 O
. O
Kindly O
leave O
that O
to O
those O
of O
us O
licensed O
to O
do O
so O
. O
 
Well O
the O
are O
covered O
, O
but O
only O
after O
deductibles O
are O
met O
. O
Every O
year O
for O
the O
past O
5 O
years O
or O
more O
they O
have O
gone O
up O
considerably O
, O
and O
I O
ve O
been O
on O
pretty O
decent O
employer O
plans O
. O
My O
deductible O
is O
up O
to O
4000 O
now O
with O
out O
of O
pocket O
maximum O
around O
7000 O
 
Is O
this O
the O
sort O
of O
question O
that O
we O
should O
be O
answering O
I O
don O
t O
know O
if O
asking O
fellow O
patients O
for O
medical O
advice O
opinion O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
. O
POTS B-DIS
manifests O
so O
differently O
and O
people O
are O
different O
. O
You O
should O
just O
talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
. O
He O
has O
your O
chart O
and O
knows O
your O
situation O
better O
than O
strangers O
on O
an O
internet O
do O
. O
If O
you O
feel O
that O
his O
advice O
isn O
t O
working O
, O
ask O
him O
for O
changes O
, O
or O
find O
another O
doctor O
. O
 
hi O
folks O
- O
brand O
new O
to O
the O
community O
so O
sorry O
if O
i O
missed O
this O
previously O
but O
just O
curious O
where O
does O
the O
money O
come O
from O
wellth O
website O
seems O
legit O
but O
does O
not O
explain O
 
You O
are O
definately O
overdoing O
it O
. O
I O
know O
that O
doesn O
t O
help O
because O
life O
requires O
it O
it O
seems O
. O
Rest O
is O
key O
. O
If O
you O
can O
find O
any O
way O
to O
be O
able O
to O
lose O
even O
1 O
shift O
a O
week O
then O
that O
could O
help O
. O
The O
more O
you O
stress O
and O
over O
push O
your O
limits O
the O
worse O
this O
is O
going O
to O
get O
. O
 
It O
seems O
pretty O
normal O
to O
me O
that O
you O
don O
t O
want O
to O
think O
about O
you O
feeling B-DIS
lost I-DIS
, O
weak B-DIS
and I-DIS
sad I-DIS
. O
I O
m O
suicidal B-DIS
, O
too O
. O
There O
are O
days O
that O
I O
think O
that O
everything O
sucks O
and O
my O
life O
is O
a O
small O
circle O
of O
shit O
. O
The O
next O
day O
I O
wake O
up O
and O
feel O
better O
so O
I O
don O
t O
want O
to O
think O
about O
me O
feeling O
bad O
but O
just O
feel O
good O
while O
it O
lasts O
. O
Thats O
probably O
not O
very O
clever O
, O
but O
I O
totally O
get O
you O
. O
You O
are O
not O
a O
cry O
baby O
or O
a O
pathologic O
liar O
but O
just O
a O
person O
, O
who O
enjoys O
the O
times O
not O
feeling O
like O
shit O
. O
 
Problem O
is O
I O
feel O
so O
emotionally O
connected O
to O
him O
. O
It O
s O
like O
he O
owns O
a O
piece O
of O
me O
I O
can O
never O
get O
back O
. O
 
I O
am O
new O
to O
BPD B-DIS
and O
this O
forum O
but O
I O
completely O
relate O
to O
the O
feeling O
you O
describe O
. O
These O
moments O
come O
over O
me O
... O
it O
seems O
like O
all O
the O
colour O
just O
drains O
out O
of O
the O
scene O
... O
and O
all O
I O
feel O
is O
pain B-DIS
and O
extreme B-DIS
hopelessness I-DIS
. O
I O
recently O
started O
therapy O
however O
and O
I O
am O
hoping O
to O
develop O
what O
I O
believe O
is O
called O
distress B-DIS
tolerance I-DIS
. O
Have O
you O
got O
access O
to O
therapy O
 
I O
was O
recently O
diagnosed O
with O
GP B-DIS
and O
have O
been O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
hospital O
where O
the O
docs O
think O
I O
m O
there O
just O
for O
the O
pain O
meds O
too O
. O
I O
went O
to O
the O
Mayo O
clinic O
and O
it O
has O
been O
a O
God O
send O
. O
If O
you O
can O
, O
I O
highly O
recommend O
them O
to O
anyone O
. O
But O
they O
put O
me O
on O
a O
low O
fiber O
, O
low O
fat O
, O
high O
protein O
diet O
for O
GP B-DIS
and O
that O
has O
helped O
significantly O
. O
I O
was O
going O
to O
the O
hospital O
every O
2-3 O
weeks O
for O
the O
last O
8 O
months O
and O
it O
has O
now O
been O
a O
month O
since O
I O
ve O
last O
been O
. O
Hope O
this O
helps O
. O
I O
know O
this O
can O
be O
a O
hard O
road O
to O
travel O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
where O
she O
has O
been O
mentally O
. O
 
I O
m O
not O
certain O
, O
but O
I O
think O
my O
PTSD B-DIS
came O
before O
the O
dysautonomia B-DIS
set O
in O
. O
That O
s O
something O
to O
consider O
, O
though O
- O
thanks O
 
Absolutely..I O
do O
not O
like O
myself O
at O
all..even O
when O
I O
do O
ok O
at O
things O
it O
doesn O
t O
change O
the O
way O
I O
think O
about O
myself..working O
out O
has O
helped O
me O
like O
the O
physical O
image O
but O
nothing O
more O
 
Thank O
you O
. O
I O
m O
really O
scared O
about O
having O
a O
tube O
, O
how O
it O
s O
going O
to O
be O
put O
in O
, O
whether O
I O
m O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
stand O
the O
feeling O
of O
it O
in O
place O
I O
have O
Asperger O
s O
so O
am O
super O
aware O
of O
small O
irritations O
, O
and O
what O
the O
reality O
of O
having O
one O
will O
be O
like O
- O
all O
the O
kit O
, O
having O
to O
do O
it O
all O
alone O
, O
what O
people O
will O
say O
or O
how O
they O
will O
look O
at O
me O
when O
I O
go O
out.. O
 
Huh O
. O
I O
was O
wondering O
what O
he O
d O
say O
about O
people O
who O
didn O
t O
show O
any O
evidence O
of O
past O
EBV B-DIS
infection I-DIS
, O
but O
he O
s O
hypothesizing O
that O
it O
could O
be O
any O
number O
of O
serious O
herpes-class B-DIS
viruses I-DIS
. O
I O
wonder O
what O
Ron O
Davis O
and O
his O
team O
would O
think O
about O
the O
hypothesis O
Maybe O
that O
s O
a O
dumb O
question O
... O
seems O
like O
they O
d O
be O
well O
aware O
of O
any O
published O
hypotheses O
and O
research O
on O
CFS B-DIS
. O
 
I O
love O
your O
energy O
. O
 
Okay O
, O
thanks O
. O
I O
think O
my O
dad O
said O
that O
it O
was O
a O
much O
bigger O
headache B-DIS
to O
hire O
someone O
not O
from O
an O
agency O
because O
of O
taxes O
or O
something O
... O
 
I O
was O
actually O
putting O
together O
a O
small O
basket O
of O
things O
like O
puzzles O
and O
coloring O
books O
and O
assorted O
craft O
things O
they O
could O
do O
Thank O
you O
, O
this O
just O
further O
validates O
my O
attempt O
at O
a O
care O
package O
 
Well O
there O
s O
got O
ta O
be O
a O
reason O
why O
people O
hate O
me O
because O
of O
my O
skin O
color O
. O
People O
hate O
me O
just O
like O
people O
hate O
Satan O
. O
 
Mine O
was O
only O
1 O
hour O
and O
was O
definitely O
conclusive O
. O
 
Any O
follow O
up O
on O
this O
Provided O
they O
have O
ruled O
out O
diabetes B-DIS
, O
it O
could O
be O
POTS B-DIS
related O
. O
My O
Stanford O
autonomic B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
neurologist O
said O
many O
POTS B-DIS
patients O
feel O
excessive B-DIS
thirst I-DIS
frequently O
 
this O
is O
refreshing O
to O
read O
, O
thanks O
. O
 
If O
you O
re O
near O
Austin O
I O
know O
a O
doctor O
who O
takes O
Tricare O
and O
will O
test O
for O
antibodies B-DIS
. O
 
I O
m O
literally O
the O
same O
way O
. O
I O
anticipate O
yelling O
even O
by O
people O
who O
I O
have O
no O
reason O
to O
think O
or O
imagine O
would O
. O
My O
mom O
was O
very O
abusive O
growing O
up O
, O
pair O
that O
with O
alcoholism B-DIS
and O
pills O
and O
well O
, O
it O
s O
a O
recipe O
for O
misery O
. O
When O
she O
was O
drunk O
, O
she O
would O
barge O
into O
my O
room O
without O
knocking O
and O
start O
yelling O
at O
me O
. O
I O
m O
27 O
now O
and O
don O
t O
live O
at O
home O
. O
I O
live O
with O
my O
older O
sister O
and O
her O
BF O
. O
So O
today O
I O
was O
just O
sitting O
in O
my O
room O
and O
for O
some O
reason O
was O
just O
so O
paranoid B-DIS
and O
anxious B-DIS
that O
my O
sister O
was O
going O
to O
come O
in O
and O
yell O
at O
me O
. O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
why O
. O
It O
s O
hard O
to O
explain O
, O
makes O
no O
sense O
. O
And O
men O
... O
... O
. O
don O
t O
even O
get O
me O
started O
with O
how O
I O
feel O
and O
react O
with O
them O
. O
 
That O
s O
true O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
say O
, O
there O
are O
stones B-DIS
that O
can O
be O
dissolved O
. O
Thanks O
 
I O
just O
started O
the O
workbook O
along O
with O
TAU B-DRUG
and O
within O
the O
first O
few O
days O
i O
felt O
much O
more O
stable O
 
Is O
this O
a O
bot O
 
What O
did O
the O
Neurologist O
say O
What O
did O
the O
MRI O
show O
There O
could O
be O
many O
different O
causes O
for O
the O
current O
symptoms O
. O
I O
definitely O
recommend O
getting O
well O
thru O
the O
diagnosis O
process O
before O
planning O
for O
any O
specific O
situation O
illness O
. O
 
Unfortunately O
I O
think O
it O
s O
time O
to O
go O
to O
24 O
hour O
care O
. O
It O
s O
now O
or O
a O
couple O
months O
down O
the O
road O
. O
We O
faced O
the O
same O
thing O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
the O
nicest O
place O
close O
to O
you O
. O
Family O
is O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
for O
people O
with O
Dementia B-DIS
. O
It O
s O
going O
to O
be O
tough O
but O
take O
it O
one O
step O
at O
a O
time O
and O
get O
it O
taken O
care O
of O
. O
Good O
luck O
with O
everything O
. O
 
Yeah O
, O
I O
ve O
kicked O
my O
fiance O
multiple O
times O
. O
I O
worry O
one O
day O
I O
m O
going O
to O
injure O
one O
of O
our O
cats O
. O
It O
definitely O
sucks O
. O
I O
sincerely O
wish O
you O
the O
best O
going O
forward O
-- O
and O
if O
things O
go O
down O
the O
same O
road O
for O
me O
I O
might O
be O
back O
with O
some O
more O
questions O
. O
 
He O
started O
me O
on O
10,000IU O
for O
the O
vitamin O
D. O
I O
should O
have O
added O
that O
in O
my O
post O
, O
but O
thank O
you O
for O
addressing O
it O
. O
 
Have O
you O
seen O
a O
ENT O
specialist O
If O
you O
ve O
ruled O
out O
allergies B-DIS
, O
it O
could O
be O
caused O
by O
post B-DIS
nasal I-DIS
drip I-DIS
. O
 
What O
s O
your O
diagnosis O
, O
and O
what O
are O
you O
eating O
 
Oh O
, O
man O
, O
that O
sounds O
difficult O
Keto O
involves O
high O
fat O
, O
too O
, O
doesn O
t O
it O
There O
s O
so O
much O
conflicting O
advice O
out O
there O
. O
It O
sounds O
like O
everyone O
agrees O
on O
at O
least O
gluten O
, O
though O
. O
 
thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O
I O
have O
just O
bought O
a O
tin O
of O
sustegen B-DRUG
so O
hopefully O
that O
will O
be O
good O
for O
a O
while O
and O
then O
Ill O
need O
to O
start O
this O
diet O
 
My O
doctor O
who O
manages O
my O
POTS B-DIS
prescribed O
me O
cyclobenzaprine B-DRUG
flexeril B-DRUG
so O
I O
d O
say O
you O
re O
good O
to O
go O
 
I O
m O
just O
went O
through O
the O
exact O
same O
thing O
. O
My O
doctor O
was O
hesitant O
to O
diagnose O
me O
with O
M O
ni O
re O
s O
because O
my O
hearing O
is O
perfect O
when O
I O
m O
not O
having O
an O
attack O
, O
but O
there O
s O
really O
not O
much O
else O
it O
could O
be O
at O
this O
point O
so O
I O
m O
on O
a O
diuretic B-DRUG
and O
meclizine B-DRUG
. O
Also O
, O
my O
right O
bad O
ear O
failed O
that O
test O
where O
they O
blow O
cold O
and O
warm O
air O
into O
your O
ear O
miserably O
so O
they O
went O
ahead O
with O
the O
diagnosis O
. O
I O
m O
30 O
years O
old O
and O
I O
ve O
been O
having O
symptoms O
about O
9 O
months O
total O
-- O
I O
got O
the O
diagnosis O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
. O
Edit O
words O
. O
 
Your O
prospects O
aren O
t O
as O
poor O
as O
you O
might O
think O
. O
A O
few O
suggestions O
Put O
your O
illness O
right O
in O
your O
dating O
profile O
. O
You O
don O
t O
have O
to O
put O
it O
in O
bold O
print O
right O
at O
the O
top O
, O
but O
put O
it O
out O
there O
and O
be O
upfront O
. O
No O
point O
in O
even O
starting O
a O
conversation O
if O
this O
is O
a O
deal-breaker O
. O
Be O
matter-of-fact O
about O
your O
illness O
, O
and O
don O
t O
blow O
it O
up O
. O
Just O
tell O
people O
what O
your O
limitations O
are O
. O
Don O
t O
be O
like O
Oh O
I O
have O
this O
secret O
to O
tell O
you O
that O
I O
think O
will O
scare O
you O
off O
. O
Not O
only O
will O
you O
find O
that O
not O
everyone O
is O
scared O
off O
, O
but O
you O
ll O
ATTRACT O
people O
who O
identify O
with O
what O
you O
re O
going O
through O
or O
people O
who O
identity O
as O
care-takers O
. O
Other O
chronically O
ill O
people O
feel O
exactly O
like O
you O
do O
. O
You O
are O
not O
alone O
. O
Be O
careful O
of O
projecting O
is O
a O
woe-is-me O
attitude O
. O
Yeah O
CFS B-DIS
SUUUUCKS O
but O
try O
to O
project O
as O
positive O
an O
image O
as O
you O
can O
. O
A O
poor O
self-image O
and O
poor O
attitude O
does O
more O
to O
ruin O
your O
chances O
than O
your O
illness O
does O
. O
Know O
that O
you O
are O
a O
worthy O
romantic O
parter O
, O
even O
if O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
are O
not O
. O
You O
will O
meet O
people O
, O
you O
will O
go O
on O
dates O
, O
you O
will O
make O
connections O
, O
and O
you O
WILL O
get O
laid O
. O
Also O
, O
be O
persistent O
, O
and O
be O
friendly O
. O
Keep O
reaching O
out O
to O
people O
. O
Sometimes O
laying O
in O
bed O
chatting O
with O
strangers O
online O
can O
be O
a O
positive O
social O
outlet O
, O
even O
if O
it O
doesn O
t O
lead O
to O
anything O
. O
 
Yeah O
. O
That O
isn O
t O
going O
to O
help O
you O
at O
all O
. O
If O
you O
truly O
need O
disability O
, O
you O
know O
what O
will O
help O
A O
*lawyer* O
. O
Get O
a O
lawyer O
. O
They O
would O
have O
told O
you O
up O
front O
that O
this O
is O
a O
waste O
of O
time O
, O
and O
sent O
you O
to O
a O
specialist O
from O
their O
rolodex O
who O
can O
emphasize O
this O
for O
you O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
reliable O
to O
the O
courts O
. O
 
I O
found O
some O
I O
had O
left O
from O
a O
previous O
kidney B-DIS
stone I-DIS
experience O
so O
I O
took O
one O
. O
Thank O
you O
 
I O
wish O
I O
couldn O
t O
care O
anymore O
. O
Nothing O
s O
in O
my O
control O
 
People O
claim O
they O
care O
about O
you O
when O
your O
down O
, O
but O
I O
find O
that O
hard O
to O
believe O
sometimes O
. O
Because O
it O
usually O
comes O
off O
as O
being O
nice O
for O
the O
sake O
of O
it O
. O
Not O
because O
they O
legitimately O
care O
. O
 
I O
m O
still O
in O
search O
of O
long O
-term O
, O
sustained O
relief O
. O
Stimulants B-DRUG
are O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
seems O
to O
help O
and O
only O
sometimes O
. O
I O
m O
trying O
to O
better O
understand O
histamine B-DRUG
s O
role O
, O
and O
how O
diet O
impacts O
that O
. O
 
I O
m O
sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
that O
, O
friend O
. O
What O
types O
of O
things O
are O
you O
paying O
attention O
to O
in O
your O
diet O
, O
and O
are O
you O
finding O
that O
you O
are O
producing O
them O
at O
a O
slower O
rate O
 
Yes O
Nothing O
about O
my O
diet O
or O
lifestyle O
has O
changed O
and O
it O
seems O
every O
other O
day O
I O
m O
having O
an O
attack O
. O
Do O
we O
have O
research O
to O
back O
this O
theory O
up O
 
That O
is O
how O
I O
feel O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
meds O
actually O
doing O
fuck O
all O
to O
help O
me O
. O
I O
get O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
no O
matter O
what O
I O
do O
though O
, O
I O
m O
thin O
and O
don O
t O
drink O
caffeine O
, O
alcohol O
, O
fizzy O
drinks O
or O
eat O
before O
bed O
etc O
 
Right O
now O
, O
the O
only O
things O
the O
doctors O
have O
to O
go O
on O
is O
a O
positive O
Rocky B-DIS
Mountain I-DIS
Spotted I-DIS
Fever I-DIS
test O
. O
I O
m O
waiting O
to O
see O
a O
specialist O
, O
so O
I O
can O
not O
say O
for O
sure O
if O
that O
cause O
this O
crash O
or O
not O
. O
The O
reason O
I O
say O
that O
is O
because O
I O
was O
treated O
with O
a O
round O
of O
doxycycline B-DRUG
, O
no O
improvement O
, O
and O
I O
m O
still O
just O
as O
sick O
. O
I O
will O
say O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
had O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
and O
I O
also O
had O
mild O
CFS B-DIS
beforehand O
. O
In O
mid O
April O
, O
I O
took O
a O
turn O
for O
the O
worse O
and O
I O
ve O
been O
between O
bedridden O
and O
housebound O
ever O
since O
. O
The O
pain B-DIS
got O
a O
lot O
worse O
, O
to O
the O
point O
I O
take O
Tramadol B-DRUG
at O
night O
to O
control O
it O
, O
and O
so O
did O
the O
nausea B-DIS
, O
dizziness B-DIS
and O
fatigue B-DIS
. O
As O
for O
gastroparesis B-DIS
, O
I O
have O
not O
considered O
it O
. O
I O
had O
frequent B-DIS
nausea I-DIS
before O
I O
got O
this O
sick O
, O
it O
just O
got O
a O
lot O
worse O
. O
I O
don O
t O
have O
any O
of O
the O
fullness O
or O
bloating B-DIS
of O
gastroparesis B-DIS
patients O
. O
I O
tried O
taking O
Reglan B-DRUG
, O
a O
common O
gastroparesis O
medication O
, O
and O
it O
didn O
t O
do O
anything O
for O
the O
nausea B-DIS
, O
only O
made O
me O
agitated B-DIS
. O
I O
do O
have O
IBS B-DIS
, O
though O
. O
Again O
, O
not O
new O
. O
Just O
exacerbated O
. O
I O
m O
also O
working O
on O
getting O
a O
counselor O
, O
one O
to O
visit O
me O
at O
home O
or O
Skype O
. O
I O
really O
really O
need O
it O
. O
 
My O
first O
drop B-DIS
attack I-DIS
was O
in O
2006 O
. O
It O
lasted O
more O
than O
a O
month O
. O
It O
was O
mild O
for O
many O
years O
and O
started O
to O
increase O
after O
2010 O
. O
In O
2015 O
I O
got O
a O
job O
where O
I O
was O
commuting O
1 O
15 O
either O
way O
, O
it O
went O
nuclear O
and O
hasn O
t O
let O
up O
since O
. O
I O
went O
from O
having O
one O
or O
two O
drop B-DIS
attacks I-DIS
a O
month O
to O
four O
or O
five O
a O
week O
. O
Always O
with O
some O
level O
of O
underlying O
and O
constantly O
variable O
vertigo B-DIS
. O
Shit O
sucks O
, O
can O
t O
drive O
Somedays O
and O
have O
to O
work O
from O
home O
. O
You O
live O
and O
get O
on O
with O
it O
. O
 
I O
found O
that O
my O
father O
is O
somewhat O
hostile O
to O
males O
- O
he O
was O
quite O
unpleasant O
with O
the O
male O
PT O
who O
I O
got O
to O
come O
out O
to O
do O
an O
eval O
. O
and O
would O
not O
comply O
with O
about O
half O
of O
what O
he O
was O
asked O
to O
do O
... O
That O
said O
, O
I O
would O
have O
to O
consider O
it O
- O
especially O
as O
summer O
is O
coming O
. O
 
That O
springtime O
bad O
juju O
is O
real O
Glad O
I O
m O
not O
alone O

i O
can O
feel O
my O
heartbeat O

the O
time O
btw O
. O
had O
that O
checked O
aswell O
, O
but O
everything O
turned O
out O
normal O
there O
. O
depression B-DIS
could O
be O
the O
issue O
but O
iam O
not O
sure O
. O
if O
i O
wont O
suffer O
from O
this O
strong B-DIS
tiredness I-DIS
and O
memory B-DIS
issues I-DIS
i O
wouldnt O
have O
negative B-DIS
thoughts I-DIS
. O
on O
some O
rare O
days O

body O
is O
functioning O
normal O
and O
iam O
feeling O
well O
. O
iam O
the O
most O
happy O
man O
alive O

Ah O

d O
contacted O
one O
of O
the O
trial O
s O
coordinators O
to O
learn O
more O
and O
ultimately O
decided O
on O
the O
gentamicin B-DRUG
. O
Though O
the O
idea O
of O
a O
gel O
as O
opposed O
to O
standard O
liquid O
injection O
makes O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
in O
general O
. O
 
Definitely O
second O
the O
coding O
to O
17 O
. O
 
I O
appreciate O
you O
reading O
everything O
. O
It O
s O
nice O
to O
know O
that O
someone O
is O
listening O
. O
 
Awesome O
, O
thank O
you O
so O
much O
. O
This O
helped O
me O
a O
great O
deal O
Really O
changed O
my O
perspective O
on O
anxiety B-DIS
in O
general O
, O
and O
I O
ve O
been O
having O
much O
better O
mornings O
after O
reading O
Thanks O
for O
being O
a O
great O
resource O
. O
I O
also O
really O
enjoy O
your O
writing O
style O
 
Ah O
yeah O
. O
That O
sounds O
a O
lot O
more O
like O
POTS B-DIS
or O
similar O
. O
If O
the O
Holter O
doesn O
t O
show O
anything O
request O
a O
tilt O
table O
. O
My O
tilt O
didn O
t O
show O
significant O
signs O
of O
POTS B-DIS
, O
but O
on O
the O
day O
I O
was O
actually O
feeling O
great O
and O
was O
asymptomatic O
. O
That O
can O
happen O
too O
so O
if O
on O
the O
day O
of O
a O
test O
you O
re O
asymptomatic O
let O
the O
doctor O
know O
. O
You O
could O
also O
request O
a O
24 O
hour O
blood O
pressure O
monitor O
 
I O
had O
quite O
a O
few O
test O
done O
. O
They O
gave O
me O
a O
colonoscopy O
and O
an O
endoscopy O
and O
found O
nothing O
. O
From O
catscans O
to O
x-rays O
. O
Everything O
looked O
fine O
to O
them O
. O
It O
made O
me O
hopeless O
at O
the O
time O
but O
then O
I O
started O
talking O
to O
other O
diabetics B-DIS
and O
doing O
research O
online O
and O
it O
came O
down O
to O
two O
things O
. O
Either O
gastroparesis B-DIS
or O
gastropathy B-DIS
. O
I O
would O
ask O
your O
endocrinologist O
if O
they O
think O
either O
of O
those O
fit O
your O
symptoms O
. O
 
Very O
true O
I O
m O
just O
so O
surprised O
and O
confused O
. O
It O
s O
been O
consistent B-DIS
pain I-DIS
since O
early O
October O
and O
awful B-DIS
mobility I-DIS
every O
day O
, O
I O
haven O
t O
had O
a O
good O
day O
until O
today O
, O
so O
it O
s O
super O
surprising O
I O
just O
wish O
I O
knew O
if O
it O
was O
something O
I O
ve O
done O
so O
I O
could O
keep O
it O
up O
. O
 
How O
is O
your O
hearing O
Have O
you O
noticed O
any O
changes O
since O
the O
onset O
of O
your O
symptoms O
clogged B-DIS
ears I-DIS
, O
tinnitus B-DIS
, O
pressure B-DIS
, O
loss B-DIS
of I-DIS
hearing I-DIS
, O
etc O
No O
it O
s O
fine O
The O
suggestion O
for O
the O
thyroid O
parathyroid O
testing O
is O
also O
very O
wise O
. O
Yep O
, O
had O
them O
test O
for O
those O
issues O
. O
Within O
15 O
days O
I O
ll O
receive O
my O
results O
If O
I O
were O
you O
, O
I O
d O
probably O
start O
with O
an O
ENT O
specialist O
because O
of O
the O
dizzyness B-DIS
. O
You O
could O
have O
a O
problem O
with O
your O
inner O
or O
middle O
ear O
or O
your O
sinuses B-DIS
which O
coyld O
explain O
each O
of O
those O
symptoms O
. O
An O
MRI O
or O
a O
CT O
Scan O
might O
prove O
helpful O
in O
diagnosis O
, O
or O
at O
least O
eliminating O
other O
diagnoses O
. O
If O
you O
don O
t O
get O
anywhere O
there O
, O
I O
think O
my O
next O
stop O
would O
be O
a O
neurologist O
. O
Yep O
, O
an O
MRI O
and O
a O
CT O
scan O
will O
be O
done O
Thanks O
 
Medicaid O

offered O
through O
the O
state O
Department O

With O
the O
Power O
of O

, O
you O
can O
fill O
out O

You O
will O
need O
to O
bring O
documentation O
of O

social O
security O
, O
bank O

, O

. O
We O
were O
lucky O
because O
in O
my O
town O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
homes O
accepted O
Medicaid O
. O
The O
issue O
we O
found O
was O
that O
a O
lot O
of O
them O
were O
full O
. O
Luckily O
, O
we O
were O
able O
to O
get O
her O
into O
a O
nice O
facility O
. O
I O
visit O
every O
other O
day O
and O
have O
not O
noticed O
any O
concerns O
about O
treatment O
, O
cleanliness O
, O
etc O
. O
A O
certain O
percentage O
of O
her O
Social O
Security O
like O
90 O
, O
I O
believe O
, O
is O
going O
to O
pay O
the O
home O
each O
month O
. O
This O
does O
not O
leave O
a O
lot O
of O
money O
to O
pay O
her O
old O
bills O
, O
but O
we O
are O
doing O
our O
best O
. O
 
Ndt B-DRUG
or O
adding O
t3 B-DRUG
to O
your O
levo B-DRUG
does O
make O
MOST O
people O
feel O
better O
, O
there O
is O
always O
an O
exception O
of O
course O
. O
As O
far O
as O

. O
Gluten O
free O
is O
a O
must O
and O
then O
varying O

Some O
like O
myself O
go O
as O
far O
as O
gluten O
dairy O
caffeine O
soy O
sugar O
grain O
nightshade O
free O
. O
Its O
hard O
but O
it O
truely O
helps O
alot O
. O
Make O
sure O
you O
get O
sleep O
Even O
if O
it O
requires O
melatnonin B-DRUG
meds O
cpap O
whatever O
helps O
you O
. O
A O
good O
regular O

is O
essential O

Could O
be O

, O
allergy B-DIS
, O

, O
food B-DIS
poisoning I-DIS
. O
It O
s O
IBS B-DIS
when O
everything O
else O
has O
already O
been O
excluded O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
if O
I O
remember O
well O
but O
you O
can O
call O
it O
IBS B-DIS
when O
symptoms O
appear O
at O
least O
twice O
a O
week O
for O
3 O
months O
straight O
. O
You O
should O
focus O
on O
your O
diet O
and O
lifestyle O
because O
there O
could O
be O
some O
connections O
. O
 
rheumatologists O
deal O
in O
auto B-DIS
immune I-DIS
diseases I-DIS
, O
but O
it O
sounds O
like O
they O
suspect O
you O
have O
EDS B-DIS
. O
I O
d O
start O
with O
a O
geneticist O
over O
a O
rheumatologist O
. O
 
From O
my O
experience O
, O
the O
ER O
will O
get O
Kidney B-DIS
Stone I-DIS
patients O
back O
pretty O
quickly O
. O
Just O
let O
them O
know O
you O
are O
in O
a O
lot O
of O
pain B-DIS
and O
that O
you O
suspect O
a O
kidney B-DIS
stone I-DIS
. O
I O
ve O
have O
been O
hooked O
up O
to O
an O

Well O
there O
is O
zero O
scientific O
support O
for O

, O
no O

. O
I O
suspect O
if O
he O
could O
actually O
cure O
AIDS B-DIS
, O
herpes B-DIS
, O
leukemia B-DIS
, O
sickle B-DIS
cell I-DIS
anemia I-DIS
, O
lupus B-DIS
he O
would O
be O
a O
celebrated O
genius O
. O
USHA O
has O
used O
this O

to O

such O
pathologies O
as O

This O

confirms O

was O
a O

it O

almost O
everything O
And O
if O
that O

you O
maybe O
a O

Any O

sugar I-DIS
. O
Not O
necessarily O
. O
It O
differs O
from O
person O
to O
person O
. O
I O
find O
that O
if O
I O
eat O
low-carb O
with O
high O
protein O
, O
I O
need O
to O
bolus O
a O
little O
anyways O
. O
However O
, O
if O
I O
eat O
the O
same O
portion O
of O
protein O
with O
carbs O
, O
the O
amount O
I O
bolus O
just O
for O
the O
carbs O
is O
enough O
. O
 
There O
are O
A O
LOT O
of O
non-opioid O

out O
there O

to O
find O
a O
massive O

I O
don O
t O
tolerate O
NSAIDS B-DRUG
anymore O
but O
I O
ve O
taken O
the O
following O
with O

Advil B-DRUG
, O
Naproxen B-DRUG
, O
Meloxicam B-DRUG
, O
Indomethacin B-DRUG
, O
Diclofenac B-DRUG
oral O
and O
topical O
, O
Celebrex B-DRUG
. O
I O
ve O
stuck O
with O
alternating O
Tylenol B-DRUG
and O
Advil B-DRUG
when O
I O
have O
acute B-DIS
pain I-DIS
issues I-DIS
because O
it O
s O
cheap O
. O
In O
my O
chronic O
times O
I O
loved O
Celebrex B-DRUG
, O
but O
no O
longer O
take O
it O
. O
 
Yeah O
but O
you O
have O
to O
eat O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
calories O
. O
Can O
t O
just O
stay O
away O
from O
food O
, O
like O
. O
 
Actually O
a O
good O
Dr. O
to O
see O
in O

would O
be O
Mark O
Davis O

He O
used O
to O
do O
FMT O

He O
may O
be O
able O

give O
you O
some O
good O
ideas O
for O
FYI O

He O
is O
actually O
on O
the O
board O
for O
the O
Fecal O
Transplant O
Foundation O
. O
 
It O
s O
in O
my O
username O
because O
I O
have O
different O

for O
different O
personal O

My O

is O
some O

I O
ve O
been O
trying O
to O
find O
an O
AHA B-DRUG
which O
work O
but O
seem O
to O
be O
hitting O
a O
brick O
wall O
. O
 
This O
is O
what O
I O
m O
afraid O
of O
. O
Starting O
next O
year O
I O
ll O
be O
off O
my O
parent O
s O
nice O
insurance O
and O
have O
to O
go O
through O
work O
. O
It O
ll O
be O
a O
2k O
deductible O
and O
4K O
max O
. O
Right O
now O
I O
pay O
100 O
for O
a O
colonoscopy O
and O
most O
of O
my O
meds O
are O
5 O
, O
maybe O
15 O
. O
I O
m O
already O
saving O
because O
I O
know O
I O
ll O
it O
ll O
be O
rough O
. O
What O
s O
sucks O
is O
that O
my O
company O
just O
switched O
to O
high-deductible O
plans O
starting O
this O
year O
, O
and O
this O
is O
my O
best O
option O
. O
 
I O
can O
vouch O
for O
the O
testicle B-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
it O
does O
happen O
. O
IMO O
I O
think O
I O
get O
it O
right O
when O
the O
stone B-DIS
is O
attempting O
to O
cross O
the O
ureter O
bladder O
barrier O
. O
Seems O
like O
the O
nerves O
down O
there O
are O
all O
interconnected O
. O
 
Noticeable O
kidney B-DIS
issues I-DIS
Nope O
. O
Bun O
cr O
has O
been O
low O
on O
tests O
though O
but O
doctors O
never O
mentioned O
it O
. O
Not O
sure O
if O
that O
s O
sufficient O
to O
cause O
problems O
. O
 
It O
s O
a O
strange O
feeling O
that O
is O
hard O
to O
describe O
to O
most O
people O
. O
You O
ve O
been O
sleeping O
all O
your O
life O
, O
but O
after O
you O
get O
a O
cpap B-DRUG
for O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
, O
it O
s O
like O
sleeping O
for O
the O
first O
time O

Ginger B-DRUG
is O
a O
miracle O
drug O
. O
Tea O
, O
pills O
, O
whichever O
. O
If O
it O
s O
the O
tea O
, O
make O
it O
REALLY O
strong O
with O
actual O
ginger B-DRUG
. O
the O
stuff O
that O
comes O
in O
bags O
is O
so O
weak O
to O
the O
point O
of O
kind O
of O
being O
a O
joke O
. O
 
I O
m O
sorry O
to O
hear O
you O
had O
such O
a O
bad O
experience O
with O
DOs O
Where O
I O
m O
from O
they O
are O
well O
respected O
and O
in O
some O
cases O
preferred O
 
Yep O
, O
been O
referred O
, O
just O
haven O
t O
had O
the O
appointment O
yet O
. O
Idk O
. O
I O
ve O
known O
for O
a O
long O
time O
with O
the O
family O
history O
that O
one O
day O
I O
may O
find O
myself O
with O
it O
or O
something O
else O
autoimmune B-DIS
related O
. O
But O
26 O
Thought O
I O
could O
at O
least O
get O
into O
my O
30s O
first O
. O
Too O
young O
for O
this O
shit O
. O
 
Actually O
, O
not O
an O
easy O
question O
. O
Are O
you O
asking O
about O
permanent B-DIS
hearing I-DIS
loss I-DIS
or O
vestibular B-DIS
dysfunction I-DIS
, O
or O
the O
temporary B-DIS
loss I-DIS
during O
an O
MD B-DIS
episode O
The O
two O
are O
very O
different O
and O
treated O
differently O
. O
As O
a O
former O
MD B-DIS
patient O
I O
found O
I O
could O
manage O
my O
symptoms O
fairly O
well O
with O
careful O
diet O
. O
Today O
I O
manage O
my O
left B-DIS
sided I-DIS
hearing I-DIS
loss I-DIS
with O
a O
cochlear O
implant O
and O
can O
do O
just O
about O
anything O
I O
want O
. O
 
Okay O
, O
good O
luck O
 
You O
could O
see O
another O
doctor O
in O
case O
your O
current O
one O
is O
just O
assuming O
you O
can O
t O
have O
anything O
unusual O
. O
Meanwhile O
, O
it O
couldn O
t O
hurt O
to O
start O
a O
wellness O
program O
on O
your O
own O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
Parkinsons B-DIS
is O
involved O
. O
If O
you O
re O
not O
up O
for O
running O
then O
do O
some O
walking O
jogging O
or O
cycling O
, O
start O
a O
low-key O
weightlifting O
program O
. O
Boost O
your O
nutrition O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can O
, O
check O
with O
the O
doctor O
to O
see O
if O
you O
can O
take O
supplements O
that O
would O
help O
your O
heart O
. O
Dig O
into O
sleep O
hygiene O
and O
see O
if O
you O
can O
knock O
out O
that O
insomnia B-DIS
, O
because O
that O
is O
depleting O
your O
physical O
health O
. O
What O
s O
going O
on O
with O
the O
depression B-DIS

are O
you O
under O

three O
infusions O
. O
The O
first O
two O
were O
two O
weeks O
apart O
, O
and O
involved O
eight O
hour O
sessions O
with O
some O
steroids B-DRUG
and O
benedryl B-DRUG
to O
help O
with O
allergic B-DIS
reactions I-DIS
. O
So O
far O
, O
no O
new O
activity O
or O
flares B-DIS
, O
and O
the O
lesions B-DIS
that O
were O
active O
when O
I O
started O
aren O
t O
active O
any O
more O
. O
I O
was O
averaging O
about O
2 O
flares O
a O
year O
before O
treatment O
as O
far O
as O
we O
can O
tell O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
noticed O
any O
lasting O
side O
effects O
other O
than O
a O
super O
slow B-DIS
recovery I-DIS
from I-DIS
getting I-DIS
sick I-DIS
, O
but O
who O
knows O
if O
it O
s O
related O
. O
I O
don O
t O
take O
daily O
meds O
other O
than O
muscle B-DRUG
relaxers I-DRUG
and O
MMJ B-DRUG
for O
pain B-DIS
. O
As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
, O
it O
s O
pretty O
safe O
and O
very O
effective O
. O
Ocrelizumab B-DRUG
is O
the O
humanized O
version O
. O
 
Staph B-DIS
lives O
on O
all O
of O
us O
, O
a O
weak B-DIS
immune I-DIS
system I-DIS
is O
what O
causes O
the O
infections B-DIS
. O
My O
psoriasis B-DIS
presented O
majorly O
after O
I O
took O
a O
big O
round O
of O
antibiotics B-DRUG
killing O
of O
my O
immune O
system O
. O
 
Question O
, O
will O
the O
low B-DIS
libido I-DIS
fix O
itself O
or O
do O
you O
need O
to O
take O
injections B-DRUG
or O
whatever O
ongoing O
My O
thyroid O
levels O
are O
stable O
and O
have O
been O
for O
about O
a O
year O
now O
, O
but O
my O
libido O
has O
never O
recovered O
. O
 
Yep O
, O
about O
4 O
or O
5 O
doctors O
ran O
a O
few O
tests O
and O
said O
I O
was O
fine O
. O
It O
wasn O
t O
until O
I O
had O
about O
7 O
symptoms O
that O
all O
screamed O
MS B-DIS
that O
a O
doctor O
ordered O
an O
MRI O
and O
a O
lumbar O
puncture O
. O
It O
s O
almost O
funny O
, O
I O
couldn O
t O
be O
diagnosed O
until O
my O
symptoms O
were O
bad O
enough O
to O
be O
identifiable O
, O
but O
by O
then O
a O
lot O
of O
permanent O
damage O
had O
been O
done O
. O
 
Well O
, O
multiple B-DIS
lesions I-DIS
multiple B-DIS
sclerosis I-DIS
, O
so O
if O
you O
re O
showing O
none O
whatsoever O
, O
then O
you O
can O
probably O
rule O
that O
out O
. O
As O
far O
as O
neuropathy B-DIS
, O
there O
are O
so O
many O
different O
things O
that O
can O
cause O
that O
, O
so O
waiting O
for O
more O
info O
is O
about O
as O
much O
advice O
as O
I O
can O
give O
you O
. O
Hope O
things O
work O
out O
for O
the O
best O
. O
 
I O
have O
a O
friend O
who O
s O
daughter O
has O
ITP B-DIS
and O
they O
use O
one O
for O
her O
blood O
draws O
. O
I O
think O
you O
will O
find O
though O
, O
that O
over O
time O
the O
shots O
really O
aren O
t O
what O
tends O
to O
hurt O
- O
after O
16 O
years O
I O
still O
think O
fingersticks O
are O
waaaaay O
worse O
than O
an O
insulin B-DRUG
shot O
... O
BUT O
, O
if O
it O
s O
helping O
for O
now O
, O
by O
all O
means O
you O
should O
use O
it O
Sometimes O
it O
s O
the O
little O
things O
that O
can O
make O
all O
the O
difference O
for O
the O
PWD O
Also O
, O
not O
sure O
what O
needles O
you O
are O
using O
, O
but O
there O
are O
31g O
6mm O
syringes O
from O
BD O
, O
and O
32g O
4mm O
pen O
needles O
... O
both O
are O
a O
long O
way O
from O
the O
1 O
2 O
29g O
nails O
they O
use O
in O
the O
hospital O
... O
 
My O
goal O
is O
to O
just O
drink O
water O
period O
. O
I O
m O
using O
Crystal O
light O
as O
a O
crutch O
for O
now O
. O
I O
m O
also O
trying O
to O
seen O
myself O
off O
of O
excess O
fat O
, O
so O
I O
can O
lose B-DIS
weight I-DIS
and O
maybe O
get O
healthier O
and O
to O
a O
better O
weight B-DIS
. O
 
Well O
shit O
. O
I O
guess O
now O
that O
I O
don O
t O
work O
or O
anything O
I O
don O
t O
need O
to O
be O
too O
clear-headed O
lol O
. O
I O
ll O
give O
whatever O
they O
prescribe O
me O
a O
shot O
I O
guess O
. O
 
It O
helps O
my O
spasticity B-DIS
loads O
Anything O
else O
, O
be O
damned O
if O
I O
know O
 
If O
all O
you O
had O
run O
was O
RF O
, O
ESR O
and O
UA O
, O
you O
need O
a O
lot O
more O
tests O
. O
CBC O
, O
ANA O
, O
CRP O
, O
CCP O
, O
HLA-B27 O
to O
start O
. O
You O
can O
also O
ask O
for O
a O
nuclear O
scintigraphy O
. O
 
What O
else O
has O
changed O
in O
the O
last O
six O
months O
, O
that O
may O
coincide O
with O
your O
current O
condition O
Have O
you O
started O
a O
new O
diet O
, O
or O
are O
you O
eating O
different O
foods O
Are O
you O
exercising O
more O
or O
less O
Have O
you O
been O
extra O
busy O
and O
stressed O
at O
work O
Perhaps O
there O
is O
something O
causing O
this O
that O
you O
can O
identify O
and O
take O
action O
to O
resolve O
the O
issue O
. O
Good O
luck O
 
Asking O
the O
wrong O
lady O
. O
I O
was O
just O
diagnosed O
recently O
so O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
. O
My O
guess O
is O
you O
eliminate O
them O
from O
your O
diet O
and O
see O
if O
there O
is O
an O
improvement O
. O
 
RA B-DIS
is O
inflammation B-DIS
of I-DIS
the I-DIS
joints I-DIS
... O
beginning O
with O
smaller O
joints O
amp O
; O
progressing O
to O
larger O
joints O
. O
If O
you O
are O
having O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
the I-DIS
webbing I-DIS
of I-DIS
your I-DIS
fingers I-DIS
, O
it O
s O
not O
RA B-DIS
bc O
there O
aren O
t O
joints O
there O
. O
While O
a O
ANA O
is O
used O
to O
dx O
RA B-DIS
along O
with O
sed O
rates O
, O
one O
does O
NOT O
have O
to O
have O
these O
to O
dx O
RA B-DIS
. O
Also O
, O
ANA O
does O
not O
always O
show O
up O
in O
blood O
draws O
right O
away O
. O
As O
a O
nurse O
who O
has O
RA B-DIS
though O
, O
yours O
does O
not O
sound O
like O
RA B-DIS
. O
 
I O
ve O
been O
taking O
birth B-DRUG
control I-DRUG
for O
8 O
months O
now O
. O
Before O
the O
birth O
control O
I O
was O
absolutely O
miserable O
during O
that O
time O
of O
the O
month O
. O
My O
IBS O
pain B-DIS
is O
almost O
always O
in O
my O
lower O
abdomen O
, O
so O
when O
menstrual O
cramps O
occurred O
it O
was O
3x O
worse O
than O
normal O
. O
I O
would O
be O
crying O
in O
bed O
all O
day O
because O
of O
the O
pain O
. O
I O
started O
taking O
Blisovi B-DRUG
Fe I-DRUG
1 I-DRUG
20 B-DRUG
. O
My O
periods O
steadily O
got O
lighter O
and O
almost O
non O
existent O
and O
the O
cramps O
definitely O
improved O
. O
I O
actually O
missed O
my O
period O
last O
month O
, O
but O
it O
caught O
up O
to O
me O
today O
lol O
I O
know O
every O
woman O
s O
body O
is O
different O
though O
. O
I O
also O
thought O
I O
d O
mention O
there O
are O
doctors O
who O
test O
your O
hormones O
. O
If O
that O
was O
a O
real O
big O
issue O
they O
could O
pinpoint O
what O
imbalance O
you O
ve O
got O
going O
on O
. O
 
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
response O
. O
I O
m O
going O
to O
tell O
my O
mom O
about O
this O
so O
she O
can O
encourage O
him O
since O
it O
s O
so O
important O
. O
 
I O
never O
really O
thought O
that O
it O
may O
just O
be O
how O
I O
m O
perceiving O
my O
symptoms O
, O
which O
would O
make O
a O
lot O
of O
sense O
because O
my O
discomfort B-DIS
is O
similar O
to O
the O
feeling O
I O
get O
when O
I O
actually O
have O
to O
pee O
. O
And O
I O
haven O
t O
really O
tried O
cutting O
much O
out O
before O
, O
but O
I O
m O
planning O
on O
actually O
following O
the O
diet O
sheet O
a O
lot O
more O
strictly O
to O
see O
if O
it O
makes O
a O
difference O
. O
Do O
you O
know O
how O
long O
it O
should O
take O
to O
start O
feeling O
differences O
I O
probably O
really O
need O
to O
get O
a O
second O
opinion O
since O
from O
what O
I O
ve O
seen O
, O
most O
people O
diagnosed O
have O
had O
some O
sort O
of O
testing O
. O
My O
doctor O
just O
talked O
to O
me O
and O
gave O
me O
the O
diagnosis O
, O
I O
didn O
t O
even O
get O
an O
exam O
or O
anything O
. O
 
What O
happened O
to O
me O
was O
my O
nails B-DIS
had I-DIS
itty I-DIS
bitty I-DIS
little I-DIS
dents I-DIS
and I-DIS
pits I-DIS
, O
it O
looked O
like O
a O
miniature O
woodpecker O
attacked O
them O
. O
Then O
later O
I O
had B-DIS
scale I-DIS
start I-DIS
under I-DIS
my I-DIS
nail I-DIS
, O
forcing O
it O
up O
and O
becoming O
even O
more O
misshapen O
. O
That O
hurt B-DIS
so O
much O
, O
just O
the O
pressure B-DIS
under I-DIS
my I-DIS
nails I-DIS
. O
After O
a O
bath O
or O
shower O
, O
I O
would O
use O
these O
really O
fine O
tweezers O
to O
remove O
some O
of O
the O
scale O
. O
But O
it O
was O
just O
awful O
. O
 
Oh O
nice O
, O
thank O
you O
Never O
heard O
of O
it O
before O
. O
I O
ll O
take O
a O
look O
. O
 
I O
believe O
that O
it O
is O
indeed O
possible O
for O
some O
people O
to O
get O
past O
having O
GP B-DIS
, O
depending O
on O
why O
you O
got O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place O
You O
are O
SO O
lucky O
Reglan B-DRUG
never O
worked O
for O
me O
and O
I O
hate O
taking O
pills O
anyways O
, O
so O
I O
have O
been O
existing O
on O
zofran B-DRUG
and O
using O
Headspace O
for O
meditation O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
all O
of O
the O
best O
Please O
let O
me O
know O
how O
you O
re O
doing O
and O
if O
you O
continue O
to O
improve O
 
Well O
, O
it O
s O
not O
that O
I O
won O
t O
go O
. O
Obviously O
that O
is O
the O
preferred O
option O
. O
But O
not O
all O
of O
us O
have O
the O
insurance O
or O
money O
. O
I O
am O
simply O
asking O
has O
it O
ever O
happened O
to O
anyone O
and O
if O
so O
did O
it O
turn O
out O
that O
it O
happened O
due O
to O
color O
in O
food O
or O
supplements O
. O
 
Yeah O
, O
they O
tested O
me O
for O
everything O
under O
the O
sun O
first O
Pregnancy B-DIS
- O
liver B-DIS
complaints I-DIS
- O
bacterial B-DIS
infections I-DIS
. O
As O
fir O
the O
botox B-DRUG
... O
i O
only O
had O
them O
two O
days O
ago O
. O
The O
actual O
injections O
themselves O
were O
quite O
painful B-DIS
Sorry O
if O
that O
freaks O
anyone O
out O
just O
want O
to O
be O
honest O
and O
afterwards O
my O
stomach B-DIS
was I-DIS
cramping I-DIS
. O
Which O
wasn O
t O
great O
but O
not O
too O
bad O
for O
me O
to O
be O
able O
to O
sleep O
. O
The O
second O
day O
was O
fine O
. O
I O
was O
exhausted B-DIS
like O
usual O
but O
not O
in O
a O
great O
deal O
of O
pain O
. O
Today O
it O
s O
been O
almost O
like O
a O
regular O
good O
day O
. O
Very O
little O
nausea B-DIS
. O
Lots O
of O
noises O
coming O
from O
my O
tummy O
. O
To O
be O
totally O
honest O
I O
m O
not O
100 O
confindent O
in O
it O
having O
worked O
to O
clear O
me O
of O
the O
nausea O
. O
But O
I O
m O
still O
hopeful O
I O
ll O
see O
more O
results O
as O
time O
goes O
one O
. O
 
Worth O
trying O
I O
used O
Fexofenadine B-DRUG
with O
success O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
. O
Hydroxyzine B-DRUG
is O
also O
usually O
recommended O
also O
. O
 
Yeah O
that O
makes O
so O
much O
sense O
. O
Goodness O
it O
s O
crazy O
how O
long O
these O
ridiculous O
diagnosis O
take O
. O
Makes O
you O
wan O
na O
punch O
someone O
in O
the O
face O
lol O
. O
I O
really O
hope O
they O
set O
you O
on O
a O
good O
treatment O
plan O
from O
here O
on O
out O
 
I O
had O
chronic B-DIS
headaches I-DIS
and O
was O
probably O
hypoglycemic B-DIS
but O
in O
a O
more O
normal O
way O
I O
had O
to O
eat O
breakfast O
right O
when O
I O
woke O
up O
. O
I O
did O
go O
to O
PT O
for O
injury B-DIS
from I-DIS
overuse I-DIS
I O
was O
studying O
music O
in O
college O
and O
got O
tendinitis B-DIS
from O
playing O
too O
much O
and O
my O
PT O
was O
really O
puzzled O
as O
to O
why O
my O
ribs O
were O
so O
far O
forward O
. O
Other O
than O
that O
, O
nothing O
like O
it O
is O
now O
post-mono B-DIS
which O
was O
2.5 O
years O
ago O
 
Reglan B-DRUG
10 O
mg. O
Once O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
once O
at O
bed O
time O
and O
viberzi B-DRUG
twice O
a O
day O
I O
believe O
they O
are O
100mg O
and O
they O
helped O
so O
much O
. O
Reglan B-DRUG
can O
be O
scary O
because O
of O
the O
side O
effect O
of O
the O
facial B-DIS
twitches I-DIS
but O
start O
off O
on O
a O
low O
dose O
and O
work O
up O
from O
there O
to O
settle O
your O
anxiety B-DIS
. O
Viberzi B-DRUG
is O
for O
IBS B-DIS
and O
it O
helps O
slow O
down O
your O
colon O
and O
controls O
abdominal B-DIS
cramping I-DIS
and O
upset B-DIS
tummies I-DIS
. O
It O
has O
been O
a O
life O
saver O
 
Mmhm O
. O
 
I O
wonder O
if O
we O
do O
actually O
have O
lower O
rates O
of O
IC B-DIS
here O
, O
or O
it O
s O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
being O
genuinely O
backwards O
- O
half O
the O
GPs O
I O
ve O
seen O
have O
never O
heard O
of O
Elmiron B-DRUG
, O
disturbingly O
, O
also O
most O
pharmacists O
. O
I O
don O
t O
think O
AZO B-DRUG
is O
available O
here O
either O
iHerb O
etc O
, O
have O
it O
though O
- O
legal O
to O
import O
. O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
formulations O
like O
Uribel B-DRUG
etc O
, O
I O
am O
a O
bit O
more O
hazy O
on O
the O
status O
. O
Does O
the O
marshmallow O
root O
work O
for O
you O
at O
all O
It O
did O
for O
me O
in O
the O
beginning O
, O
but O
seems O
to O
no O
longer O
been O
effective O
. O
Haha O
, O
I O
definitely O
get O
you O
regarding O
the O
cysto B-DIS
. O
Mine O
was O
in O
a O
public O
hospital O
on O
Medicare O
... O
thought O
to O
myself O
free O
is O
good O
right O
and O
ended O
up O
with O
a O
few O
minor O
to O
moderate O
urethral B-DIS
tears I-DIS
couldn O
t O
work O
for O
2 O
weeks O
, O
spent O
the O
time O
more O
or O
less O
crying O
in O
the O
shower O
... O
so O
much O
for O
cheap O
I O
find O
opioids B-DRUG
are O
ineffective O
here O
too O
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
secret O
knowledge O
that O
only O
the O
patients O
themselves O
seem O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
... O
GPs O
and O
specialists O
see O
them O
as O
a O
panacea O
, O
even O
though O
opioids B-DRUG
haven O
t O
demonstrated O
analgesic O
effects O
for O
most O
IC B-DIS
patients O
as O
well O
as O
folks O
with O
neuropathic B-DIS
pain I-DIS
in O
trials O
. O
With O
the O
antacids B-DRUG
, O

at O
buffering O
their O

prevent O
formations O
of O
kidney B-DIS
stones I-DIS
with O

so O
it O
may O
be O
worth O

I O
have O
a O
satchet O
every O
evening O
with O
180mg O
of O
Fexofenadine O
broken O
up O
into O
a O
morning O
and O
night O
dose O
which O
seems O
to O
be O
sufficient O
for O
now O
. O
Have O
tried O
Lyrica B-DRUG
and O
tricyclics B-DRUG
with O
no O
effect O
. O
Have O
it O
next O
on O
my O
list O
 
to O
get O
the O
TGA O
approval O
for O
Atarax B-DRUG
, O
failing O
that O
Elmiron B-DRUG

and O
later O
an O

am O

patients O
, O
as O
our O
system O
here O
appears O
not O
just O
quite O
different O
, O
but O
also O
terribly O
fragmented O
. O
I O
ll O
pop O
a O
link O
on O
this O
subreddit O
when O
I O
have O
a O
beta O
ready O
Keep O
me O
posted O

how O
you O
go O
with O
the O
Elmiron B-DRUG
 
You O
re O
welcome O
. O
I O
m O
glad O
I O
could O
help O
. O
Yeah O
, O
the O
thing O
about O
the O
stages O
of O
grief B-DIS
is O
the O
first O
stage O
it O
starts O
off O
with O
*Denial* O
And O
that O
can O
be O
one O
of O
the O
hardest O
things O
to O
realize O
especially O
when O
you O
ve O
got O
someone O
else O
depending O
on O
you O
for O
just O
about O
everything O
that O
they O
need O
all O
. O
the O
. O
time O
. O
I O
mean O
, O
I O
wouldn O
t O
say O
that O
she O
was O
ignoring O
it O
. O
I O
d O
say O
more O
that O
it O
just O
wasn O
t O
important O
at O
the O
time O
. O
If O
she O
s O
anything O
like O
me O
, O
I O
have O
a O
bad O
tendency O
to O
push O
my O
own O
feelings O
off O
as O
unimportant O
when O
someone O
else O
needs O
me O
or O
is O
going O
through O
a O
hard O
time O
. O
The O
thing O
I O
have O
to O
remember O
I O
can O
t O
take O
care O
of O
anyone O
else O
effectively O
if O
I O
don O
t O
take O
care O
of O
myself O
first O
. O
I O
hope O
things O
get O
better O
. O
I O
truly O
do O
. O
Communication O
is O
extremely O
important O
, O
and O
if O
having O
a O
moderator O
makes O
it O
easier O
, O
go O
for O
it O
. O
Don O
t O
hesitate O
to O
PM O
me O
if O
you O
want O
. O
Keep O
us O
updated O
. O
and O
by O
us O
, O
I O
mean O
me O
and O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
MS B-DIS
community O
. O
 
Dermatologist O
, O
apparently O
he O
s O
the O
best O
in O
my O
city O
. O
My O
mom O
paid O
for O
it O
because O
I O
m O
still O
under O
her O
insurance O
, O
so O
sorry O
I O
m O
not O
too O
sure O
about O
how O
much O
it O
costs O
. O
 
So O
sorry O
to O
hear O
you O
went O
through O
this O
. O
I O
ve O
passed B-DIS
two I-DIS
stones I-DIS
in O
the O
past O
2 O
years O
, O
most O
recent O
being O
2 O
weeks O
ago O
, O
but O
I O
know O
it O
s O
usually O
more O
painful B-DIS
for O
men O
. O
If O
you O
don O
t O
have O
one O
already O
, O
find O
a O
local O
urologist O
. O
If O
you O
bring O
the O
stone B-DIS
to O
them O
, O
they O
can O
send O
it O
out O
for O
testing O
to O
see O
what O
it O
s O
composed O
of O
. O
That O
will O
help O
narrow O
down O
the O
cause O
, O
and O
further O
, O
effective O
treatment O
and O
prevention O
. O
The O
urologist O
might O
also O
have O
you O
get O
a O
couple O
scans O
done O
. O
After O
I O
passed O
my O
last O
one O
, O
I O
got O
scans O
done O
that O
showed O
I O
have O
2 O
more O
in O
there O
, O
3mm O
amp O
; O
4mm O
stones B-DIS
, O
so O
they O
are O
OK O
but O
still O
very O
, O
very O
painful O
to O
pass O
on O
their O
own O
. O
Lithotripsy O
procedures O
can O
be O
done O
for O
larger O
stones B-DIS
to O
help O
break O
them O
up O
and O
make O
them O
easier O
to O
pass O
, O
but O
they O
are O
usually O
only O
performed O
on O
stones B-DIS
6mm O
and O
larger O
. O
It O
is O
recommended O
for O
most O
types O
of O
kidney B-DIS
stones I-DIS
to O
lower O
salt O
intake O
and O
increase O
water O
intake O
. O
The O
type O
of O
stone B-DIS
will O
help O
determine O
what O
foods O
drinks O
to O
avoid O
. O
You O
made O
it O
through O
the O
hard O
part O
, O
so O
congrats O
Hope O
there O
aren O
t O
anymore O
for O
you O
 
Update O
second O
hearing O
test O
showed O
pronounced O
drop B-DIS
off I-DIS
in I-DIS
word I-DIS
recognition I-DIS
50 O
. O
Is O
this O
something O
that O
can O
be O
recovered O
, O
or O
is O
the O
nerve B-DIS
fried I-DIS
 
Well O
, O
usually O
a O
big O
stone B-DIS
like O
yours O
gets O
stuck O
in O
the O
ureter O
somewhere O
and O
just O
wedges O
itself O
stuck O
and O
causes O
all O
kinds O
of O
inflammation B-DIS
, O
bruising B-DIS
, O
bleeding B-DIS
etc- O
and O
that O
s O
what O
causes O
the O
extreme B-DIS
kidney I-DIS
stone I-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
After O
they O
remove O
the O
stone O
manually O
in O
a O
surgery O
, O
that O
ureter O
passage O
is O
still O
going O
to O
be O
inflammed B-DIS
and O
beat O
up O
. O
That O
passage O
will O
then O
clamp O
itself O
shut O
from O
swelling B-DIS
, O
which O
can O
t O
be O
allowed O
to O
happen O
because O
that O
will O
cut O
off O
that O
kidney O
from O
your O
bladder O
and O
damage O
the O
kidney O
amp O
; O
risk O
putting O
you O
into O
sepsis B-DIS
. O
So O
they O
put O
a O
ureter O
stent O
in O
so O
if O
it O
tries O
to O
swell O
shut O
there O
is O
a O
tube O
to O
maintain O
urine O
flow O
. O
But O
, O
when O
the O
passage O
is O
spasming B-DIS
against O
the O
tube O
it O
will O
give O
you O
kidney B-DIS
stone-type I-DIS
pain I-DIS
in O
the O
same O
spot O
. O
It O
will O
happen O
after O
urination O
and O
just O
randomly O
, O
but O
not O
for O
very O
long O
usually O
15-45min O
and O
become O
less O
and O
less O
frequent O
after O
the O
stent O
is O
removed O
. O
For O
me O
I O
felt O
90 O
better O
the O
day O
of O
the O
surgery O
after O
I O
woke O
up O
and O
just O
slept O
in O
bed O
for O
a O
few O
days O
. O
Within O
a O
week O
I O
was O
I O
d O
say O
95-97 O
back O
to O
normal O
if O
I O
took O
it O
easy O
no O
working O
out O
in O
a O
gym O
, O
doing O
any O
serious O
exercise O
etc O
with O
the O
pain B-DIS
being O
far O
less O
often O
than O
before O
the O
surgery O
. O
After O
the O
first O
week O
or O
two O
post-op O
the O
spasms B-DIS
were O
fairly O
infrequent O
. O
You O
should O
actually O
be O
glad O
you O
re O
getting O
the O
surgery O
. O
Its O
actually O
less O
painful O
to O
get O
a O
laser O
lith O
. O
than O
it O
is O
to O
pass O
a O
smaller O
stone O
the O
old O
fashioned O
way O
. O
Obviously O
if O
you O
ve O
never O
had O
a O
surgery O
before O
its O
a O
 
bit O
intimidating O
but O
as O
far O
as O
surgeries O
go O
this O
one O
isn O
t O
that O
bad O
. O
Easier O
than O
getting O
your O
tonsils O
out O
. O
 
I O
mostly O
snack O
on O
slices O
of O
white O
bread O
, O
as O
it O
s O
the O
thing O
least O
likely O
to O
trigger O
me O
. O
I O
figure O
it O
s O
healthier O
than O
giving O
myself O
D O
. O
 
If O
you O
have O
something O
a O
Rheumatologist O
could O
treat O
, O
the O
steroids B-DRUG
may O
give O
you O
some O
relief O
. O
My O
first O
round O
of O

Hey O
, O
sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
your O
diagnosis O
I O
was O
just O
diagnosed O
with O
M O
ni O
re O
s O
about O
a O
month O
ago O
, O
and O
I O
found O
myself O
in O
a O
similar O
position O
early O
20 O
s O
male O
weighing O
190 O
and O
with O
a O
fast B-DIS
metabolism I-DIS
. O
I O
m O
not O
dairy O
gluten O
free O
so O
I O
have O
a O
few O
more O
options O
, O
but O
it O
s O
still O
tricky O
I O
ve O
lost O
7 O
pounds O
since O
starting O
on O
the O
low O
sodium O
diet O
. O
Personally O
I O
ve O
just O
been O
eating O
a O
lot O
more O
nuts O
, O
specifically O
fry O
roasted O
unsalted O
cashews O
and O
peanuts O
. O
I O
ve O
also O
become O
a O
fan O
of O
quinoa O
since O
it O
has O
more O
protein O
than O
pasta O
or O
rice O
. O
Lactose O
free O
yogurt O
is O
an O
option O
too O
. O
Hope O
that O
helps O
 
This O
page O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
information O
about O
dementia B-DIS
. O
You O
can O
download O
translations O
in O
Macedonian O
. O
Maybe O
reading O
some O
of O
these O
will O
help O
your O
Dad O
. O
 
No O
. O
One O
ear O
had O
it O
and O
then O
I O
started O
to O
notice O
progression O
in O
the O
other O
one O
. O
Tinnitus B-DIS
is O
constant O
. O
I O
tend O
to O
forget O
it O
s O
there O
until O
I O
remember O
about O
it O
. O
 
I O
think O
exactly O
that O
is O
one O
of O
the O
biggest O
problems O
. O
This O
saving O
the O
dignity O
, O
because O
many O
feel O
too O
much O
shame O
to O
let O
others O
help O
, O
especially O
in O
early O
stages O
. O
What O
helps O
a O
lot O
with O
the O
people O
I O
look O
after O
is O
not O
talking O
about O
it O
. O
Sounds O
strange O
, O
but O
it O
really O
helps O
. O
We O
have O
a O
routine O
, O
we O
take O
the O
people O
to O
the O
bathroom O
once O
after O
breakfest O
, O
once O
after O
or O
before O
lunch O
, O
and O
once O
around O
3 O
p.m O
. O
I O
m O
working O
in O
a O
day O
care O
center O
for O
dementia B-DIS
patients O
that O
still O
live O
at O
home O
and O
they O
leave O
around O
4 O
pm O
. O
The O
body O
gets O
accustomed O
to O
this O
routine O
after O
some O
time O
, O
so O
the O
accidents O
between O
those O
bathroom O
visits O
get O
really O
rare O
. O
Then O
we O
just O
ask O
them O
to O
come O
with O
us O
. O
Misses O
Mister O
X O
, O
will O
come O
with O
me O
a O
second O
and O
if O
they O
ask O
why O
, O
we O
never O
explicitly O
tell O
them O
what O
we O
are O
going O
to O
do O
, O
we O
say O
things O
like O
We O
just O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
a O
second O
. O
From O
what O
I O
ve O
witnessed O
, O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
less O
shame O
if O
you O
don O
t O
talk O
about O
their O
problems O
with O
how O
to O
properly O
take O
care O
of O
their O
natural O
waste O
. O
Also O
, O
it O
helps O
just O
talking O
there O
. O
Talk O
about O
whatever O
, O
what O
you O
are O
going O
to O
do O
later O
, O
what O
you O
have O
seen O
on O
television O
, O
whatever O
. O
Talk O
over O
any O
potential O
noises O
and O
avoid O
awkward O
silence O
. O
Inbetween O
, O
when O
you O
see O
that O
that O
they O
start O
doing O
something O
that O
is O
not O
the O
right O
way O
, O
like O
using O
their O
fingers O
, O
just O
politley O
stop O
them O
, O
tell O
them O
how O
to O
do O
it O
properly O
, O
and O
continue O
to O
talk O
about O
something O
different O
. O
Try O
to O
make O
it O
a O
completly O
 
normal O
part O
of O
the O
conversation O
without O
judging O
. O
Then O
, O
simply O
remind O
them O
to O
wash O
their O
hands O
and O
leave O
the O
bathroom O
. O
Do O
you O
think O
this O
could O
work O
with O
your O
wife O
Another O
method O
we O
used O
when O
I O
had O
to O
do O
an O
internship O
where O
we O
cared O
for O
the O
patients O
in O
their O
home O
was O
leaving O
notes O
, O
i.e O
a O
note O
next O
to O
the O
coffee O
mashine O
with O
Please O
don O
t O
foget O
to O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
, O
or O
in O
front O
of O
the O
toilet O
toilet O
paper O
is O
on O
the O
right O
side O
of O
you O
, O
etc O
. O
Sometimes O
, O
they O
simply O
forget O
where O
to O
find O
it O
, O
so O
they O
feel O
like O
they O
have O
to O
use O
the O
fingers O
. O
 
Unfortunately O
it O
is O
normal O
and O
can O
last O
for O
8 O
hours O
. O
My O
doctor O
said O
taking O
an O
anti B-DRUG
inflammatory I-DRUG
with O
the O
pain B-DRUG
meds I-DRUG
will O
lessen O
it O
. O
Also O
if O
you O
re O
still O
have O
the O
spasm B-DIS
tomorrow O
you O
should O
call O
your O
doctor O
because O
it O
shouldn O
t O
be O
hurting O
after O
tonight O
. O
 
There O
was O
a O
bit O
of O
discussion O
around O
this O
5m O
ago O
. O
Seems O
like O
the O
distraction O
pattern O
is O
tuned O
for O
Emma O
. O
May O
or O
may O
not O
help O
other O
patients O
and O
is O
undergoing O
field O
testing O
. O
But O
I O
think O
the O
MS B-DIS
keynote O
has O
given O
this O
a O
massive O
boost O
- O
Silicon O
Valley O
loves O
fixing O
hard O
problems O
with O
engineering O
, O
this O
is O
right O
in O
their O
mindset O
, O
and O
this O
will O
give O
a O
lot O
of O
eyes O
and O
funding O
to O
the O
topic O
. O
Since O
the O
device O
is O
external O
, O
medical O
field O
testing O
on O
humans O
could O
happen O
quickly O
and O
we O
ll O
see O
this O
sooner O
than O
say O
, O
consumption O
based O
medicine O
. O
I O
think O
as O
much O
as O
everyone O
would O
love O
to O
start O
brain O
hacking O
and O
fix O
their O
loved O
ones O
, O
it O
is O
prudent O
to O
have O
solid O
medical O
research O
behind O
this O
too O
. O
What O
if O
it O
doesn O
t O
work O
. O
What O
can O
be O
tweaked O
to O
work O
better O
. O
Does O
the O
brain O
develop O
resistance O
over O
time O
to O
watch O
s O
distraction O
. O
Does O
the O
pattern O
need O
to O
be O
randomized O
so O
the O
brain O
doesn O
t O
tune O
to O
it O
. O
More O
research O
the O
better O
. O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
wanting O
cheap O
Chinese O
knockoff O
devices O
that O
may O
or O
may O
not O
work O
is O
the O
right O
thinking O
. O
I O
almost O
want O
solid O
field O
trials O
and O
lots O
of O
medical O
companies O
to O
get O
involved O
formally O
. O
But O
at O
the O
same O
time O
, O
I O
hope O
the O
results O
would O
be O
affordable O
. O
 
Then O
just O
stop O
making O
excuses O
. O
Also O
, O
you O
don O
t O
need O
to O
go O
to O
the O
gym O
to O
lose O
weight O
. O
Just O
eat O
less O
. O
It O
s O
as O
simple O
as O
downloading O
an O
app O
that O
tracks O
your O
calories O
. O
 
I O
m O
on O
it O
. O
No O
major O
issues O
. O
My O
hair B-DIS
started I-DIS
to I-DIS
fall I-DIS
out I-DIS
, O
but O
I O
fixed O
that O
by O
taking O
biotin B-DRUG
. O
 
just O

just O
took O
too O
much O

D O
a O

I O
m O

it O
again O

linaclotide B-DRUG

IBS B-DIS

So O
, O
I O
am O
not O
happy O
about O
this O
and O
I O
want O
some O
advice O
if O
possible O
. O
When O
I O
asked O
if O
I O
can O
just O
take O
my O
prescription O
to O
some O
other O
company O
I O
was O
told O
no O

I O
find O
this O
hard O
to O
believe O

Assuming O
you O
re O
in O
the O
US O
, O
you O
are O
legally O
entitled O
to O
the O
doctor O
s O
order O
for O
the O
machine O
prescription O
and O
can O
take O
it O
to O
any O
equipment O
supplier O
in O
the O
world O
, O
including O
anybody O
on O
the O
internet O
. O
Your O
insurance O
company O
probably O
only O
pays O
companies O
they O
have O
contracts O
with O
, O
but O
in O
many O
cases O
your O
co-pay O
is O
the O
same O
as O
or O
more O
than O
the O
price O
on O
the O
internet O
so O
it O
might O
not O
make O
any O
difference O
if O
your O
insurance O
company O
pays O
or O
not O
. O
Also O
your O
insurance O
company O
will O
probably O
require O
a O
number O
of O
doctor O
visits O
to O
prove O
that O
you O
re O
using O
the O
machine O
. O
If O
your O
time O
is O
valuable O
, O
figure O
what O
the O
lost O
time O
is O
worth O
. O
If O
anybody O
gives O
you O
a O
hard O
time O
, O
ask O
them O
if O
they O
have O
every O
heard O
of O
HIPAA O
. O

; O
I O
want O
to O
be O
able O

out O
which O
machine O
I O
use O
I O
want O
one O
that O
will O
be O
easy O
to O
travel O
with O
and O
Im O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
will O
get O
that O
option O
with O
this O

Does O
this O
seem O
normal O
It O
seems O
normal O
that O
you O
re O
being O
railroaded O

It O
is O
not O
however O
good O

gt O
; O
Also O
, O
I O
have O
no O
information O
about O
my O
tests O

I O
am O
going O
to O
call O
and O
ask O
how O
many O
events O
I O
had O
per O
minute O
in O
my O

Is O
there O
anything O
else O
I O
should O
ask O
the O

See O
above O

You O

I O
also O

to O
request O
a O
mask O
fitting O
as O
during O
my O
test O
occasionally O
air O
would O
shoot O
out O
the O

I O
obviously O
do O

this O

Any O
other O
tips O
will O
be O
appreciated O

Most O
equipment O

have O
a O
30 O

policy O

Check O
before O
you O

It O

Plaquenil B-DRUG
is O
an O
immuno-suppressant O
which O
is O
probably O
why O
. O
Higher O
chance O
you O
could O
pick O
up O
an O
infection B-DIS
and O
not O
be O
able O
to O
fight O
it O
off O
. O
Iirc O
, O
they O
eye O
tests O
is O
because O
the O
drug O
can O
cause O
glaucoma B-DIS
I O
took O
it O
for O
a O
couple O
months O
back O
in O
2015 O
but O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
nauseated B-DIS
all O
the O
time O
and O
I O
started O
to O
get O
abdominal B-DIS
pains I-DIS
so O
I O
stopped O
. O
E O
actually O
, O
the O
glaucoma B-DIS
thing O
might O
have O
been O
another O
med O

tried O
on O
me O

go O
stretches O

about O
6 O
weeks O

I O
ve O
found O
that O

are O
the O
most O
effective O

for O
me O

I O
have O

My O

my O

something O

Turns O
out O
the O

I O
have O
enough O
spare O
UPSen O
floating O
around O
the O

to O
replace O
that O
one O
. O
 
I O
wouldn O
t O
start O
treatment O
until O
your O
happy O
with O
your O

You O
cant O
weigh O
up O
the O
pro O

of O

treatment O
with O
a O
foundation O

I O
was O

ask O

Being O
said O

one O
way O

it O

is O
to O
help O
a O

a O

ethical O
quota O

But O
it O
doesn O

always O
help O

If O
it O
s O
something O
you O

up O

something O

I O
have O

both O
sides O

The O
prescribing O
doctor O
does O
not O
lock O
you O
into O

Your O
prescription O

can O
be O
taken O

a O

Hope O
you O

5 O

Snake O
oil O
. O
 
I O
think O
pain B-DIS
management O
for O
RA B-DIS
is O
a O
poorly O
addressed O
topic O
. O
Most O
RA B-DIS
doctors O
want O
to O
treat O
with O
biological O
and O
dmard B-DRUG
options O
which O
makes O
sense O
, O
as O
when O
they O
work O
you O
have O
stalled O
the O
disease O
progression O
. O
But O
there O
are O
so O
many O
of O
us O
still O
dealing O
with O
either O
an O
acute B-DIS
flare I-DIS
, O
a O
chronic B-DIS
pain I-DIS
condition O
due O
to O
not O
finding O
the O
right O
treatment O
plan O
, O
or O
having O
done O
enough O
joint B-DIS
damage I-DIS
that O
chronic B-DIS
pain I-DIS
is O
your O
life O
Then O
there O
is O
the O
issue O
that O
what O
works O
for O
my O
pain B-DIS
doesn O
t O
work O
for O
you O
. O
Add O
to O
this O
the O
opioid O
epedemic O
a O
topic O
that O
worried O
me O
, O
since O
the O
media O
likes O
to O
dump O
prescription O
opioid O
deaths O
in O
with O
heroin B-DRUG
etc O
. O
Slightly O
different O
if O
you O
ask O
me O
, O
as O
this O
creates O
the O
illusion O
that O
opioid O
pill O
deaths O
are O
way O
higher O
than O
they O
are O
since O
they O
lump O
heroin O
and O
fentanyl B-DRUG
laced O
street O
drugs O
in O
together O
There O
seems O
to O
be O
no O
national O
or O
international O
approach O
to O
helping O
RA B-DIS
sufferers O
with O
their O
pain B-DIS
. O
NSAIDs B-DRUG
- O
destroy O
your O
stomach O
and O
some O
have O
been O
linked O
to O
heart B-DIS
issues I-DIS
Opioids B-DRUG
- O
apparently O
the O
media O
can O
t O
tell O
the O
difference O
between O
street O
drugs O
and O
prescription O
opioids O
. O
Nor O
can O
they O
understand O
the O
difference O
between O
dependence O
and O
addiction O
Pot B-DRUG
- O
doesn O
t O
work O
for O
everyone O
and O
far O
too O
many O
countries O
consider O
it O
the O
same O
as O
other O
illicit O
street O
drugs O
Prednisone B-DRUG
has O
enough O
side O
effects O
you O
could O
write O
a O
novel O
about O
it O
The O
list O
goes O
on O
and O
RA B-DIS
sufferers O
dealing O
with O
pain O
are O
left O
with O
very O
few O
viable O
options O
, O
and O
fewer O
RA B-DIS
docs O
that O
realize O
the O
devastating O
impact O
of O
chronic B-DIS
RA I-DIS
pain I-DIS
on O
our O
quality O
of O
life O
Just O
some O
rambling O
, O
since O
pain O
management O
come O
up O
here O
so O
often O
Sorry O
 
This O
might O
seem O
not O
helpful O
, O
bu O
if O
the O
job O
is O
causing O
you O
to O
trigger O
, O
you O
might O
need O
to O
consider O
a O
different O
job O
I O
know O
that O
sounds O
crazy O
, O
but O
if O
you O
can O
reduce O
your O
stress B-DIS
and O
limit O
attacks B-DIS
, O
that O
might O
be O
worth O
the O
reduction O
change O
in O
pay O
in O
the O
long O
run O
. O
Stress B-DIS
is O
often O
us O
fighting O
the O
reality O
of O
a O
situation O
. O
 
Thank O
you O
I O
can O
t O
imagine O
how O
frustrating O
the O
unpredictability O
of O
it O
can O
be O
Yeah O
, O
it O
sort O
of O
looks O
like O
a O
seizure O
for O
him O
, O
too O
. O
He O
falls O
drops O
to O
the O
ground O
wherever O
he O
is O
tenses B-DIS
up I-DIS
I O
think O
the O
tensing O
up O
is O
what O
causes O
a O
slight O
shake O
but O
then O
is O
fine O
almost O
immediately O
except O
for O
sweating B-DIS
being O
very O
tired O
and O
whatever O
scrapes O
cuts O
bruises O
the O
fall O
location O
caused O
. O
It O
s O
scary O
and O
humbling O
and O
gives O
me O
a O
very O
helpless O
feeling O
- O
and O
I O
can O
t O
imagine O
how O
it O
feels O
to O
have O
one O
. O
So O
far O
it O
has O
mostly O
been O
in O
one O
ear O
... O
I O
wonder O
if O
increased O
symptoms O
could O
be O
caused O
by O
activity O
in O
his O
other O
ear O
It O
all O
seems O
so O
different O
for O
each O
person O
, O
and O
confusing O
 
I O
was O
JUST O
wondering O
this O
yesterday O
, O
I O
feel O
as O
though O
I O
ve O
developed O
adhd B-DIS
and O
have O
a O
hard B-DIS
time I-DIS
concentrating I-DIS
on O
simple O
tasks O
at O
work O
or O
sometimes O
I O
start O
one O
task O
and O
move O
on O
to O
the O
next O
before O
just O
saying O
fuck O
this O
shit O
and O
sitting O
there O
the O
rest O
of O
the O
day O
being O
unproductive O
. O
 
Well O
, O
the O
migraines B-DIS
can O
be O
a O
symptom O
and O
then O
the O
rest O
are O
symptoms O
. O
So O
chances O
that O
if O
it O
meows O
, O
looks O
like O
a O
cat O
and O
licks O
it O
s O
butt O
like O
a O
cat O
... O
then O
it O
s O
probably O
a O
cat O
. O
Hopefully O
you O
have O
luck O
with O
some O
treatments O
. O
But O
so O
far O
, O
since O
gravol B-DRUG
makes O
me O
super O
sick O
, O
my O
choices O
have O
been O
ginger O
tablets O
, O
plenty O
of O
water O
, O
green O
tea O
and O
in O
case O
of O
migraine O
Screw O
it O
. O
Dead O
to O
the O
world O
. O
May O
your O
episodes O
be O
short O
. O
 
Do O
you O
know O
if O
the O
shaking B-DIS
stops O
, O
does O
the O
disease O
stop O
as O
well O
My O
father O
has O
Parkinson O
s O
that O
has O
turned O
into O
Alzheimer O
s. O
The O
shaking B-DIS
isn O
t O
the O
worst O
part O
of O
the O
disease O
. O
 
OP O
here O
this O
morning O
I O
forgot O
to O
take O
my O
sinemet B-DRUG
until O
9am O
and O
I O
didn O
t O
even O
notice O
until O
I O
saw O
the O
pills O
I O
had O
laid O
out O
the O
night O
before O
. O
The O
point O
being O
, O
with O
my O
previous O
does O
being O
18 O
HOURS O
earlier O
my O
sympoms O
had O
not O
come O
back O
. O
I O
was O
operating O
at O
90 O
capacity O
, O
the O
same O
as O
when O
I O
took O
my O
previous O
pills O
at O
4pm O
the O
previous O
day O
. O
What O
gives O
Anybody O
have O
thoughts O
 
The O
problem O
is O
that O
even O
that O
high O
of O
a O
dose O
of O
ritalin B-DRUG
ir I-DRUG
25 O
mg O
doesn O
t O
keep O
me O
awake O
or O
energized B-DIS
at O
all O
even O
tho O
I O
did O
feel O
the O
physical O
side O
effects O
of O
the O
drug O
mild B-DIS
hypertension I-DIS
149 O
75 O
iirc O
and O
jaw B-DIS

weird O
 
Just O

I O
need O
to O
keep O

Need O

What O

would O
the O

it O

for O
the O
potential O

lots O

Mine O
showed O
up O
initially O

this O

. O
Treatment O
options O
are O
wide O
ranged O
and O
vary O
from O
person O
to O
person O
. O
As O
Nyxi O
said O
, O
just O
know O
that O
this O
isn O
t O
some O
skin O
rash O
. O
Psoriasis B-DIS
is O
an O
auto-immune B-DIS
disease I-DIS
, O
and O
while O
it O
can O
be O
treated O
and O
sometimes O
even O
go O
into O
remission O
, O
it O
will O
always O
be O
there O
. O
Personally O
if O
its O
just O
your O
wrist O
and O
it O
s O
nothing O
much O
more O
than O
just O
annoying O
or O
unsightly O
, O
I O
would O
just O
try O
and O
hit O
it O
with O
some O
moisturizing O
stuff O
like O
coconut O
oil O
or O
OTC O
psoriasis B-DIS
creams O
and O
see O
if O
you O
can O
manage O
it O
. O
Or O
you O
could O
try O
and O
go O
the O
topical B-DRUG
steroid I-DRUG
route O
, O
just O
be O
warned O
that O
steroids O
aren O
t O
something O
you O
want O
to O
get O
in O
a O
habit O
of O
using O
all O
the O
time- O
they O
can O
have O
negative O
side O
effects O
for O
sure O
and O
require O
cycling O
to O
avoid O
them O
. O
 
Shit O
, O
I O
totally O
forgot O
I O
was O
typing O
my O
response O
while O
on O
the O
go O
, O
and O
it O
totally O
slipped O
my O
mind O
. O
Any O
hoot O
, O
from O
what O
I O
have O
read O
, O
for O
those O
without O
insurance O
it O
can O
cost O
about O
24k- O
36k O
a O
year O
. O
Then O
again O
, O
most O
, O
if O
not O
all O
, O
pf O
the O
companies O
have O
a O
co-pay O
program O
where O
you O
can O
get O
medication O
for O
something O
like O
5 O
or O
so O
. O
 
The O
clobetasol B-DRUG
works O
great O
you O
just O
need O
to O
apply O
every O
other O
day O
because O
it O
can O
thin B-DIS
your I-DIS
skin I-DIS
out I-DIS
over O
time O
. O
 
After O
nearly O
a O
year O
of O
calling O
in O
sick O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
a O
week O
and O
having O
a O
miserable O
time O
at O
work O
, O
I O
eventually O
took O
a O
year O
off O
. O
Luckily O
I O
managed O
to O
sort O
myself O
out O
during O
that O
time O
and O
am O
now O
several O
months O
into O
a O
slow O
phased O
return O
. O
 
When O
you O
look O
at O
how O
it O
works O
, O
the O
CPAP B-DRUG
is O
designed O
to O
provide O
positive O
pressure O
at O
the O
mask O
. O
While O
you O
may O
breathe O
in O
and O
out O
all O
night O
, O
the O
exhaled O
air O
is O
vented O
at O
the O
mask O
, O
and O
worst O
case O
, O
never O
makes O
it O
past O
the O
humidifier O
. O
So O
, O
if O
you O
sterilize O
the O
humidifier O
and O
pitch O
the O
filters O
, O
hose O
and O
mask O
, O
a O
CL O
CPAP O
can O
be O
a O
pretty O
safe O
product O
. O
I O
recently O
bought O
a O
CPAP O
at O
a O
thrift O
store O
for O
35 O
to O
use O
as O
a O
backup O
. O
They O
had O
it O
labeled O
as O
a O
personal O
humidifier O
. O
 
I O
m O
in O
London O
so O
if O
this O
takes O
off O
Dublin O
is O
next O
door O
. O
I O
m O
seriously O
considering O
retirement O
so O
soon O
I O
ll O
be O
able O
to O
dedicate O
time O
to O
this O
. O
 
I O
started O
with O
a O
full O
face O
mask O
beard O
sealing O
concerns O
, O
and O
while O
it O
worked O
, O
wasn O
t O
a O
fan O
, O
and O
had O
to O
force O
myself O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O
A O
buddy O
suggested O
going O
with O
a O
cloth O
nasal O
mask O
, O
and O
I O
love O
it O
I O
can O
move O
in O
my O
sleep O
, O
and O
for O
the O
most O
part O
I O
m O
good O
to O
go O
. O
Hope O
this O
helps O
 
You O
might O
want O
to O
get O
a O
chinstrap O
. O
In O
my O
experience O
4 O
5 O
people O
have O
oral B-DIS
leak I-DIS
, O
and O
if O
you O
have O
difficulty O
with O
keeping O
your O
mouth O
closed O
you O
re O
probably O
one O
of O
the O
4 O
. O
Maybe O
check O
your O
machines O
leak O
value O
, O
or O
ask O
your O
CPAP O
provider O
to O
check O
for O
you O
to O
see O
if O
it O
s O
leaking O
. O
You O
ll O
get O
a O
lot O
better O
sleep O
if O
you O
stop O
oral B-DIS
leak I-DIS
. O
 
What O
were O
you O
allergic B-DIS
to O
 
Interesting O
... O
but O
who O
knows O
Every O
body O
is O
different O
... O
and O
every O
RA B-DIS
ers O
symptoms O
and O
cures O
too O
 
Haiyan O
Zhang O
does O
respond O
to O
tweets O
. O
She O
has O
zero O
interest O
in O
manufacturing O
this O
, O
but O
if O
it O
has O
some O
other O
, O
non B-DIS
movement I-DIS
disorder I-DIS
, O
application O
she O
wants O
to O
keep O
the O
rights O
as O
prototype O
was O
built O
in O
Microsoft O
labs O
. O
So O
what O
ever O
we O
come O
up O
is O
fine O
as O
it O
will O
be O
personal O
projects O
. O
Irony O
is O
the O
best O
way O
to O
get O
it O
sold O
in O
start O
a O
kickstarter O
campaign O
, O
by O
the O
time O
it O
is O
ready O
to O
do O
, O
some O
company O
in O
Shenzhen O
will O
have O
it O
on O
eBay O
for O
10 O
. O
Sadly O
I O
am O
not O
kidding O
, O
but O
that O
would O
be O
great O
 
It O
s O
stone B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
Stone B-DIS
pain I-DIS
is O
not O
always O
10 O
10 O
. O
It O
comes O
and O
goes O
and O
the O
intensity O
varies O
. O
If O
you O
re O
worried O
about O
a O
UTI B-DIS
you O
can O
get O
home O
test O
kits O
from O
AZO B-DRUG
at O
the O
drugstore O
, O
or O
go O
see O
a O
doc O
. O
I O
ve O
often O
had O
worse O
pain B-DIS
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
in O
bed O
. O
Gravity O
is O
your O
friend O
so O
if O
you O
can O
sleep O
sitting O
up O
that O
would O
help O
. O
If O
you O
have O
a O
recliner O
try O
that O
or O
you O
can O
prop O
the O
head O
of O
your O
bed O
up O
. O
 
Hi O
again O
, O
I O
m O
the O
one O
with O
the O
60 O
lesions B-DIS
that O
responded O
earlier O
... O
..with O
the O
whole O
vitamin O
D O
stupidity O
going O
around O
, O
my O
neurologist O
wanted O
to O
check O
mine O
as O
well O
. O
Surprise O
, O
surprise O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
my O
vitamin O
D O
levels O
You O
do O
not O
have O
MS. B-DIS
Be O
fucking O
grateful O
. O
 
We O
do O
have O
an O
Rx O
. O
Thanks O
- O
 
Sometimes O
you O
just O
need O
an O
outlet O
. O
I O
feel O
you O
. O
Hope O
you O
re O
feeling O
better O
soon O
 
Thanks O
for O
your O
response O
Yeah O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
the O
symptoms O
kind O
of O
get O
a O
bit O
better O
, O
then O
the O
next O
day O
come O
back O
. O
I O
m O
going O
to O
try O
some O
of O
the O
things O
people O
mentioned O
here O
in O
the O
meantime O
until O
I O
see O
the O
ENT O
. O
I O
go O
to O
vestibular O
physio O
tomorrow O
, O
which O
I O
m O
really O
looking O
forward O
to O
, O
although O
I O
ve O
heard O
that O
it O
can O
make O
you O
feel O
a O
bit O
worse O
before O
you O
get O
better O
. O
Fingers O
crossed O
 
What O
s O
your O
weight O
Any O
issues O
besides O
that O
. O
Because O
this O
alone O
does O
not O
strike O
me O
as O
dysautonomia B-DIS
... O
if O
it O
is O
just O
this O
than O
its O
probably O
very O
mild O
due O
to O
some O
underlying O
cause O
that O
could O
very O
well O
be O
lack B-DIS
of I-DIS
sleep I-DIS
your O
sleep O
rythim O
controls O
so O
many O
hormones O
and O
when O
you O
don O
t O
sleep O
enough O
your O
body O
utilizes O
epinephrine B-DRUG
much O
more O
frequently O
than O
needed O
. O
 
will O
do O
and O
thanks O
again O
 
thanks O
, O
i O
ll O
check O
that O
out O
 
that O
s O
great O
I O
ve O
done O
dose B-DRUG
packs I-DRUG
like O
that O
when O
i O
weaned O
down O
regularly O
and O
quickly O
, O
and O
they O
were O
great O
. O
So O
glad O
you O
haven O
t O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
with O
it O
 
Doctor O
asap O
 
I O
just O
started O
5mg O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
it O
s O
been O
amazing O
I O
need O
to O
bump O
it O
to O
7.5 O
though O
. O
Pulse O
still O
hovers O
around O
100 O
sometimes O
in O
the O
evening O
. O
Which O
is O
still O
a O
huuuuge O
decrease O
from O
before O
. O
I O
have O
reynaud O
s O
and O
it O
doesn O
t O
seem O
to O
have O
had O
an O
effect O
on O
that O
at O
all O
. O
My O
feet B-DIS
are I-DIS
still I-DIS
freezing I-DIS
cold I-DIS
and I-DIS
dead I-DIS
looking I-DIS
all O
the O
time O
. O
It O
s O
gross O
. O
Sometimes O
my O
big B-DIS
toes I-DIS
hurt I-DIS
like O
right O
under O
the O
nail O
. O
It O
s O
kind O
of O
a O
pinching B-DIS
sensation I-DIS
and O
usually O
happens O
when O
I O
m O
laying O
flat O
and O
trying O
to O
sleep O
. O
Super O
annoying O
. O
I O
ve O
noticed O
I O
rarely O
get O
the O
toe B-DIS
pain I-DIS
when O
I O
ve O
taken O
Advil B-DRUG
that O
day O
. O
I O
try O
not O
to O
take O
it O
often O
though O
because O
it O
raises O
my O
already O
elevated B-DIS
blood I-DIS
pressure I-DIS
. O
Corlanor B-DRUG
has O
been O
amazing O
otherwise O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
a O
real O
person O
again O
Are O
you O
loving O
it O
other O
than O
the O
foot B-DIS
pain I-DIS
 
IC B-DIS
is O
progressive O
in O
a O
minority O
of O
patients O
. O
It O
s O
much O
more O
common O
for O
things O
to O
go O
get O
better O
over O
time O
, O
not O
worse O
, O
especially O
with O
treatment O
. O
 
Ugh O
, O
I O
do O
the O
same O
thing O
, O
but O
I O
can O
t O
deal O
with O
the O
mental B-DIS
fog I-DIS
. O
I O
have O
so O
much O
to O
do O
. O
And O
no O
I O
don O
t O
pass O
gas O
either O
way O
very O
much O
at O
all O
anymore O
. O
It O
s O
like O
nothing O
wants O
to O
come O
out O
. O
Ever O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
feel O
like O
my O
stomach O
is O
a O
jammed O
trash O
compactor O
. O
 
I O
will O
try O
this O
, O
thanks O
for O
your O
advice O
 
Disrupted O

Thank O
you O
How O
do O
I O
experiment O
with O
PEM O
About O
the O
most O
I O
do O
these O
days O
in O
under O
ten O
minutes O
of O
walking O
at O
a O
time O
and O
that O
s O
definitely O
enough O
to O
make O
me O
tired B-DIS
but O
it O
s O
also O
usually O
following O
something O
else O
e.g O
. O
Coming O
home O
from O
work O
or O
the O
shops O
rather O
than O
walking O
for O
walking O
sake O
 
I O
m O
pretty O
certain O
it O
is O
, O
though O
I O
also O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
adrenal B-DIS
insufficiency I-DIS
just O
shortly O
after O
I O
started O
my O
thyroid B-DIS
treatment O
and O
apparently O
that O
can O
cause O
an O
electrolyte B-DIS
imbalance I-DIS
which O
may O
explain O
some O
of O
the O
muscle B-DIS
issues I-DIS
as O
well O
. O
But O
yea O
, O
it O
hasn O
t O
completely O
resolved O
itself O
, O
much O
to O
my O
chagrin O
, O
but O
it O
got O
better O
. O
I O
made O
a O
comment O
on O
another O
post O
saying O
something O
akin O
to O
this O
but O
I O
ll O
say O
it O
again O
, O
I O
take O
synthroid B-DRUG
and O
cytomel B-DRUG
for O
hypo O
and O
it O
s O
taken O
me O
close O
to O
18 O
months O
to O
hone O
in O
on O
the O
goldilocks O
zone O
. O
And O
it O
s O
tough O
because O
3 O
- O
4 O
times O
now O
I O
ve O
thought O
I O
had O
it O
and O
done O
well O
for O
a O
few O
days O
, O
and O
in O
one O
instance O
, O
several O
weeks O
. O
But O
I O
always O
overrun O
it O
and O
get O
slammed O
on O
the O
hyper O
side O
primarily O
I O
just O
stop B-DIS
sleeping I-DIS
and O
then O
my O
body O
gets O
all O
messed O
up O
from O
sleep B-DIS
deprivation I-DIS
... O
.stop O
taking O
synthroid O
, O
become O
majorly O
depressed B-DIS
with O
bipolar B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
... O
.start O
at O
a O
low O
dose O
and O
begin O
titrating O
even O
slower O
... O
rinse O
... O
repeat O
... O
.fun O
stuff O
. O
But O
I O
m O
close O
to O
my O
optimal O
dose O
even O
though O
my O
labs O
have O
been O
all O
over O
the O
place O
. O
It O
just O
takes O
time O
and O
patience O
which O
I O
know O
are O
tough O
to O
come O
by O
when O
you O
re O
hypo O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O
to O
ya O
though O
. O
 
Sounds O
like O
you O
have O
a O
great O
nurse O
practitioner O
if O
they O
are O
saying O
to O
target O
70-140 O
. O
There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
smaller O
studies O
showing O
damage O
above O
that O
140 O
threshold O
. O
I O
m O
not O
aware O
of O
any O
studies O
looking O
at O
thousands O
of O
people O
. O
That O
damage O
is O
small O
and O
some O
can O
be O
repaired O
if O
you O
don O
t O
spend O
too O
long O
above O
. O
There O
s O
considerably O
more O
evidence O
that O
fat O
and O
high O
carbs O
are O
bad O
but O
that O
fat O
and O
low O
carbs O
may O
actually O
be O
good O
. O
Read O
Good O
Calories O
, O
Bad O
Calories O
by O
Gary O
Taubes O
for O
a O
detailed O
discussion O
that O
includes O
lots O
of O
research O
. O
You O
ve O
already O
figured O
out O
how O
low O
is O
low O
enough O
-- O
keep O
your O
glucose O
below O
140 O
. O
I O
got O
diagnosed O
at O
50 O
, O
and O
was O
likely O
fully O
diabetic B-DIS
for O
years O
before O
that O
. O
I O
also O
ended O
up O
on O
statins B-DRUG
because O
of O
my O
cholesterol B-DIS
. O
I O
went O
high-fat O
low O
carb O
. O
That O
included O
bacon O
and O
eggs O
, O
bacon O
cheeseburgers O
with O
lettuce O
instead O
of O
a O
bun O
, O
and O
16 O
oz O
ribeye O
steaks O
. O
For O
me O
, O
total O
carbs O
were O
40-50 O
for O
the O
day O
and O
less O
than O
15 O
at O
any O
meal O
. O
But O
that O
was O
because O
that O
s O
what O
my O
meter O
said O
. O
4 O
months O
later O
, O
my O
A1C O
was O
5.6 O
and O
they O
pulled O
me O
off O
the O
statins B-DRUG
. O
As O
to O
cheating O
, O
since O
the O
damage O
is O
so O
small O
and O
the O
results O
years O
away O
, O
I O
try O
to O
stay O
below O
140 O
. O
I O
really O
try O
to O
stay O
below O
135 O
. O
I O
ll O
get O
up O
to O
155 O
just O
once O
or O
twice O
a O
month O
when O
I O
eat O
refried O
beans O
. O
Since O
I O
eat O
bacon O
a O
few O

week O
, O
I O
can O
live O
with O
that O
. O
 
I O
usually O
do O
extra O
fingersticks O
if O
the O
bloodsugar B-DIS
seems I-DIS
abnormal I-DIS
. O
Like O
, O
if O
Dexcom B-DRUG
is O
telling O
me O
my O
BS B-DIS
is O
really O
high O
for O
seemingly O
no O
reason O
, O
I O
ll O
check O
with O
a O
glucose O
meter O
before O
I O
treat O
it O
. O
Same O
with O
abnormal B-DIS
lows I-DIS
. O
 
I O
think O
a O
lot O
of O
us O
leave O
before O
we O
can O
be O
left O
for O
fear O
of O
this O
exact O
thing O
. O
Good O
luck O
getting O
through O
this O
. O
You O
WILL O
get O
through O
this O
, O
even O
if O
it O
takes O
a O
long O
time O
 
Well O
I O
made O
an O
appointment O
with O
the O
GI O
for O
tomorrow O
so O
I O
think O
we O
will O
test O
for O
antibodies O
. O
I O
hope O
this O
isn O
t O
the O
case O
yet O
. O
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
input O
 
He O
gets O
curious O
about O
things O
and O
we O
had O
to O
get O
the O
alarm O
system O
panel O
disconnected O
he O
s O
in O
the O
master O
bedroom O
so O
he O
can O
have O
his O
own O
bathroom O
- O
so O
this O
is O
not O
the O
main O
panel O
. O
The O
last O
time O
he O
was O
starting O
to O
rummage O
in O
the O
closet O
at O
3 O
30am O
and O
got O
distracted O
with O
the O
alarm O
system O
, O
pulled O
off O
the O
index O
card O
saying O
Alarm O
system O
- O
do O
not O
touch O
that O
was O
attached O
with O
strong O
tape O
and O
started O
pressing O
buttons O
. O
That O
s O
a O
big O
problem O
- O
completely O
ignoring B-DIS
instructions I-DIS
and O
not B-DIS
recognizing I-DIS
the I-DIS
risks I-DIS
consequences B-DIS
of O
doing O
that O
. O
He O
s O
always O
had O
an O
attitude O
that O
he O
is O
not O
subject O
to O
the O
same O
rules O
as O
everyone O
else O
- O
so O
that O
makes O
me O
nervous O
- O
lighters O
and O
matches O
are O
all O
hidden O
and O
knobs O
off O
the O
stovetop O
. O
 
Thank O
you O

I O

a O

Before O
I O

my O

were I-DIS
usually I-DIS
just I-DIS
loose I-DIS
-- O
often O
the O

of O

or O
, O
I O
dunno O
, O
oatmeal O
 
Nah O
it O
s O
okay O
, O
I O
just O
appreciate O
having O
someone O
to O
talk O
it O
out O
with O
. O
 
Yes O
and O
it O
s O
like O
gasoline O
on O
a O
fire O
. O
We O
ve O
removed O
the O

And O
you O
would O
be O
wrong O
... O
Dr. O
Fung O
is O
pretty O
well O
regarded O
Although O
the O
article O
is O
about O
what O
he O
said O
and O
not O
his O
writing O
... O
So O
that O
for O
what O
it O
is O
worth O
 
She O
s O
mid-late O
stage O
. O
I O
am O
not O
a O
doctor O
, O
but O
if O
you O
re O
only O
suspecting O
, O
she O
d O
probably O
be O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
. O
My O
mother O
can O
t O
feed O
or O
clothe O
herself O
, O
tries B-DIS
eating I-DIS
things I-DIS
like I-DIS
soap I-DIS
, O
can O
t O
form O
coherent O
sentences O
and O
mumbles B-DIS
to I-DIS
herself I-DIS
incoherently I-DIS
nonstop O
. O
She O
has O
delusions B-DIS
and O
hallucinations B-DIS
, O
eg O
. O
talking B-DIS
to I-DIS
dead I-DIS
people I-DIS
, O
believing O
her O
parents O
both O
dead O
for O
over O
30 O
years O
are O
coming O
to O
pick O
her O
up O
and O
bring O
her O
back O
home O
, O
etc O
. O
I O
am O
her O
son O
but O
she O
recognizes O
me O
as O
her O
cousin O
consistently O
. O
And O
she O
isn O
t O
even O
considered O
end-late O
stage O
yet O
. O
That O
will O
happen O
afaik O
when O
she O
loses B-DIS
her I-DIS
motor I-DIS
function I-DIS
. O
 
I O
like O
it O
when O
you O
call O
me O
big O
poppa O
 
This O
is O
fantastic O
. O
I O
m O
already O
soy O
, O
gluten O
and O
dairy O
free O
but O
does O
the O
book O
say O
to O
avoid O
potatoes O
, O
rice O
, O
tomatoes O
and O
Peppers O
also O
 
As O
much O
as O
I O
hated O
to O

I O
used O
one O
after O
I O
broke B-DIS
my I-DIS
foot I-DIS
- O
I O
fell O
in O
the O
shower O
- O
and O
it O
helped O
a O
lot O
with O
my O
foot O
and O
balance B-DIS
. O
I O
still O
use O
it O
when O
I O
m O

a O
bad B-DIS
balance I-DIS
day O
. O
 
r O

this O
thread O
, O
to O
be O
exact O

so O
for O
the O
sensors O
, O
what O
happens O
that O
you O
need O
to O
change O
them O
they O
die O
, O
fall O
off O
lose O
signal O
or O
what O
 
You O
re O
handling O
and O
assessing O
your O
emotions O
very O
clearly O
and O
maturely O
and O
seeing O
them O
for O
what O
they O
are O
. O
I O
sense O
that O
you O
question O
why O
these O
painful B-DIS
emotions I-DIS
exist O
if O
on O
the O
surface O
you O
have O
a O
good O
life O
. O
Sometimes O
life O
takes O
us O
to O
a O
deep O
dark O
place O
that O
no O
one O
reach O
. O
I O
think O
deep O
down O
, O
everyone O
questions O
their O
existence O
at O
some O
point O
no O
matter O
if O
life O
is O
easy O
for O
them O
or O
hard O
. O
Your O
analogy O
to O
a O
pencil O
being O
sharpened O
then O
dulled O
is O
very O
relative O
what O
my O
depression B-DIS
feels O
like O
sometimes O
. O
Like O
there O
s O
a O
high O
sharp O
point O
when O
I O
m O
reenergized O
to O
socialize O
then O
I O
feel O
my O
energy B-DIS
deplete I-DIS
to O
the O
point O
of O
wanting O
to O
be O
alone O
and O
sad B-DIS
. O
Do O
you O
think O
that O
we O
are O
here O
to O
serve O
a O
purpose O
and O
that O
we O
just O
haven O
t O
found O

However O
, O
the O

It O
s O
been O
3 O
years O
with O
my O
current O
psych O
doc O
, O
and O
just O
recently O
through O
group O
therapy O
I O
realized O
I O
ve O
had O
textbook O
DSM-V B-DIS
hypomanic I-DIS
episodes O
. O
And O
SSRIs B-DRUG
SNRIs B-DRUG
don O

work O
for O

And O
STILL O
I O
have O
no O
clue O
if O
I O
m O
just O
depressed B-DIS
or O
have O
BPII B-DIS
. O
Just O
sucks O
that O
I O
had O
to O
basically O
take O
every O
single O
SSRI B-DRUG
SNRI B-DRUG
for O
years O
and O
have O
a O
huge B-DIS
breakdown I-DIS
before O
he O
even O
considered O
an O
alternate O

. O
Sorry O
for O
the O
rant O
, O
just O
something O
that O
frustrates O
me O
. O
 
I O
m O
sorry O
, O
there O
was O
a O
typo O
in O
my O
comment O
which O
made O
it O
confusing O
. O
I O
ll O
clarify O
what O
I O
meant O
I O
recently O
gave O
up O
alcohol O
to O
be O
mentally O
and O
physically O
healthier O
. O
I O
was O
asking O
people O
with O
experience O
using O
cannabis B-DRUG
to O
help O
ease O
symptoms O
like O
splitting B-DIS
, O
because O
I O
noticed O
it O
did O
for O
me O
but O
I O
ve O
only O
used O
it O
twice O
and O
was O
looking O
for O
some O
more O
data O
. O
I O
don O
t O
and O
wouldn O
t O
use O
any O
OTHER O
drug O
, O
as O
in O
LSD B-DRUG
. O
But O
I O
didn O
t O
type O
the O
word O
other O
which O
is O
why O
it O
was O
confusing O
. O
 
I O
forgot O
about O
this O
post O
, O
but O
what O
do O
you O
mean O
 
I O
hadn O
t O
heard O
of O
this O
before O
, O
does O
this O
actually O
help O
people O
 
Undiagnosed O
, O
this O
is O
so O
unbelievably O
how O
I O
am O
. O
I O
relate O
to O
this O
on O
everything O
except O
the O
fact O
you O
do O
it O
alone O
amp O
; O
self O
control O
. O
I O
split O
way O
faster O
with O
romantic O
partners O
too O
. O
 
I O
suppose O
you O
ll O
have O
to O
go O
through O
therapy O
to O
distinguish O
your O
current O
ambiguous O
feelings O
from O
a O
more O
concrete O
assessment O
to O
come O
to O
the O
property O
results O
. O
Butt O
, O
I O
think O
you O
know O
when O
you O
feel O
it O
experience O
it O
. O
Inn O
every O
relationship O
, O
there O
s O
going O
to O
be O
battles O
and O
trials O
. O
I O
think O
a O
more O
healthy O
bpd O
relationship O
has O
proper O
coping O
mechanisms O
, O
of O
course O
a O
better O
, O
healthy O
rapport O
. O
While O
in O

, O

your O
transition O
; O
and O
you O
should O
know O
. O
 
Yeah O
, O
I O
noticed O
that O
too O
. O
I O
seriously O
doubt O
I O
can O
change O
that O
person O

mind O
. O
However O
, O
since O
this O

remain O
online O

there O
is O
a O
slight O
chance O
someone O
else O
might O

it O

, O
I O
thought O
it O
s O
good O
to O

some O

I O
hope O
you O
can O
find O
a O
doctor O
you O
like O
, O
and O
who O
respects O
you O

it O
makes O
such O
a O
difference O
I O
hope O
you O
get O
that O

the O

I O
would O
suspect O

people O
I O
don O

well O

I O
often O
just O

Its O
easier O
sometimes O
to O
have O
people O
think O
I O
m O
a O
flaky O

go O

I O
have O
an O

some O

still O
treat O

some O
kind O

sometimes O
I O
often O
dont O
want O
to O
identify O
myself O
as O
being O
ill O
or O
disabled O
in O
some O
way O

But O
then O
i O
had O
20 O
years O
symptoms O
on O

off O
without O

so O
i O
got O
used O

it O
can O
also O
help O

who O
appear O
even O
lazier O

yourself O

I O
guess O
all O
this O
is O
dysfunctional O

who O
wants O
to O
identify O
as O

nobody O

. O
I O
m O
starting O
inflectra B-DRUG
in O
a O
few O
days O
so O
hopefully O
that O
helps O
with O
nausea B-DIS
n I-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
which O
I O
think O
is O
the O
primary O
reason O
for O
my O
lack B-DIS
of I-DIS
appetite I-DIS
. O
 
Please O
see O
my O
reply O
on O
this O
thread O
 
I O
can O
t O
afford O
to O
prick O
my O
fingers O
every O
time O
I O
need O
to O
check O
my O
BG O
- O
I O
have O
to O
watch O
the O
strip O
count O
. O
I O
m O
still O
waiting O
for O
my O
50 O
bucks O
worth O
of O
an O
Amazon O
purchase O
of O
Verio O
One O
Touch O
strips O
that O
was O
done O
two O
weeks O
ago O
. O
My O
insurance O
only O
takes O
off O
30 O
bucks O
for O
the O
total O
cost O
and O
I O
m O
still O
screwed O
with O
130 O
dollars O
for O
purchasing O
the O
damn O
strips O
. O
So O
the O
answer O
is O
no O
I O
don O
t. O
I O
won O
t O
get O
my O
AC1 O
for O
another O
3 O
months O
. O
 
I O
believe O
in O
PA O
you O
can O
get O
canabis B-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
. O
It O
has O
most O
if O
not O
all O
the O
THC B-DRUG
removed O
. O
 
wow O
that O
s O
sad O
. O
I O
would O
have O
thought O
a O
patient O
has O
a O
right O
to O
a O
copy O
of O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
their O
medical O
history O
and O
conditions O
. O
I O
ve O
only O
just O
started O
collecting O
relevant O
stuff O
in O
the O
hope O
it O
ll O
help O
the O
specialist O
, O
I O
haven O
t O
really O
been O
met O
with O
any O
resistance O
, O
though O
I O
wouldn O
t O
go O
to O
the O
EDs O
I O
ve O
presented O
to O
for O
files O
or O
results O
, O
I O
could O
see O
them O
giving O
some O
sort O
of O
resistance O
. O
Luckily O
I O
don O
t O
really O
see O
any O
value O
in O
their O
notes O
. O
 
I O
don O
t O
even O
expect O
or O
want O
that O
anymore O
, O
plus O
i O
ve O
mostly O
isolated B-DIS
myself O
after O
my O
close O
friend O
killed O
herself O
last O
year O
. O
i O
rarely O
, O
rarely O
get O
some O
breakthrough O
good O
feelings O
from O
seeing O
the O
kids O
that O
we O
help O
, O
or O
from O
making O
someone O
else O
excited O
about O
what O
we O
do O
. O
but O
after O
3 O
years O
of O
high B-DIS
stress I-DIS
and O
low B-DIS
self-care I-DIS
, O
i O
am O
just O
dragging O
myself O
along O
at O
this O
point O
. O
however O
, O
i O
don O
t O
want O
to O
do O
anything O
else O
. O
i O
don O
t O
want O
to O
do O
anything O
anymore O
-- O
withdrawing B-DIS
, O
that O
i O
used O
to O
like O
, O
feels O
like O
being O
a O
prisoner O
, O
but O
my O
anhedonia B-DIS
means O
i O
m O
not B-DIS
motivated I-DIS
to O
do O
anything O
else O
either O
. O
the O
emptiness B-DIS
has O
grown O
howlingly O
enormous O
. O
 
that O
s O
what O
s O
holding O
me O
back O
too O
. O
i O
don O
t O
know O
if O
all O
this O
pressure O
to O
help O
people O
will O
help O
me O
or O
destroy O
me O
. O
i O
go O
through O
moods O
where O
yes O
it O
s O
something O
i O
want O
to O
do O
and O
then O
i O
want O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
it O
bc O
i O
want O
a O
break O
. O
i O
really O
hope O
what O
i O
chose O
is O
the O
best O
for O
me O
. O
 
I O
m O
not O
speaking O
to O
you O
as O
a O
mod O
, O
just O
as O
a O
user O
. O
If O
the O
mod O
team O
decides O
to O
take O
issue O
with O
something O
the O
post O
will O
be O
flagged O
with O
the O
mod O
tag O
. O
No O
one O
has O
ever O
moderated O
anything O
you O
ve O
posted O
here O
to O
my O
knowledge O
, O
just O
disagreed O
with O
it O
. O
In O
the O
case O
of O
your O
first O
comment O
, O
I O
think O
the O
number O
of O
down O
votes O
should O
indicate O
that O
it O
was O
not O
at O
all O
clear O
you O
were O
being O
tongue O
in O
cheek O
and O
your O
comment O
from O
moments O
ago O
where O
you O
said O
you O
personally O
take O
this O
stuff O
seriously- O
uh O
, O
which O
is O
it O
Are O
you O
concerned O
or O
joking O
around O
I O
think O
your O
intended O
message O
didn O
t O
come O
through O
. O
My O
issue O
with O
your O
second O
comment O
is O
that O
saying O
something O
like O
pregnancy B-DIS
is O
contraindicated O
for O
IC B-DIS
and O
then O
giving O
an O
explanation O
that O
sounds O
scientific O
but O
isn O
t O
actually O
supported O
by O
the O
literature O
is O
that O
it O
can O
make O
other O
people O
who O
search O
this O
forum O
for O
answers O
think O
that O
they O
shouldn O
t O
get O
pregnant O
if O
they O
have O
IC B-DIS
. O
We O
see O
firsthand O
every O
day O
how O
misinformation O
spreads O
easily O
in O
a O
vulnerable O
patient O
population O
and O
it O
can O
take O
years O
for O
people O
to O
correct O
mistakes O
that O
they O
learn O
online O
. O
So O
when O
I O
see O
stuff O
like O
that O
, O
I O
comment O
on O
it O
and O
correct O
it O
wherever O
possible O
. O
You O
are O
welcome O
to O
your O
opinions O
but O
this O
is O
a O
discussion O
forum O
, O
people O
are O
going O
to O
comment O
and O
disagree O
with O
you O
from O
time O
to O
time O
. O
 
I O
concur O
, O
betahistine B-DRUG
seems O
to O
be O
very O
hit O
or O
miss O
. O
For O
some O
people O
it O
works O
wonders O
, O
others O
experience O
no O
effect O
at O
all O
. O
It O
doesn O
t O
do O
anything O
for O
me O
personally O
, O
but O
its O
worth O
a O
shot O
at O
trying O
, O
who O
knows O
right O
 
Regarding O
relief O
after O
urinating O
- O
that O
s O
not O
always O
the O
case O
with O
IC B-DIS
patients O
, O
as O
in O
many O
cases O
the O
cystitis B-DIS
is O
also O
accompanied O
by O
urethritis B-DIS
i.e O
urinating O
makes O
things O
worse O
, O
provided O
the O
urine O
doesn O
t O
contain O
an O
antacid B-DRUG
or O
AZO B-DRUG
. O
IMO O
there O
is O
always O
a O
place O
for O
STI B-DIS
testing O
- O
even O
in O
the O
case O
of O
non O
sexually O
active O
and O
monogamous O
folks O
. O
Better O
to O
be O
sure O
than O
not O
- O
some O
people O
are O
uncomfortable O
about O
it O
, O
but O
it O
s O
important O
to O
rule O
those O
out O
as O
possible O
causes O
. O
For O
those O
who O
are O
not O
currently O
sexually O
active O
, O
it O
is O
unlikely O
they O
had O
tests O
within O
the O
3-4 O
month O
window O
after O
the O
last O
time O
they O
had O
sex O
, O
so O
there O
is O
still O
going O
to O
be O
uncertainty O
. O
 
I O
m O
not O
a O
mod O
, O
but O
there O
is O
certainly O
a O
lot O
of O
strong O
emotions O
around O
dementia B-DIS
. O
My O
grandmother O
and O
my O
step O
father O
are O
both O
in O
different O
stages O
of O
Alzheimer O
s O
, O
and O
I O
ve O
gone O
through O
the O
whole O
gamut O
- O
including O
perplexing B-DIS
behavior I-DIS
by O
other O
family O
members O
. O
I O
think O
you O
should O
be O
free O
to O
vent O
. O
Maybe O
some O
of O
us O
here O
have O
been O
in O
similar O
situations O
, O
and O
may O
be O
able O
to O
offer O
advice O
, O
or O
at O
least O
just O
a O
listening O
ear O
. O
 
Me O
too O
. O
I O
would O
like O
to O
keep O
a O
gun O
in O
a O
vault O
next O
to O
a O
bottle O
of O
wine O
, O
so O
if O
anything O
happens O
like O
cancer B-DIS
or O
I O
m O
to O
old O
to O
work O
, O
then O
I O
ll O
just O
say O
good O
bye O
. O
I O
don O
t O
except O
myself O
to O
die O
shitting O
in O
a O
bed O
. O
 
I O
was O
on O
Allegra B-DRUG
before O
Zyrtec B-DRUG
. O
It O
worked O
for O
a O
while O
but O
then O
stopped O
working O
. O
 
I O
m O
on O
a O
7 O
year O
journey O
to O
diagnose O
my O
stunning O
exhaustion B-DIS
, O
insomnia B-DIS
, O
heart B-DIS
palpitations I-DIS

etc O
. O
I O
ve O
seen O
neurologists O
, O
endocrinologists O

sleep O
specialists O
, O
everything O

I O
ve O
had O
MRIs O
, O
sleep O
studies O
many O
many O
different O
types O
... O
you O
get O
the O
point O
. O
this O
post O
was O
the O
most O
dead-on O
, O
accurate O
description O
of O
my O
symptoms O
ive O
ever O
read O
, O
and O
im O
showing O
this O
to O
my O
doctor O
immediately O
. O
THANK O
YOU O
 
Cauliflower O
Before O
I O
d O
figured O
out O
how O
to O
eat O
for O
GP B-DIS
I O
tried O
to O
trick O
my O
stomach O
by O
ricing O
cauliflower O
to O
serve O
as O
mashed O
potatoes O
in O
a O
meal O
, O
and O
that O
was O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
nights O
ever O
. O
I O
know O
better O
now O
, O
thank O
goodness O
. O
 
Yep O
Less O
depression B-DIS
amp O
; O
muscle B-DIS
cramps I-DIS
more B-DIS
energy I-DIS
. O
Only O
remaining O
issue O
is O
the O
Hashi B-DIS
haze I-DIS
for O
me O
. O
Also O
, O
be O
careful O
not O
to O
be O
overprescribed O
Sythroid B-DRUG
. O
Doctor O
threw O
me O
waaay O
into O
hyPER B-DIS
thyroid I-DIS
symptom-land O
by O
quickly O
escalating O
dosages O
. O
May O
be O
hard O
to O
imagine O
; O
but O
I O
think O
the O
artificial O
hyPER O
range O
was O
worse O
. O
Anxiety B-DIS
attacks I-DIS
, O
feeling B-DIS
of I-DIS
rapid I-DIS
heart I-DIS
, O
etc O
. O
Not O
fun O
at O
all O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O
 
As O
far O
as O
the O
breathing O
, O
it O
s O
the O
only O
autonomic O
function O
we O
can O
voluntarily O
control O
. O
And O
once O
you O
start O
paying O
attention O
to O
it O
, O
it O
s O
very O
hard O
not O
to O
analyze O
every O
second O
of O
it O
. O
Try O
practicing O
mindfulness O
meditation O
. O
 
What O
condition O
does O
he O
she O
have O
and O
how O
many O
courses O
were O
done O
Thanks O
so O
much O
. O
 
Have O
you O
heard O
of O
people O
taking O
it O
at O
night O
I O
m O
just O
starving O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
I O
don O
t O
walk O
the O
calcium O
from O
my O
coffee O
creamer O
interfering O
 
Feel O
you O
. O
I O
have O
a O
clear O
wish O
to O
achieve O
and O
the O
best O
thing O
about O
it O
is O
that O
I O
can O
just O
do O
it O
. O
I O
could O
. O
But O
... O
you O
know O
. O
I O
m O
a O
stupid O
. O
Damn O
. O
It O
hurts O
. O
Especially O
the O
times O
you O
actually O
think O
you O
have O
the O
energy O
to O
do O
it O
, O
and O
you O
do O
- O
for O
a O
short O
time O
. O
And O
then O
- O
bang O
. O
 
Ya O
I O
barely O
have O
any O
gas B-DIS
at O
all O
, O
could O
many O
factors O
some O
people O
naturally O
are O
more O
gassy B-DIS
than O
others O
and O
of O
course O
what O
you O
eat O
plays O
a O
huge O
factor O
. O
Are O
you O
adjusting O
your O
diet O
 
At O
this O
point O
, O
totally O
willing O
to O
accept O
the O
overlord O
. O
My O
floors O
would O
be O
spotless O
 
Removed O
, O
rule O
4 O
. O
 
Yeah O
, O
I O
was O
thinking O
like O
that O
. O
But O
it O
s O
a O
good O
point O
that O
after O
a O
few O
times O
the O
list O
is O
probably O
unnecessary O
. O
 
I O
m O
also O
literally O
commuting O
between O
states O
to O
support O
my O
parents O
and O
keep O
my O
current O
job O
 
I O
ll O
definitely O
discuss O
her O
medication O
with O
my O
mother O
so O
she O
can O
talk O
to O
her O
doctor O
about O
it O
. O
Her O
routine O
has O
really O
changed O
and O
it O
s O
been O
hard O
to O
get O
a O
new O
one O
established O
with O
my O
grandpa O
bouncing O
around O
. O
We O
try O
to O
take O
her O
to O
visit O
him O
3-4 O
times O
a O
week O
as O
it O
s O
nearly O
an O
hour O
drive O
to O
the O
rehab O
he O
s O
in O
. O
Thanks O
 
Thanks O
, O
let O
me O
know O
how O
that O
goes O
as O
well O
. O
I O
m O
also O
trying O
to O
get O
away O
from O
bad O
exhaustion B-DIS
and O
brain B-DIS
fog I-DIS
. O
I O
ve O
tried O
ashwaganda B-DRUG
, O
Holy O
basil O
, O
and O
a O
iodine B-DRUG
supplement I-DRUG
and O
didn O
t O
notice O
anything O
dramatic O
. O
 
The O
relationship O
I O
was O
in O
at O
the O
time O
actually O
ended O
because O
of O
it O
. O
The O
other O
relationships O
after O
that O
, O
I O
ve O
been O
upfront O
about O
it O
and O
nobody O
has O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
it O
. O
Potentially O
because O
I O
don O
t O
have O
too O
many O
issues O
fortunately O
, O
but O
it O
never O
caused O
trouble O
. O
I O
think O
most O
people O
are O
rather O
understanding O
about O
it O
, O
and O
the O
ones O
who O
aren O
t O
, O
either O
are O
not O
mature O
enough O
, O
or O
are O
just O
flat O
out O
jerks O
. O
It O
s O
probably O
best O
to O
discuss O
it O
with O
her O
, O
she O
might O
be O
thinking O
it O
s O
way O
worse O
than O
it O
actually O
is O
. O
 
I O
enjoy O
food O
prep O
but O
I O
sit O
to O
conserve O
energy O
. O
Shaving O
is O
definitely O
a O
more O
precarious O
activity O
now O
. O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
look O
at O
that O
as O
a O
possible O
solution O
but O
I O
have O
a O
shower O
chair O
if O
I O
can O
t O
swing O
the O
financial O
end O
of O
it O
. O
And O
I O
ve O
had O
the O
same O
change O
of O
opinion O
about O
the O
Roomba O
. O
 
Super O
hugs O
 
Oh O
yeah O
, O
I O
m O
totally O
at O
that O
point O
at O
the O
moment O
. O
 
I O
think O
growing O
up O
a O
diabetic B-DIS
you O
just O
develop O
a O
good O
sense O
of O
your O
body O
and O
learn O
to O
listen O
to O
it O
. O
Everybody O
s O
different O
, O
but O
I O
generally O
don O
t O
like O
to O
run O
so O
close O
to O
being O
low O
that O
even O
a O
small O
amount O
of O
physical O
exertion O
can O
drop O
me O
into O
hypoglycemia B-DIS
. O
I O
mean O
, O
it O
happens O
. O
The O
other O
day O
my O
fiancee O
and O
I O
were O
walking O
in O
a O
park O
and O
that O
was O
enough O
to O
bring O
me O
down O
despite O
a O
temp O
basal O
. O
But O
to O
be O
honest O
... O
even O
... O
passionate O
sex O
isn O
t O
as O
energetic O
or O
calorie O
draining O
as O
you O
might O
imagine O
. O
This O
is O
an O
article O
talking O
about O
that O
. O
Walking O
in O
that O
park O
, O
up O
and O
down O
steep O
hills O
, O
probably O
burned O
more O
energy O
than O
sex O
does O
. O
 
Np O
. O
Flares B-DIS
also O
make O
me O
really O
horny O
so O
it O
s O
a O
double O
edge O
sword O
, O
there O
s O
no O
escape O
lol O
 
I O
m O
not O
diagnosed O
formally O
but O
it O
s O
been O
discussed O
. O
I O
m O
not O
a O
compulsive B-DIS
liar I-DIS
, O
and O
I O
don O
t O
believe O
BPD B-DIS
means O
that O
someone O
is O
either O
. O
Sounds O
like O
OP B-DIS
had O
BPD B-DIS
mixed O
up O
with O
another O
personality B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
that O
is O
often O
confused O
for O
BPD B-DIS
. O
In O
fact O
I O
hate O
liars O
and O
have O
major O
trust B-DIS
issues I-DIS
because O
of O
being O
lied O
to O
in O
my O
life O
. O
 
Negative O
. O
Although O
the O
dysautonomia B-DIS
could O
affect O
how O
one O
handles O
stress O
and O
possibly O
make O
them O
susceptible O
to O
PTSD B-DIS
Just O
a O
thought O
. O
 
I O
ve O
had O
it O
bad O
like O
you O
as O
well O
where O
no O
matter O
what O
I O
eat O
bugs O
my O
stomach O
horribly O
I O
know O
I O
need O
to O
eat O
though O
so O
I O
force O
myself O
to O
eat O
quickly O
so O
I O
don O
t O
drag O
the O
pain B-DIS
out O
over O
a O
longer O
period O
of O
time O
. O
Normally O
once O
I O
get O
the O
meal O
down O
my O
stomach B-DIS
will I-DIS
be I-DIS
horribly I-DIS
upset I-DIS
for O
about O
an O
hour O
then O
after O
it O
still O
hurts B-DIS
but O
is O
manageable O
. O
I O
also O
down O
it O
with O
lots O
of O
water O
and O
that O
seems O
to O
help O
. O
Hot O
baths O
really O
help O
me O
cope O
with O
it O
I O
just O
sit O
in O
the O
tub O
and O
relax O
. O
Also O
try O
not O
to O
let O
it O
get O
you O
down O
it O
doesn O
t O
help O
at O
all O
being O
depressed B-DIS
along O
with O
your O
ibs B-DIS
. O
Just O
accept O
it O
and O
soon O
you O
will O
be O
better O
. O
Stress O
is O
a O
huge O
factor O
in O
Ibs B-DIS
so O
it O
will O
make O
it O
harder O
for O
you O
to O
get O
better O
while O
stressing B-DIS
about O
being O
sick B-DIS
. O
Relax O
light O
a O
nice O
candle O
and O
visualize O
yourself O
getting O
better O
. O
I O
know O
it O
sounds O
like O
bullshit O
I O
thought O
so O
too O
at O
first O
but O
positive O
thinking O
has O
helped O
a O
lot O
 
Yeah O
. O
After O
I O
lose O
control O
of O
my O
emotions O
I O
always O
feel O
terrible O
. O
After O
I O
calm O
down O
I O
m O
just O
like O
what O
the O
fuck O
is O
wrong O
with O
me O
why O
do O
i O
always O
have O
to O
do O
this O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O
But O
it O
is O
who O
I O
am O
. O
I O
try O
really O
hard O
to O
hang O
on O
and O
not O
over-react O
to O
things O
or O
let O
the O
bad O
thoughts O
in O
my O
mind O
completely O
overwhelm O
me O
, O
but O
it O
s O
not O
always O
possible O
. O
We O
have O
strong O
feelings O
and O
sometimes O
they O
NEED O
to O
be O
expressed O
. O
Telling O
someone O
who O
is O
crying O
to O
calm O
down O
stop O
overreacting O
is O
a O
shitty O
way O
to O
deal O
with O
something O
imo O
. O
 
Good O
to O
know O
Thanks O
for O
all O
your O
help O
 
Call O
the O
police O
if O
the O
Director O
of O
the O
AL O
doesn O
t O
handle O
it O
IMMEDIATELY O
next O
time O
. O
I O
have O
a O
loved O
one O
with O
dementia B-DIS
, O
and O
I O
absolutely O
understand O
the O
challenges O
that O
come O
with O
it O
. O
It O
s O
one O
thing O
to O
help O
children O
understand O
and O
learn O
compassion O
. O
It O
s O
another O
for O
their O
physical O
safety O
and O
emotional O
well O
being O
to O
be O
in O
jeopardy O
. O
This O
is O
not O
only O
a O
huge O
liability O
for O
you O
, O
but O
it O
s O
hugely O
unfair O
to O
the O
children O
. O
That O
honestly O
sounds O
traumatizing O
. O
 
You O
might O
try O
calling O
your O
doctor O
and O
ask O
if O
you O
can O
try O
a O
prednisone B-DRUG
taper I-DRUG
60,50,40,30,20,10 O
. O
 
Crohn O
s O
sucks O
. O
Being O
poor O
on O
Crohn O
s O
must O
suck O
more O
. O
There O
isn O
t O
much O
you O
are O
going O
to O
be O
able O
to O
do O
to O
help O
your O
disease O
without O
proper O
medical O
care O
and O
eating O
right O
. O
At O
least O
you O
aren O
t O
alone O
- O
sounds O
like O
you O
have O
a O
spouse O
. O
So O
things O
could O
be O
worse O
. O
Your O
best O
bet O
is O
to O
try O
to O
learn O
a O
new O
skill O
at O
home O
and O
get O
a O
better O
job O
. O
A O
good O
job O
would O
come O
with O
medical O
benefits O
. O
That O
won O
t O
help O
you O
in O
the O
short O
term O
but O
would O
be O
beneficial O
in O
the O
long O
term O
. O
Good O
medical O
care O
can O
also O
help O
you O
hang O
on O
to O
your O
new O
job O
. O
I O
get O
top O
of O
the O
line O
medical O
care O
through O
my O
job O
and O
my O
crohn O
s O
is O
largely O
in O
remission O
. O
It O
s O
been O
that O
way O
for O
a O
while O
. O
So O
there O
is O
hope O
for O
you O
. O
 
Ahhh O
ok O
it O
may O
be O
the O
probiotics B-DRUG
then O
 
My O
Cleveland O
Clinic O
cardiac O
rehab O
team O
told O
me O
to O
get O
a O
Polar O
, O
and O
warned O
against O
Apple O
and O
Fitbits O
. O
But O
comparing O
the O
Polar O
to O
the O
Fitbit O
, O
there O
s O
no O
difference O
. O
Only O
thing O
with O
the O
Fitbit O
is O
you O
can O
t O
really O
see O
it O
on O
your O
daily O
chart O
because O
it O
takes O
it O
ever O
5 O
minutes O
, O
not O
constantly O
. O
How O
does O
the O
Apple O
Watch O
do O
in O
that O
regard O
 
Did O
you O
get O
any O
better O
when O
you O
started O
 
Hopefully O
this O
answers O
your O
question O
. O
I O
am O
on O
a O
dose O
of O
88 O
mcg O
but O
I O
have O
old O
75 O
mcg O
pills O
. O
My O
doctor O
had O
me O
using O
the O
75 O
mcg O
pills O
every O
weekday O
and O
then O
a O
pill O
a O
half O
a O
pill O
on O
the O
weekends O
before O
she O
upped O
me O
to O
a O
higher O
dosed O
single O
pill O
. O
I O
m O
still O
going O
through O
my O
leftover O
75s O
so O
I O
intersperse O
half O
pills O
and O
sometimes O
if O
I O
m O
lazy O
I O
take O
a O
double O
dose O
since O
I O
know O
my O
levels O
are O
running O
high O
since O
my O
last O
blood O
work O
showed O
that O
. O
So O
, O
if O
your O
dose O
set O
by O
your O
doctor O
is O
a O
certain O
number O
, O
yes O
, O
you O
may O
split O
pills O
or O
in O
your O
case O
, O
use O
two O
different O
dosages O
of O
pills O
to O
satisfy O
the O
dose O
. O
If O
you O
are O
consistent O
the O
changes O
in O
your O
levels O
will O
take O
place O
gradually O
over O
time O
. O
 
This O
does O
make O
me O
feel O
better O
Thanks O
for O
sharing O
. O
I O
recently O
started O
to O
eat O
a O
square O
of O
chocolate O
when O
I O
feel O
the O
urge O
coming O
and O
it O
actually O
seemed O
to O
help O
better O
than O
water O
. O
Maybe O
I O
m O
crazy O
but O
it O
s O
worth O
a O
shot O
lol O
 
There O
s O
also O
the O
whole O
sterility B-DIS
thing O
too O
, O
which O
I O
d O
be O
mildly O
worried O
about O
. O
 
I O
think O
it O
depends O
on O
your O
stage O
of O
GP B-DIS
. O
I O
am O
currently O
working O
in O
an O
office O
. O
But O
my O
superiors O
know O
that O
I O
leave O
sometimes O
because O
the O
nausea B-DIS
just O
becomes O
to O
much O
. O
I O
get O
it O
in O
waves O
. O
I O
have O
good O
days O
and O
bad O
days O
. O
 
I O
would O
agree O
. O
All O
they O
do O
is O
make O
my O
butt O
feel O
minty O
. O
If O
that O
s O
even O
a O
thing O
 
Your O
welcome O
. O
Neuropsychological O
assessment O
was O
required O
by O
my O
MDS B-DIS
before O
I O
had O
Deep O
Brain O
Stimulation O
DBS O
Surgery O
. O
It O
was O
interesting O
, O
but O
I O
didn O
t O
know O
the O
name O
of O
a O
Pelican O
. O
You O
look O
at O
a O
picture O
, O
and O
I O
could O
not O
recall O
Pelican O
. O
I O
knew O
what O
is O
was O
, O
but O
not O
its O
name O
. O
Ditto O
for O
Governor O
of O
Texas O
guy O
in O
a O
wheel O
chair O
, O
knew O
who O
he O
was O
, O
but O
couldn O
t O
recall O
his O
name O
and O
VP O
at O
the O
time O
Biden O
. O
Both O
came O
to O
me O
later O
in O
the O
day O
i.e O
. O
not O
Dementia B-DIS
, O
but O
cognitive B-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O
 
Eh O
, O
I O
don O
t O
really O
mind O
the O
go O
see O
a O
doctor O
advice O
. O
I O
already O
had O
a O
check O
up O
booked O
for O
this O
week O
. O
I O
mainly O
just O
posted O
this O
to O
vent O
so O
I O
appreciate O
any O
comments O
or O
feedback O
anyway O
. O
That O
said O
, O
in O
the O
past O
my O
blood O
work O
has O
usually O
been O
okay O
so O
I O
m O
inclined O
to O
believe O
my O
fatigue B-DIS
is O
mainly O
due O
to O
depression B-DIS
, O
but O
who O
knows O
. O
Body O
chemistry O
can O
be O
dumb O
. O
 
Eek O
, O
that O
s O
no O
bueno O
... O
what O
CGM O
are O
you O
using O
 
We O
have O
apparently O
had O
different O
experiences O
. O
After O
unsuccessfully O
seeing O
a O
number O
of O
other O
professionals O
, O
I O
now O
regularly O
see O
a O
specialist O
at O
Johns O
Hopkins O
and O
am O
confident O
that O
he O
is O
providing O
me O
with O
accurate O
information O
. O
I O
can O
tell O
you O
want O
to O
help O
people O
out O
and O
have O
done O
a O
lot O
of O
research O
but O
it O
s O
probably O
not O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
give O
medical O
advice O
that O
s O
counter O
to O
people O
s O
experience O
or O
doctors O
advice O
, O
especially O
with O
such O
a O
personal O
medical O
condition O
. O
 
gt O
; O
it O
s O
not O
a O
very O
sexy O
condition O
for O
doctors O
Seems O
like O
an O
inappropriate O
and O
distasteful O
thing O
for O
a O
healthcare O
professional O
to O
say O
. O
 
I O
will O
try O
drinking O
more O
water O
but O
I O
doubt O
it O
will O
help O
. O
 
I O
would O
throw O
away O
everything O
I O
own O
for O
a O
last O
hug O
man O
. O
 
I O
d O
recommend O
doing O
another O
lot O
of O
urine O
culture O
, O
but O
analyzed O
in O
a O
different O
lab O
. O
Try O
to O
not O
drink O
too O
much O
water O
before O
getting O
the O
sample O
i.e O
so O
it O
is O
slightly O
concentrated O
. O
Does O
the O
urine O
have O
a O
cloudy O
appearance O
or O
unusual O
odour O
as O
it O
does O
when O
you O
had O
the O
positive O
culture O
for O
cystitis B-DIS
before O
Did O
the O
sample O
you O
sent O
off O
that O
showed O
nothing O
have O
white O
blood O
cells O
leucocytes O
, O
WBC O
or O
polymorphs O
in O
it O
in O
the O
report O
you O
got O
from O
the O
doc O
The O
other O
thing O
I O
can O
think O
of O
is O
kidney B-DIS
stones I-DIS
. O
Bactrim B-DRUG
has O
been O
reported O
to O
cause O
those O
in O
some O
people O
. O
Ultrasound O
may O
not O
be O
detailed O
enough O
to O
tell O
, O
if O
they O
are O
small O
. O
A O
CT O
scan O
with O
contrast O
would O
more O
accurately O
confirm O
or O
rule O
them O
out O
though O
. O
It O
may O
be O
worthwhile O
to O
ask O
about O
next O
time O
you O
see O
your O
doctor O
 
Not O
a O
resting B-DIS
tremor I-DIS
in O
my O
book O
. O
Intention B-DIS
tremor I-DIS
perhaps O
As O
my O
doctor O
would O
say O
If O
you O
don O
t O
like O
how O
your O
finger B-DIS
twitches I-DIS
when O
you O
put O
it O
in O
that O
position O
, O
don O
t O
put O
it O
in O
that O
position O
. O
 
Nothing O
you O
ingest O
has O
ever O
been O
scientifically O
proven O
to O
reduce O
or O
dissolve O
calcium B-DIS
oxalate I-DIS
stones I-DIS
. O
 
Thanks O
for O
the O
info O
They O
are O
doing O
pretty O
well O
for O
me O
, O
and O
thankfully O
I O
very O
rarely O
have O
major O
leakage B-DIS
 
I O
was O
gon O
na O
mention O
the O
syrup O
may O
not O
be O
real O
syrup O
and O
have O
fructose O
. O
 
do O
you O
have O
any O
resources O
that O
indicate O
that O
i O
looked O
a O
bit O
but O
didn O
t O
see O
anything O
that O
indicated O
above O
3.0 O
indicated O
subclinical O
. O
i O
m O
not O
doubting O
you O
, O
but O
anything O
i O
could O
hand O
to O
my O
doctor O
would O
help O
 
There O
is O
a O
growing O
, O
and O
vocal O
, O
community O
of O
disabled O
writers O
and O
artists O
who O
could O
offer O
some O
pointers O
on O
how O
to O
depict O
life O
with O
m.s O
. O
in O
a O
way O
that O
is O
both O
accurate O
and O
respectful O
. O
As O
people O
here O
have O
already O
pointed O
out O
, O
for O
instance O
, O
it O
s O
not O
that O
likely O
that O
your O
protagonist O
would O
have O
to O
care O
full O
time O
for O
a O
mother O
with O
rrms O
unless O
she O
has O
had O
it O
for O
so O
long O
it O
s O
progressed O
into O
a O
different O
form O
. O
I O
d O
also O
ask O
you O
to O
ask O
yourself O
why O
choose O
m.s O
. O
in O
the O
first O
place O
Do O
you O
have O
a O
personal O
reason O
, O
or O
did O
it O
just O
sound O
right O
for O
your O
story O
Your O
motivation O
and O
intention O
going O
in O
will O
absolutely O
be O
picked O
up O
on O
by O
your O
readers O
, O
whether O
they O
have O
ms O
or O
not O
. O
I O
d O
suggest O
checking O
out O
the O
discussions O
on O
twitter O
under O
the O
hashtag O
criplit O
. O
It O
may O
be O
very O
informative O
for O
you O
. O
 
This O
is O
a O
cheap O
, O
low O
to O
no O
side O
effect O
treatment O
. O
If O
you O
are O
needing O
to O
take O
a O
laxative B-DRUG
you O
may O
as O
well O
use O
manitol B-DRUG
. O
 
Just O
curious O
what O
similarities O
we O
share O
... O
 
Then O
you O
got O
ta O
get O
used O
to O
CPAP O
or O
hit O
the O
knife O
. O
 
8mm O
is O
a O
pretty O
large B-DIS
stone I-DIS
to O
pass O
. O
According O
to O
this O
you O
only O
have O
about O
a O
40 O
chance O
of O
being O
able O
to O
pass O
a O
stone O
of O
that O
size O
without O
surgical O
intervention O
, O
**and** O
it O
takes O
weeks O
to O
do O
so O
. O
I O
can O
t O
imagine O
being O
in O
that O
amount O
of O
pain B-DIS
for O
weeks O
. O
Ugh O
. O
The O
urologist O
I O
went O
to O
said O
at O
5 O
mm O
he O
always O
recommends O
surgery O
. O
I O
assume O
that O
you O
didn O
t O
catch O
the O
stone O
you O
did O
pass O
That O
s O
unfortunate O
. O
If O
you O
catch O
them O
by O
straining O
your O
urine O
you O
can O
have O
it O
analyzed O
and O
that O
can O
help O
your O
doctor O
formulate O
a O
plan O
of O
attack O
for O
treating O
and O
preventing O
them O
. O
For O
the O
most O
common O
type O
of O
stone O
, O
calcium-oxalate O
, O
there O
is O
nothing O
you O
can O
do O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
a O
stone O
once O
it O
s O
formed O
. O
You O
either O
pass O
it O
or O
have O
it O
surgically O
treated O
. O
Don O
t O
believe O
what O
you O
read O
on O
the O
Internet O
either O
. O
Again O
, O
for O
calcium-oxalate O
stones O
, O
there O
is O
**zero** O
evidence O
that O
anything O
you O
ingest O
has O
any O
effect O
on O

undergoing O

All O
that O
I O
have O
experienced O
is O
vertigo B-DIS
, O
with O
nausea B-DIS
and O
I O
can B-DIS
not I-DIS
move O
. O
No O
hallucinations O
. O
Just O
recently O
I O
went O
to O
see O
an O
acupuncturist O
who O
told O
me O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
my O
IUD B-DRUG
. O
I O
did O
and O
I O
have O
been O
vertigo-free O
for O
3 O
weeks O
in O
a O
row O
today O
, O
where O
as O
the O
past O
5 O
months O
I O
had O
an O
episode O
every O
4-6 O
days O
. O
I O
will O
do O
more O
testing O
have O
a O
PCP O
appointment O
tomorrow O
and O
will O
ask O
my O
liver O
kidneys O
be O
tested O
 
I O
know O
that O
feeling O
and O
I O
used O
to O
get O
it O
all O
the O
time O
from O
higher O
doses O
of O
beta B-DRUG
blockers I-DRUG
. O
In O
the O
end O
I O
had O
to O
reduce O
the O
amount O
to O
the O
lowest O
possible O
dose O
so O
that O
it O
wouldn O
t O
happen O
. O
Even O
now O
, O
however O
, O
it O
still O
happens O
... O
albeit O
very O
rarely O
. O
I O
notice O
that O
it O
s O
worse O
for O
me O
when O
I O
spend O
more O
time O
not O
sitting O
up O
right O
, O
i.e O
. O
too O
much O
time O
laying O
in O
bed O
. O
I O
find O
that O
this O
, O
if O
it O
occurs O
over O
about O
36 O
hours O
or O
so O
, O
causes O
my O
average O
resting O
HR O
to O
lower O
to O
the O
point O
that O
when O
I O
do O
finally O
come O
to O
lie O
down O
at O
night O
it O
actually O
dips O
too O
low O
and O
produces O
the O
effects O
you O
have O
described O
. O
For O
this O
reason O
, O
I O
try O
to O
sit O
up O
with O
feet O
on O
the O
ground O
more O
, O
and O
also O
to O
ensure O
that O
I O
get O
up O
and O
move O
a O
bit O
without O
pushing O
the O
HR O
too O
high O
periodically O
throughout O
the O
day O
. O
The O
end O
result O
is O
a O
slightly O
higher O
resting O
HR O
that O
prevents O
it O
from O
going O
too O
low O
with O
the O
inevitable O
dip O
that O
comes O
from O
getting O
into O
bed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
day O
. O
Hope O
that O
helps O
. O
edit O
I O
ve O
never O
taken O
corlanor B-DRUG
- O
only O
beta B-DRUG
blockers I-DRUG
, O
which O
I O
react O
to O
due O
to O
mast B-DIS
cell I-DIS
activation I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
- O
so O
maybe O
take O
my O
advice O
with O
a O
grain O
of O
salt O
. O
 
That O
s O
great O
Thanks O
for O
the O
advice O
too O
I O
m O
so O
scared O
people O
are O
gon O
na O
start O
to O
notice O
before O
it O
gets O
better O
but O
heating O
things O
like O
this O
gives O
me O
hope O
 
yeah O
pretty O
much O
 
I O
suspect O
I O
am O
gluten B-DIS
intolerant I-DIS
so O
I O
do O
my O
best O
to O
avoid O
gluten O
. O
But O
I O
have O
not O
been O
officially O
checked O
out O
for O
that O
yet O
. O
I O
ve O
heard O
of O
a O
very O
loose O
link O
between O
chronic B-DIS
bronchitis I-DIS
and O
IC B-DIS
. O
It O
was O
like O
... O
chronic B-DIS
bronchitis I-DIS
weakens B-DIS
the I-DIS
immune I-DIS
system I-DIS
which O
opens O
the O
door O
for O
IC B-DIS
or O
something O
like O
that O
. O
Do O
you O
remember O
what O
you O
heard O
about O
it O
Although O
I O
m O
sure O
all O
chronic O
illnesses O
are O
connected O
in O
some O
way O
or O
another O
... O
 
All O
of O
the O
probiotic O
pills O
that O
I O
ve O
ever O
tried O
over O
the O
years O
have O
just O
made O
me O
sicker B-DIS
or O
didn O
t O
help O
Align B-DRUG
, O
Tuzen B-DRUG
, O
Culturette B-DRUG
, O
HFM B-DRUG
Forte I-DRUG
. O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
actually O
helped O
my O
IBS B-DIS
was O
natural O
food O
based O
probiotics O
raw O
sauerkraut O
, O
kefir O
, O
kombucha O
, O
yogurt O
, O
etc O
... O
. O
Of O
course O
everyone O
varies O
, O
you O
might O
find O
a O
supplement O
that O
helps O
you O
, O
but O
in O
my O
own O
experience O
nothing O
worked O
better O
than O
raw O
unpasteurized O
saeurkraut O
. O
gt O
; O
But O
the O
bloating B-DIS
gas B-DIS
feeling I-DIS
is O
awful O
. O
Can O
anybody O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
why O
Is O
this O
just O
an O
adjustment O
period O
for O
the O
bacteria O
to O
colonize O
in O
my O
GI O
tract O
That O
s O
fairly O
normal O
. O
A O
byproduct O
of O
gut O
bacteria O
breaking O
down O
food O
is O
gas B-DIS
. O
For O
me O
I O
suffer O
from O
very O
painful B-DIS
trapped I-DIS
gas I-DIS
with O
my O
IBS B-DIS
I O
m O
IBS-C O
predominant O
. O
I O
take O
something O
called O
Semithicone B-DRUG
which O
helps O
break O
down O
the O
gas O
pockets O
and O
lets O
it O
out O
though O
you O
do O
end O
up O
farting O
more O
as O
a O
result O
. O
Better O
out O
than O
in O
as O
they O
say O
. O
I O
also O
felt O
that O
way O
when O
I O
take O
artificial O
man O
made O
pill-form O
probiotics O
though O
. O
All O
of O
them O
made O
me O
felt O
bloated B-DIS
sick O
worse O
, O
and O
it O
didn O
t O
go O
away O
with O
time O
. O
The O
only O
form O
of O
probiotic O
that O
has O
ever O
truely O
helped O
me O
has O
been O
the O
natural O
food O
kind O
, O
like O
the O
ones O
I O
mentioned O
above O
raw O
unpasteurized O
saurkraut O
primarily O
. O
Edit O
I O
ate O
raw O
saurkraut O
for O
2 O
months O
starting O
in O
December O
2016 O
and O
it O
healed O
my O
gut O
more O
in O
those O
2 O
months O
than O
anything O
I O
ve O
tried O
in O
the O
last O
20 O
years O
. O
Like O
I O
mentioned O
in O
another O
post O
I O
can O
now O
eat O
things O
like O
pork O
again O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
15 O
years O
 
. O
It O
s O
really O
quite O
amazing O
. O
I O
still O
get O
horrible O
IBS B-DIS
pain I-DIS
and O
trapped O
gas O
and O
the O
occasional O
IBS O
attack O
from O
certain O
foods O
, O
but O
it O
s O
10x O
better O
now O
after O
eating O
saurkraut O
, O
and O
I O
continue O
to O
eat O
it O
daily O
. O
Edit O
2 O
If O
you O
like O
pickles O
it O
s O
delicious O
. O
Saurkraut O
is O
just O
fermented O
cabbage O
, O
basically O
the O
fermentation O
process O
creates O
a O
TON O
of O
Lactobacillus O
way O
more O
than O
you O
would O
find O
in O
*any* O
probiotic O
pill O
, O
I O
m O
talking O
trillions O
of O
probiotics O
, O
as O
opposoed O
to O
millions O
or O
billions O
in O
most O
probiotic O
pills O
. O
It O
also O
adds O
extra O
vitamins O
and O
nutrients O
to O
the O
cabbage O
so O
saurkraut O
is O
actually O
healthier O
than O
cabbage O
, O
the O
bacteria O
changes O
adds O
all O
sorts O
of O
good O
stuff O
to O
it O
. O
 
I O
didn O
t O
realize O
you O
could O
get O
them O
prescribed O
 
My O
doctor O
had O
me O
do O
a O
spinal O
tap O
after O
my O
MRI O
, O
I O
m O
surprised O
your O
doctor O
is O
doing O
2 O
MRI O
s O
although O
it O
s O
not O
unheard O
of O
If O
you O
ever O
want O
someone O
to O
chat O
with O
please O
PM O
me O
and O
we O
can O
swap O
info O
 
As O
the O
disease O
develops O
into O
the O
later O
stages O
she O
will O
eventually O
possibly O
lose B-DIS
the I-DIS
ability I-DIS
to I-DIS
move I-DIS
all O
together O
without O
medication O
. O
However O
, O
without O
the O
medication O
she O
might O
be O
able O
to O
live O
a O
happier O
life O
for O
a O
shorter O
time O
as O
one O
of O
the O
medications O
you O
can O
take O
comes O
with O
a O
lot O
of O
side O
effects O
including O
depression B-DIS
. O
However O
, O
if O
you O
are O
lucky O
you O
can O
get O
a O
doctor O
to O
get O
her O
the O
newer O
medicine O
which O
comes O
with O
very O
few O
side O
effects O
and O
supposedly O
works O
slightly O
better O
than O
the O
older O
one O
. O
I O
don O
t O
recall O
their O
names O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
get O
a O
good O
doctor O
he O
will O
know O
of O
them O
both O
. O
Also O
, O
without O
proper O
medication O
the O
disease O
might O
evolve O
faster O
so O
she O
will O
get O
to O
the O
point O
of O
falling B-DIS
a I-DIS
lot I-DIS
, O
not B-DIS
being I-DIS
able I-DIS
to I-DIS
move I-DIS
or O
even O
shaking B-DIS
a I-DIS
lot I-DIS
at O
a O
faster O
rate O
than O
while O
on O
medication O
. O
When O
I O
say O
faster O
I O
do O
mean O
it O
could O
still O
take O
up O
to O
5 O
years O
before O
she O
notices O
big O
differences O
, O
all O
depends O
on O
which O
of O
the O
symptoms O
for O
PD B-DIS
she O
has O
, O
for O
there O
are O
different O
types O
of O
PD B-DIS
that O
can O
be O
treated O
differently O
and O
that O
develop O
at O
different O
rates O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
was O
helpful O
in O
anyway O
, O
if O
not O
feel O
free O
to O
PM O
me O
, O
I O
know O
someone O
very O
close O
to O
me O
with O
PD B-DIS
and O
have O
seen O
the O
disease O
evolve O
my O
entire O
life O
so O
I O
would O
like O
to O
think O
I O
know O
a O
bit O
about O
it O
. O
 
I O
had O
to O
try O
steroid B-DRUG
creams I-DRUG
and O
then O
phototherapy B-DRUG
first O
. O
The O
first O
doctor O
I O
saw O
didn O
t O
seem O
that O
interested O
in O
helping O
me O
. O
The O
second O
doctor O
was O
much O
more O
pro-active O
about O
helping O
and O
suggested O
my O
current O
treatment O
wasn O
t O
working O
for O
me O
, O
that O
I O
probably O
wasn O
t O
a O
good O
candidate O
for O
methotrexate B-DRUG
, O
and O
it O
was O
time O
to O
try O
a O
biological B-DRUG
drug I-DRUG
. O
It O
s O
been O
about O
6 O
months O
since O
I O
started O
that O
and O
I O
am O
80-90 O
clear O
. O
 
Yeah O
, O
I O
was O
on O
Humira B-DRUG
for O
a O
year O
, O
then O
off O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
, O
back O
on O
again O
for O
another O
year O
and O
it O
became O
ineffective O
. O
My O
doc O
then O
switched O
me O
to O
Enbrel B-DRUG
which O
worked O
for O
about O
a O
year O
and O
then O
stopped O
. O
I O
was O
then O
on O
90mgs O
of O
Stelara B-DRUG
every O
two O
months O
until O
I O
no O
longer O
had O
insurance O
. O
 
My O
dad O
has O
psp B-DIS
also O
and O
is O
fed O
through O
a O
tube O
, O
he O
can O
however O
eat O
food O
. O
We O
have O
to O
cut O
it O
up O
very O
small O
for O
him O
and O
can O
t O
give O
him O
stuff O
that O
is O
too O
chewy O
or O
leafy O
lettuce O
gets O
stuck O
in O
his O
throat O
. O
The O
tube O
ensures O
he O
gets O
enough O
nutrients O
and O
calories O
because O
he O
just O
can O
t O
consume O
enough O
by O
mouth O
. O
I O
m O
not O
really O
sure O
if O
this O
is O
common O
or O
not O
though O
. O
 
Yeup O
. O
Happens O
to O
me O
if O
I O
eat O
drink O
too O
much O
or O
too O
wuickly O
 
No O
, O
.. O
haven O
t O
even O
heard O
of O
that O
until O
now O
. O
I O
guess O
if O
they O
can O
t O
find O
anything O
at O
my O
appointment O
and O
don O
t O
offer O
any O
further O
help O
, O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
look O
into O
it O
. O
 
This O
morning O
my O
5mm B-DIS
stone I-DIS
passed O
and O
I O
barely O
felt O
it O
. O
Flow O
changed O
slightly O
, O
I O
felt O
a O
little O
tickle O
in O
my O
pickle O
, O
and O
that O
was O
it O
. O
; O
On O
Thursday O
my O
ultrasound O
showed O
that O
the O
stone O
was O
stuck O
at O
the O
opening O
of O
the O
ureter O
into O
the O
bladder O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
taking O
FLOMAX B-DRUG
and O
drinking O
lots O
of O
water O
, O
but O
haven O
t O
had O
much O
pain B-DIS
since O
urine O
was O
passing O
around O
the O
stone O
the O
pain O
is O
from O
the O
kidney O
to O
swelling O
when O
urine O
gets O
backed O
up O
. O
My O
Urologist O
said O
once O
it O
drops O
into O
your O
bladder O
you O
re O
home O
free O
. O
 
I O
was O
being O
medicated O
to O
between O
3-4 O
and O
then O
I O
got O
pregnant O
and O
had O
to O
force O
my O
gp O
to O
refer O
me O
to O
am O
endocrinologist O
so O
they O
could O
up O
my O
meds O
further O
. O
In O
pregnancy O
they O
like O
you O
to O
be O
around O
1-2 O
. O
I O
put O
on O
a O
lot O
less O
weight O
this O
pregnancy O
, O
I O
ve O
has O
so O
much O
more B-DIS
energy I-DIS
. O
And O
the O
endo O
wrote O
a O
letter O
to O
my O
doc O
advising O
them O
that O
they O
feel O
my O
new O
dose O
will O
continue O
to O
be O
the O
dose O
I O
need O
after O
pregnancy O
as O
they O
feel O
if O
I O
m O
childbearing O
age O
so O
it O
s O
safest O
for O
any O
unborn O
babies O
for O
me O
to O
be O
at O
that O
level O
. O
It O
really O
makes O
me O
wonder O
that O
if O
needing O
to O
be O
1-2 O
whilst O
pregnant O
is O
what O
they O
prefer O
as O
it O
s O
safest O
then O
maybe O
most O
people O
need O
to O
be O
close O
to O
that O
I O
really O
hope O
I O
don O
t O
have O
a O
battle O
with O
my O
gp O
as O
I O
need O
to O
lose O
weight O
quite O
considerably O
4-5 O
stone O
and O
if O
they O
lower O
my O
dose O
it O
won O
t O
happen O
. O
At O
my O
worst O
I O
was O
eating O
14-1600 O
cals O
a O
day O
, O
exercising O
for O
half O
an O
hour O
every O
day O
and O
I O
only O
lose O
4 O
lbs O
in O
a O
whole O
month O
literally O
did O
everything O
perfect O
and O
got O
no O
bloody O
results O
. O
Up O
the O
dose O
if O
you O
can O
 
Brilliant O
. O
Thanks O
so O
much O
. O
Will O
google O
and O
have O
a O
read O
 
Yeah O
, O
I O
m O
fine O
on O
gluten O
so O
long O
as O
I O
don O
t O
have O
it O
for O
breakfast O
. O
 
That O
s O
some O
good O
inspiration O
right O
there O
 
I O
feel O
you O
 
Pros O
My O
partner O
, O
an O
adamant O
cat-hater O
, O
has O
come O
to O
the O
light O
in O
my O
quest O
to O
get O
a O
therapy O
cat O
. O
He O
actually O
told O
me O
he O
thought O
I O
would O
benefit O
from O
it O
Cons O
He O
says O
this O
because O
he O
now O
apparently O
feels O
like O
my O
symptoms O
are O
all O
psychosomatic O
because O
my O
hydrodistention B-DIS
came O
back O
unremarkable O
last O
fall O
... O
Pain B-DIS
is O
up O
and O
cat O
shopping O
is O
apparently O
very O
stressful O
, O
so O
advice O
moral O
support O
is O
welcome O
. O
 
Hot O
damn O
. O
My O
company O
gave O
me O
the O
fucking O
run O
around O
, O
clearly O
 
My O
experience O
with O
the O
MS B-DIS
Society O
has O
been O
really O
great O
. O
They O
gave O
me O
advice O
when O
I O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
and O
then O
*after* O
giving O
me O
the O
advice O
asked O
me O
if O
I O
had O
officially O
been O
diagnosed O
. O
I O
don O
t O
think O
they O
d O
have O
issues O
pointing O
you O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
. O
Since O
they O
re O
quite O
a O
distance O
away O
, O
you O
could O
call O
or O
email O
them O
. O
 
i O
think O
i O
have O
seen O
sesame O
and O
beans O
on O
the O
no O
no O
list O
before O
. O
What O
are O
the O
main O
ingredients O
 
They O
did O
and O
it O
was O
positive O
. O
They O
blamed O
the O
narcotics O
I O
was O
also O
on O
. O
Fine O
. O
But O
getting O
them O
to O
do O
another O
without O
a O
scope O
is O
hard O
. O
And O
I O
get O
why O
. O
They O
need O
the O
scope O
. O
But O
even O
after O
with O
now O
five O
different O
gastros O
... O
Come O
on O
. O
I O
ve O
thrown O
every O
damn O
day O
up O
for O
... O
Math O
is O
hard O
... O
8 O
years O
in O
April O
. O
I O
ll O
demand O
for O
another O
test O
. O
But O
gastros O
in O
the O
US O
are O
typically O
in O
it O
for O
money O
. O
 
Does O
anyone O
else O
have O
symptoms O
triggered O
when O
they O
chew O
gum O
I O
know O
the O
artificial O
sweeteners O
play O
a O
role O
for O
me O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
also O
heard O
that O
the O
action O
of O
chewing O
gum O
and O
salivating O
can O
start O
the O
spasms B-DIS
. O
 
I O
just O
looked O
it O
up O
what O
s O
funny O
is O
Iv O
actually O
been O
inadvertently O
following O
that O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
a O
few O
foods O
on O
the O
don O
t O
list O
. O
But O
those O
few O
foods O
haven O
t O
hurt O
me O
... O
 
I O
ve O
always O
had O
issues O
with O
constipation B-DIS
, O
reacurring B-DIS
UTI I-DIS
, O
hideous B-DIS
mouth I-DIS
ulcers I-DIS
, O
stomach B-DIS
pains I-DIS
and O
cramps B-DIS
, O
hiccups B-DIS
every I-DIS
time I-DIS
I I-DIS
eat I-DIS
. O
Ect O
ect O
. O
But O
it O
wasn O
t O
until O
I O
was O
20 O
and O
at O
Uni O
that O
I O
woke O
up O
feeling B-DIS
sick I-DIS
. O
I O
thought O
it O
would O
go O
away O
but O
it O
never O
did O
. O
Four O
years O
later O
I O
was O
finally O
diagnosed O
with O
GP B-DIS
. O
Thankfully O
I O
ve O
only O
ever O
been O
sick O
a O
couple O
of O
times O
. O
I O
recently O
had O
the O
first O
botox B-DRUG
injections I-DRUG
. O
And O
I O
m O
looking O
into O
improving O
my O
diet O
. O
 
I O
called O
the O
Gastro O
clinic O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
ago O
and O
chased O
them O
up O
, O
and O
amazingly O
got O
a O
call O
back O
that O
day O
from O
the O
registrar O
I O
saw O
, O
with O
all O
of O
my O
results O
, O
and O
to O
tell O
me O
what O
s O
going O
to O
happen O
from O
here O
onwards O
. O
He O
s O
pushed O
for O
me O
to O
get O
in O
with O
Dr O
Zarate-Lopez O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
urgency O
and O
I O
just O
got O
an O
appointment O
to O
see O
her O
next O
week O
and O
apparently O
she O
trained O
with O
Dr O
Aziz O
so O
is O
just O
as O
good O
, O
and O
is O
at O
UCLH O
which O
is O
where O
I O
go O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
care O
. O
 
I O
ve O
had O
that O
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
before O
and O
after O
passing B-DIS
a I-DIS
stone I-DIS
, O
and O
eventually O
returned O
to O
normal O
. O
 
Check O
your O
minimum O
pressure O
. O
If O
it O
is O
set O
for O
the O
as-is-out-of-the-box O
pressure O
of O
4cm O
or O
5cm O
, O
you O
might O
need O
it O
raised O
a O
little O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
people O
feel O
like O
they O
can O
t O
breathe O
when O
the O
pressure O
is O
too O
low O
. O
 
You O
probably O
just O
pinched B-DIS
a I-DIS
nerve I-DIS
or O
something O
. O
 
Anabolic B-DRUG
steroids I-DRUG
are O
what O
s O
usually O
associated O
with O
roid B-DIS
rage I-DIS
. O
That O
s O
not O
what O
you O
had O
, O
you O
took O
a O
course O
of O
corticosteroids B-DRUG
. O
That O
s O
not O
to O
say O
you O
didn O
t O
have O
some O
mood B-DIS
changes I-DIS
from O
them O
, O
they O
turn O
the O
metabolism O
way O
up O
, O
so O
can O
definitely O
get O
you O
all O
antsy B-DIS
 
Yes O
, O
it O
absolutely O
sucks O
. O
I O
am O
dreading O
going O
back O
to O
have O
it O
removed O
. O
I O
have O
been O
hearing O
that O
as O
well O
but O
also O
keep O
reading O
stories O
where O
people O
are O
saying O
they O
had O
to O
do O
it O
for O
months O
and O
months O
. O
It O
sucks O
. O
Glad O
to O
hear O
it O
didn O
t O
for O
you O
. O
Did O
it O
help O
you O
at O
all O
Was O
it O
as O
painful B-DIS
as O
a O
cystoscopy O
is O
When O
they O
did O
a O
cystoscopy O
with O
hydro O
on O
me O
, O
I O
was O
in O
pain B-DIS
for O
days O
after O
. O
It O
would O
totally O
take O
me O
out O
of O
work O
now O
. O
 
To O
be O
honest O
natural O
treatments O
helped O
me O
so O
much O
more O
than O
any O
pill O
the O
doctors O
threw O
at O
me O
. O
They O
had O
me O
taking O
topiramate B-DRUG
to O
stop O
the O
migraines B-DIS
I O
had O
maybe O
once O
every O
two O
months O
. O
Next O
thing O
I O
know O
I O
have O
migraines B-DIS
every O
day O
and O
even O
worse O
vertigo B-DIS
. O
I O
went O
to O
an O
herbalist O
and O
found O
some O
tea O
that O
really O
helped O
with O
migraine B-DIS
prevention O
. O
That O
s O
when O
I O
noticed O
I O
was O
still O
having O
issues O
with O
slight O
vertigo B-DIS
and O
tinnitus B-DIS
. O
I O
will O
definitely O
try O
the O
things O
you O
recommended O
Thank O
you O
for O
letting O
me O
know O
what O
worked O
for O
you O
. O
It O
s O
a O
huge O
help O
and O
a O
relief O
. O
 
I O
envy O
you O
for O
getting O
to O
fly O
F-18 O
s. O
I O
flew O
Cessna O
s O
for O
about O
8 O
years O
. O
Had O
to O
have O
a O
special O
issuance O
medical O
from O
the O
FAA O
due O
to O
Crohn O
s O
disease O
. O
It O
was O
frustrating O
because O
they O
wouldn O
t O
think O
twice O
about O
giving O
me O
a O
license O
to O
hurl O
my O
car O
down O
a O
highway O
at O
70 O
mph O
inches O
from O
a O
car O
going O
the O
opposite O
direction O
. O
But O
tell O
them O
you O
want O
to O
fly O
around O
with O
no O
one O
around O
you O
and O
suddenly O
your O
a O
menace O
. O
But O
, O
once O
you O
get O
the O
medical O
you O
re O
good O
to O
go O
. O
After O
that O
you O
know O
what O
to O
do O
to O
get O
the O
medical O
renewed O
. O
 
I O
guess O
it O
could O
help O
if O
you O
were O
also O
drinking O
lots O
of O
water O
concurrently O
 
See O
a O
doctor O
because O
one O
bottle O
is O
just O
s O
start O
. O
Assuming O
it O
s O
mcg O
not O
mg O
, O
150 O
mcg O
would O
be O
fine O
to O
start O
on O
. O
After O
8 O
weeks O
check O
TSH O
, O
fT3 O
, O
fT4 O
, O
TPO O
Ab O
, O
and O
Tg O
Ab O
. O
Goal O
is O
TSH O
below O
2.0 O
ideal O
just O
below O
1.0 O
, O
a O
T3 O
above O
3 O
, O
and O
T4 O
above O
1.0 O
. O
Only O
take O
the O
medication O
on O
an O
empty O
stomach O
and O
don O
t O
eat O
anything O
for O
30-60min O
. O
 
Welcome O
and O
may O
you O
have O
good O
days O
ahead O
. O
 
What O
is O
his O
current O
dose O
I O
had O
years O
of O
odd O
stomach B-DIS
colon B-DIS
issues I-DIS
for O
years O
. O
So O
don O
t O
remember O
anything O
negative O
when O
starting O
Levadopa B-DRUG
. O
If O
anything O
it O
was O
like O
my O
body O
become O
alive O
and O
responsive O
with O
the O
medication O
. O
Also O
Nausea B-DIS
does O
start O
in O
the O
stomach O
, O
but O
the O
brain O
. O
So O
the O
levadopa B-DRUG
may O
cause O
the O
brain O
to O
be O
more O
active O
. O
It O
is O
a O
catch O
22 O
as O
a O
lot O
of O
anti-nausea O
medication O
will O
reduce O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
levadopa B-DRUG
. O
One O
possible O
solution O
is O
taking O
extra O
carbidopa B-DRUG
trade O
name O
Lodosyn B-DRUG
. O
Is O
he O
being O
seen O
by O
a O
MDS O
 
I O
have O
balance B-DIS
issues I-DIS
too O
and O
I O
love O
to O
ride O
my O
bike O
- O
I O
have O
much O
better O
balance O
there O
than O
on O
foot O
. O
My O
exercise O
on O
bike O
is O
not O
mild O
, O
but O
you O
can O
do O
it O
mild O
if O
you O
want O
. O
Just O
a O
few O
kilometers O
in O
nature O
when O
the O
weather O
is O
fine O
and O
afterwards O
ice O
cream O
. O
 
First O
off O
, O
I O
m O
sorry O
that O
you O
had O
to O
seek O
out O
this O
sub O
, O
but O
welcome O
nonetheless O
. O
I O
d O
recommend O
filing O
a O
professional O
complaint O
against O
the O
neurologist O
. O
It O
s O
your O
imagination O
is O
an O
example O
of O
piss-poor O
service O
at O
best O
, O
and O
negligence O
at O
worst O
. O
The O
doctor O
s O
office O
is O
no O
place O
for O
professional O
ennui O
; O
these O
types O
need O
to O
be O
worked O
out O
of O
the O
healthcare O
industry O
. O
Regarding O
your O
father O
s O
audiogram O
, O
it O
s O
a O
tenuous O
connection O
but O
it O
doesn O
t O
hurt O
to O
check O
. O
If O
he O
s O
not O
experiencing O
the O
classical O
symptoms O
then O
he O
s O
unlikely O
to O
be O
diagnosed O
, O
but O
it O
s O
always O
good O
to O
cover O
your O
bases O
. O
Regarding O
your O
diet O
, O
I O
believe O
fruit O
is O
going O
to O
become O
your O
best O
friend O
in O
the O
near O
future O
. O
That O
s O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
come O
up O
with O
aside O
from O
refined O
sugar O
candies O
to O
provide O
the O
calories O
you O
need O
without O
the O
sodium O
you O
don O
t. O
Before O
you O
give O
up O
on O
your O
current O
diet O
, O
try O
making O
some O
vegan O
smoothies O
using O
nut O
milks O
butters O
or O
soy O
for O
texture O
and O
protein O
. O
They O
re O
surprisingly O
good O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O
, O
and O
keep O
us O
posted O
when O
you O
can O
. O
 
I O
ve O
been O
on O
it O
since O
2008 O
. O
I O
do O
the O
injectable O
version O
, O
it O
has O
far O
less O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
don O
t O
even O
think O
about O
it O
anymore O
, O
it O
s O
just O
something O
I O
do O
every O
week O
. O
It O
doesn O
t O
cause O
any O
problems O
for O
me O
. O
 
That O
s O
awesome O
. O
I O
m O
also O
not O
on O
DMDs B-DRUG
and O
take O
LDN B-DRUG
, O
low O
dose O
Naltrexone O
and O
it O
has O
changed O
my O
life O
. O
My O
right B-DIS
foot I-DIS
drop I-DIS
is O
gone O
and O
my O
walking O
is O
back O
to O
normal O
. O
I O
was O
DX O
d O
in O
2004 O
and O
no O
one O
can O
tell O
I O
have O
MS B-DIS
now O
. O
Even O
my O
neuro O
is O
happy O
and O
will O
not O
push O
anything O
unless O
something O
happens O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
relapse O
free O
for O
9 O
years O
. O
 
The O
past O
4 O
years O
or O
so O
I O
ve O
gotten O
migraines B-DIS
ranging O
from O
every O
few O
months O
to O
once O
a O
week O
or O
more O
. O
They O
start O
as O
a O
burning B-DIS
tight B-DIS
neck I-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
then O
radiate O
up O
into O
the O
back O
of O
my O
skull O
and O
shoot O
straight O
through O
my O
brain O
into O
my O
forehead O
. O
They O
did O
get O
less O
frequent O
when O
I O
started O
in O
on O
good O
medication O
, O
so O
I O
think O
it O
might O
have O
had O
something O
to O
do O
with O
my O
neck B-DIS
pain I-DIS
being O
the O
root O
trigger O
of O
the O
problem O
, O
rather O
than O
just O
the O
first O
symptom O
of O
a O
migraine O
. O
 
I O
usually O
feel O
as O
tired B-DIS
as O
you O
only O
in O
the O
morning O
now O
which O
is O
very O
weird O
for O
me O
because O
i O
m O
usually O
VERY O
energetic O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
throughout O
the O
day O
. O
If O
you O
get O
your O
heart O
rate O
above O
a O
good O
BPM O
look O
up O
chart O
online O
and O
look O
for O
sex O
age O
for O
at O
least O
30-60 O
min O
per O
day O
that O
s O
a O
workout O
. O
Other O
than O
exercise O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
suggest O
is O
maybe O
changing O
your O
diet O
or O
making O
sure O
not O
to O
eat O
junk O
food O
or O
soda O
. O
I O
really O
have O
no O
clue O
because O
you O
just O
talked O
about O
exercising O
and O
feeling B-DIS
tired I-DIS
. O
Weight O
could O
be O
a O
factor O
and O
maybe O
even O
depression B-DIS
but O
don O
t O
forget O
that O
I O
know O
LITERALLY O
nothing O
about O
you O
except O
what O
you O
gave O
us O
in O
your O
post O
. O
 
It O
can O
build O
up O
in O
your O
body O
and O
stay O
there O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
with O
that O
info O
drs O
should O
be O
making O
an O
effort O
to O
minimize O
your O
need O
for O
contrast O
and O
get O
all O
the O
scans O
done O
in O
one O
day O
. O
 
gt O
; O
Which O
imo O
is O
the O
only O
way O
to O
go O
after O
reading O
that O
our O
needs O
can O
change O
from O
night O
to O
night O
let O
alone O
year O
to O
year O
. O
many O
peoples O
needs O
change O
*hour O
to O
hour* O
 
My O
guess O
is O
that O
the O
cost O
difference O
is O
negligible O
from O
a O
materials O
standpoint O
but O
there O
is O
added O
software O
cost O
developing O
the O
algorithms O
. O
He O
ll O
, O
I O
wouldn O
t O
doubt O
that O
the O
only O
difference O
under O
the O
hood O
is O
the O
software O
on O
the O
controller O
. O
 
Thank O
you O
. O
 
Thanks O
everyone O
, O
it O
certainly O
is O
different O
for O
everyone O
I O
ve O
never O
enjoyed O
the O
heat O
and O
I O
just O
attribute O
it O
to O
causing O
me O
additional O
stress B-DIS
and O
that O
coming O
off O
as O
IBS B-DIS
. O
Of O
course O
once O
it O
s O
actually O
happening O
the O
heat O
then O
just O
causes O
even O
more O
physical B-DIS
discomfort I-DIS
. O
Anyway O
, O
it O
s O
cooler O
today O
and O
I O
m O
hoping O
for O
a O
better O
day O
 
I O
refer O
to O
my O
stent O
experience O
as O
the O
devil O
s O
magic O
trick O
. O
 
The O
care O
is O
excellent O
... O
once O
you O
can O
actually O
reach O
it O
It O
s O
the O
insurance O
that O
Guards O
the O
gates O
and O
gets O
you O
going O
and O
coming O
from O
both O
ends O
. O
They O
not O
only O
get O
a O
cut O
from O
You O
, O
but O
they O
also O
get O
a O
cut O
from O
the O
doctors O
for O
malpractice O
insurance O
as O
well O
. O
So O
doctors O
charge O
outlandish O
rates O
because O
frankly O
they O
have O
to O
just O
to O
break O
even O
, O
and O
then O
you O
have O
them O
actually O
wanting O
to O
make O
a O
living O
on O
top O
of O
that O
and O
it O
gets O
even O
worse O
. O
All O
the O
while O
insurance O
companies O
rake O
in O
the O
profits O
. O
 
I O
return O
the O
next O
day O
but O
the O
full O
effects O
don O
t O
kick O
in O
like O
a O
couple O
weeks O
later O
. O
Sorta O
a O
gradual O
, O
oh O
hey O
... O
I O
m O
ok O
... O
I O
feel O
great O
feeling O
. O
 
I O
m O
a O
sleep O
tech O
and O
honestly O
if O
you O
are O
doing O
well O
just O
buy O
your O
mask O
yourself O
and O
do O
your O
thing O
. O
The O
only O
time O
you O
should O
see O
a O
doc O
is O
if O
your O
machine O
starts O
to O
degrade O
or O
if O
you O
suddenly O
stop O
sleeping O
well O
. O
I O
m O
glad O
it O
s O
working O
for O
you O
. O
 
Ask O
with O
sincerity O
from O
your O
heart O
 
Thank O
you O
so O
much O
this O
makes O
me O
feel O
a O
lot O
better O
 
Me O
too O
. O
I O
m O
still O
not O
symmetrical O
and O
is O
only O
been O
in O
the O
last O
2 O
years O
dx O
was O
15 O
years O
ago O
that O
my O
hands O
and O
feet O
and O
been O
consistently O
affected O
 
I O
ve O
had O
both O
hips B-DIS
replaced I-DIS
. O
When O
you O
get O
to O
the O
hospital O
they O
ll O
take O
to O
a O
room O
or O
area O
where O
you O
get O
undressed O
and O
the O
nurses O
will O
give O
you O
an O
iv O
. O
They O
can O
give O
you O
something O
to O
ease O
your O
nerves O
too O
. O
You O
ll O
meet O
with O
the O
anesthesiologist O
and O
probably O
the O
surgeon O
too O
. O
When O
it O
s O
time O
for O
the O
surgery O
they O
ll O
wheel O
you O
in O
, O
breathe O
through O
a O
mask O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
and O
fall O
asleep O
, O
then O
wake O
up O
in O
the O
recovery O
room O
with O
a O
new O
hip O
. O
You O
stay O
there O
for O
an O
hour O
or O
so O
while O
the O
anesthesia O
wears O
off O
and O
nurses O
talk O
to O
you O
and O
check O
you O
out O
. O
Once O
you O
get O
in O
your O
room O
, O
you O
ll O
have O
a O
little O
time O
to O
chill O
, O
maybe O
eat O
a O
little O
and O
drink O
some O
water O
. O
They O
get O
you O
out O
of O
bed O
and O
doing O
physical O
therapy O
pretty O
quickly O
. O
As O
long O
as O
there O
s O
no O
problems O
you O
ll O
only O
be O
in O
the O
hospital O
1 O
or O
2 O
nights O
. O
The O
first O
couple O
weeks O
until O
you O
get O
the O
staples O
out O
there O
is O
some O
mild B-DIS
pain I-DIS
discomfort B-DIS
, O
after O
that O
it O
starts O
getting O
easier O
and O
better O
rapidly O
. O
You O
ll O
have O
to O
do O
physical O
therapy O
exercises O
daily O
. O
Doing O
groceries O
and O
shopping O
for O
the O
first O
2 O
to O
3 O
weeks O
can O
be O
tough O
if O
there O
s O
a O
lot O
of O
walking O
. O
Use O
the O
motor O
scooter O
cart O
or O
have O
someone O
help O
you O
. O
After O
a O
month O
or O
so O
you O
should O
notice O
things O
feeling O
stronger O
and O
less O
uncomfortable O
. O
After O
my O
last O
hip O
replacement O
I O
was O
going O
on O
rather O
long O
bicycle O
rides O
around O
the O
city O
by O
3 O
months O
. O
You O
will O
have O
to O
stop O
taking O
whatever O
meds O
your O
on O
for O
a O
time O
before O
and O
after O
the O
surgery O
. O
My O
surgeon O
 
wanted O
me O
off O
methotrexate B-DRUG
for O
a O
month O
before O
and O
a O
month O
after O
the O
surgery O
. O
He O
had O
me O
stop O
celebrex B-DRUG
3 O
days O
before O
and O
I O
think O
I O
remember O
being O
able O
to O
start O
celebrex B-DRUG
right O
after O
the O
surgery O
. O
 
cpap O
stands O
for O
continuous O
positive O
airway O
pressure O
. O
apap O
stands O
for O
automatic O
positive O
airway O
pressure O
. O
There O
is O
also O
bpap O
for O
bilevel O
and O
vpap O
for O
variable O
. O
these O
two O
are O
more O
for O
central B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
The O
first O
machines O
could O
only O
be O
set O
to O
one O
pressure O
and O
were O
called O
cpap O
. O
Since O
then O
they O
ve O
refined O
things O
a O
bit O
. O
For O
obstructive B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
, O
the O
apap O
adjusts O
the O
pressure O
to O
the O
minimum O
needed O
to O
maintain O
the O
airway O
. O
It O
s O
really O
cool O
technology O
, O
and O
in O
any O
case O
, O
people O
will O
sometimes O
refer O
to O
any O
and O
all O
of O
it O
as O
CPAP O
, O
since O
those O
were O
the O
first O
machines O
and O
all O
the O
others O
are O
just O
more O
advanced O
versions O
. O
Also O
, O
with O
any O
machine O
, O
you O
can O
have O
supplemental O
oxygen O
. O
 
Good O
Podcast O
. O
It O
sounds O
so O
familiar O
, O
I O
still O
remember O
telling O
my O
wife O
No O
, O
I O
don O
t O
have O
Parkinsons B-DIS
- O
I O
just O
need O
to O
cut O
down O
on O
coffee O
. O
Dystonia B-DIS
is O
another O
one O
that O
just O
isn O
t O
that O
well O
known O
. O
My O
toes B-DIS
always I-DIS
curled I-DIS
under I-DIS
for O
no O
reason O
hence O
massive O
foot O
surgery O
to O
straighten O
out O
my O
toes O
. O
A O
few O
years O
later O
I O
heard O
that O
term O
Dystonia B-DIS
. O
Parkinsons B-DIS
sucks O
, O
but O
I O
have O
meet O
so O
many O
wonderful O
people O
it O
is O
amazing O
. O
We O
re O
part O
of O
the O
club O
no O
one O
wants O
to O
join O
. O
One O
thing O
to O
clear O
up O
was O
her O
discussion O
about O
DBS B-DIS
-- O
Lots O
of O
things O
are O
not O
correct O
, O
they O
do O
approve O
DBS B-DIS
for O
younger O
. O
Irony O
is O
it O
has O
nailed O
my O
Dystonia B-DIS
-- O
no O
issue O
. O
Still O
working O
on O
my O
settings O
for O
tremor B-DIS
control O
. O
 
Oh O
god O
, O
that O
sounds O
really O
awful O
. O
I O
m O
sorry O
you O
had O
to O
go O
through O
this O
... O
and O
I O
m O
glad O
you O
re O
better O
 
Thanks O
for O
the O
feedback O
. O
Seems O
like O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
ask O
for O
an O
MRI O
. O
I O
feel O
anxious B-DIS
and O
tense B-DIS
all O
the O
time O
. O
And O
I O
hate O
how O
the O
tingling B-DIS
numbness B-DIS
feels O
. O
So O
far O
thats O
all O
I O
ve O
experienced O
. O
I O
m O
not O
overweight O
, O
and O
I O
m O
pretty O
healthy O
. O
Everyone O
once O
in O
a O
while O
my O
head B-DIS
feels I-DIS
off I-DIS
. O
 
Colbetesol B-DRUG
says O
not O
to O
put O
it O
there O
. O
but O
I O
do O
. O
And O
it O
clears O
it O
right O
up O

I O
just O

because O
I O
had O
nasal B-DIS
valve I-DIS
collapse I-DIS
, O
swollen B-DIS
turbinates I-DIS
, O
and O
a O
deviated B-DIS

. O
I O
m O
still O
recovering O
but O
my O
sleep O
is O
slowly O
getting O
better O
. O
 
I O
think O
you O
mean O
to O
say O
OP O
should O
avoid O
Afrin B-DRUG
and O
not O
Flonase B-DRUG
. O
I O
m O
not O
aware O
of O
any O
issues O
with O
daily O
use O
of O
Flonase B-DRUG
, O
which O
is O
just O
a O
nasal B-DRUG
steroid I-DRUG

Thanks O
for O
the O
info O
. O
I O
was O
thinking O
the O
repititive O
motion O
will O
1 O
. O
Get O
the O
body O
moving O
2 O
. O
Possibly O
stimulate O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
brain O
in O
as O
both O
sides O
of O
the O
body O
are O
moving O
. O
 
When O
using O
the O
lice O
comb O
, O
as O
long O
as O
I O
don O
t O
go O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
base O
of O
the O
comb O
I O
have O
minimal O
resistance O
. O
I O
think O
the O
key O
is O
going O
slow O
at O
first O
until O
you O
can O
get O
perfect O
form O
. O
I O
normally O
will O
go O
from O
the O
scalp O
from O
the O
forehead O
hairline O
to O
about O
the O
mid O
part O
of O
my O
head O
. O
Then O
go O
the O
other O
direction O
from O
the O
hairline O
from O
my O
neck O
to O
the O
midway O
. O
Then O
just O
part O
my O
hair O
around O
the O
trouble O
areas O
and O
do O
a O
thorough O
descaling O
. O
Then O
just O
clean O
up O
the O
flakes O
etc O
etc O
. O
With O
the O
dandruff O
brush O
I O
don O
t O
push O
any O
harder O
than O
I O
would O
with O
a O
normal O
brush O
. O
I O
usually O
just O
go O
in O
all O
directions O
until O
I O
hit O
every O
spot O
a O
few O
times O
. O
Haven O
t O
noticed O
any O
real O
yanking O
or O
excess O
hair O
falling O
out O
from O
it O
. O
 
Look O
up O
the O
ADA- O
Americans O
with O
Disabilities O
Act O
ada.gov O
. O
Employers O
with O
15 O
or O
more O
employees O
I O
believe O
can O
not O
discriminate O
against O
you O
for O
having O
a O
physical O
or O
mental O
disability O
and O
you O
can O
be O
provided O
reasonable O
accommodations O
. O
I O
would O
start O
by O
looking O
that O
up O
and O
maybe O
contacting O
someone O
through O
their O
website O
, O
talking O
to O
your O
HR O
department O
, O
and O
possibly O
consulting O
a O
lawyer O
. O
 
She O
is O
really O
young O
to O
suffer O
from O
Rheumatoid B-DIS
Arthritis I-DIS
. O
Since O
it O
s O
incurable O
I O
would O
recommend O
yoga O
and O
massage O
techniques O
which O
may O
effectively O
help O
your O
wife O
gain O
relief O
from O
the O
horrible O
pain.I B-DIS
recommend O
you O
visit O
a O
Siddha O
Healing O
Centre O
which O
can O
give O
you O
the O
much-needed O
relief O
from O
the O
pain B-DIS
. O
 
Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
your O
reply O
. O
I O
love O
you O
all O
. O
Doing O
a O
quick O
search O
, O
I O
learned O
that O
it O
is O
not O
good O
to O
eat O
protein O
a O
couple O
hours O
before O
Carbidevopa B-DRUG
, O
which O
is O
odd O
because O
years O
with O
my O
dads O
neurologist O
, O
and O
he O
has O
never O
told O
me O
this O
My O
dad O
has O
been O
seeing O
the O
same O
Neurologist O
for O
over O
6 O
years O
. O
Im O
searching O
into O
find O
a O
local O
MDS O
for O
him O
to O
visit O
. O
His O
social O
security O
disability O
entitles O
him O
to O
Medicaid O
as O
of O
recently O
so O
I O
image O
a O
whole O
array O
of O
options O
will O
open O
to O
him O
. O
I O
am O
looking O
at O
local O
caregivers O
, O
and O
I O
will O
definitely O
try O
to O
book O
him O
with O
a O
occupational O
therapist O
as O
well O
. O
The O
thing O
with O
caregivers O
, O
is O
that O
hes O
able O
to O
walk O
about O
30 O
of O
the O
time O
. O
What O
would O
the O
caregiver O
do O
if O
his O
freezing O
episodes O
are O
completely O
random O
Often O
at O
night O
is O
the O
worst O
for O
him O
, O
and O
his O
biggest O
problem O
is O
not O
being O
able O
to O
turn O
in O
bed O
. O
Would O
a O
caregiver O
really O
stay O
up O
all O
night O
incase O
he O
wakes O
Thank O
you O
. O
 
No O
swelling B-DIS
and O
redness B-DIS
suggests O
it O
s O
not O
RA B-DIS
, O
I O
didn O
t O
have O
redness B-DIS
but O
it O
all O
started O
with O
swelling B-DIS
before O
it O
even O
got O
really O
painful B-DIS
. O
Either O
way O
it O
could O
be O
serious O
and O
if O
it O
is O
it O
s O
way O
better O
to O
be O
proactive O
and O
see O
a O
doctor O
ASAP O
, O
the O
costs O
could O
be O
much O
worse O
if O
you O
wait O
until O
it O
s O
worse O
... O
Side O
note O
, O
vitamin B-DIS
D I-DIS
deficiencies I-DIS
can O
cause O
joint B-DIS
pain I-DIS
and O
I O
believe O
vitamin O
D O
is O
water O
soluble O
meaning O
if O
you O
have O
too O
much O
you O
pee O
it O
out O
so O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
while O
to O
try O
that O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
flare B-DIS
during O
the O
darker O
seasons O
. O
But O
you O
should O
really O
see O
a O
doctor O
, O
these O
things O
tend O
to O
get O
worse O
not O
better O
. O
 
If O
he O
loses O
his O
job O
due O
to O
this O
illness O
, O
he O
won O
t O
have O
any O
insurance O
. O
His O
wife O
, O
my O
mother O
is O
a O
retired O
teacher O
. O
He O
has O
started O
on O
levodopa B-DRUG
already O
but O
just O
started O
it O
recently O
. O
 
I O
scored O
maybe O
3-4 O
points O
. O
But O
I O
don O
t O
think O
that O
matters O
. O
I O
do O
know O
and O
feel O
not O
utilising O
my O
brain O
fully O
, O
I O
also O
know O
that O
people O
sleep O
in O
REM O
mode O
but O
I O
have O
not O
for O
years O
and O
that O
I O
don O
t O
wake O
rested O
. O
I O
could O
maybe O
buy O
a O
machine O
and O
then O
re-sell O
for O
a O
similar O
price O
. O
I O
am O
from O
UK O
btw O
. O
I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
going O
in O
and O
telling O
the O
GP O
about O
recessed B-DIS
jaw I-DIS
and O
sleep B-DIS
issues I-DIS
would O
result O
in O
a O
referral O
for O
sleep O
study O

I O

on O
off O
humira B-DRUG
for O
the O
past O
6 O
years O
due O
to O
financial O
problems O
, O
situations O
and O
when O
my O

inevitably O
comes O
back O
the O
pitting B-DIS
and O
splitting B-DIS
like O
this O
happens O
every O
time O
. O
Hate O
to O
say O
this O
but O
the O
only O
way O
to O
solve O
this O
for O
me O
was O
with O
biologics B-DRUG
. O
Wish O

my O
humira B-DRUG
running O

situation O
and O
I O
m O
**really** O
not O
looking O
forward O
to O
having O

it O
takes O
about O
6 O
months O
to O
replace O
a O
full O
nail O

to O
fix O
the O
problem O
. O
 
Ah O

for O
free O
. O
They O
make O
enough O
money O
off O
the O
appliance O
I O
d O
expect O
that O
from O
any O
of O
them O
. O
Didn O
t O
get O
what O
they O
told O
me O
from O
the O
insurance O
side O
of O
things O
tho O
. O
Only O
got O
a O
couple O
hundred O
