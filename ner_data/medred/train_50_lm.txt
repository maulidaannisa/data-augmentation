If O
you O
ve O
been O
on O
a O
low O
calorie O
diet O
exercise O
for O
a O
long O
time O
, O
probably O
you O
have O
low B-DIS
free I-DIS
T3 I-DIS
blood I-DIS
levels I-DIS
causing O
your O
hypo B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
. O
You O
should O
ask O
specifically O
for O
freeT3 O
and O
freeT4 O
to O
be O
tested O
. O
The O
low B-DIS
conversion I-DIS
of I-DIS
T4 I-DIS
to I-DIS
T3 I-DIS
is O
your O
bodies O
way O
of O
protecting O
itself O
from O
any O
further O
calorie B-DIS
deficiet I-DIS
. O
The O
rest O
of O
this O
only O
matters O
if O
you O
do O
get O
low B-DIS
T3 I-DIS
confirmed O
it O
is O
important O
you O
do O
not O
go O
on O
a O
T4 B-DRUG
monotherapy I-DRUG
, O
it O
would O
very O
likely O
make O
your O
situation O
worse O
because O
it O
s O
tricking O
your O
brain O
into O
thinking O
you O
have O
more O
then O
enough O
thyroid O
hormones O
, O
while O
your O
T3 O
deficit O
worsens O
. O
Either O
get O
T3 O
and O
T4 O
combination O
or O
no O
medication O
. O
Instead O
make O
sure O
you O
have O
enough O
Iodine O
, O
Selenium O
and O
Zinc O
in O
your O
diet O
and O
consider O
significantly O
increasing O
your O
calorie O
intake O
It O
seems O
paradoxical O
but O
because O
this O
will O
eventually O
increase O
you O
T3 O
levels O
and O
basal O
metabolic O
rate O
it O
will O
not O
necessarily O
make O
you O
gain O
weight O
in O
the O
long O
term O
. O
Also O
dizzy B-DIS
spells I-DIS
could O
be O
low B-DIS
blood I-DIS
sugar I-DIS
even O
if O
you O
don O
t O
who O
the O
classical O
symptoms O
of O
shaking B-DIS
sweating B-DIS
. O
If O
it O
is O
low O
blood O
sugar O
you O
need O
to O
be O
careful O
with O
that O
and O
make O
sure O
to O
get O
some O
glucose O
quick O
both O
for O
preventing O
your O
dizzines B-DIS
causing O
accidents O
and O
also O
because O
every O
hypoglycemic B-DIS
state I-DIS
will O
stress O
out O
your O
metabolic O
system O
, O
autoamplifying O
the O
low O
T3 O

I O
sometimes O
take O
1 O
packet O
of O
the O
Normalyte B-DRUG
per O
day O
instead O
of O
2 O
, O
I O
just O
go O
by O
how O
I O
feel O
. O
Not O
sure O
if O
you O
can O
get O
a O
prescription O
or O
not O
, O
in O
the O
US O
where O
I O
am O
it O
s O
probably O
not O
possible O
. O
I O
get O
them O
in O
bulk O
from O
the O
manufacturer O
for O
a O
little O
discount O
. O
The O
Vitassium B-DRUG
capsules O
are O
smaller O
than O
the O
SaltStick O
variety O
, O
and O
certainly O
not O
the O
biggest O
pill O
I O
take O
each O
day O

tomorrow O
I O

It O
s O
always O
good O
to O
spread O
positivity O

when O
i O
had O
my O
first O
colonoscopy O
they O
put O
me O
under O
but O
i O
woke O
up O
half O
way O
through O
and O
watched O
it O
all O
on O
the O
tv O
monitor O
. O
i O
didn O
t O
feel O
a O
thing O
. O
recently O
i O
was O
hospitalized O
and O
they O
did O
a O
half O
scope O
not O
sure O
the O
correct O
term.. O
and O
they O
didn O
t O
give O
me O
any O
drugs O
at O
all O
and O
it O
hurt O
SO O
BAD O
i O
was O
basically O
screaming O
out O
in O
pain B-DIS
and O
they O
did O
nothing O
to O
help O
me O
. O
i O
think O
it O
all O
depends O
on O
the O
doctor O
. O
blah O
. O

My O
fist O
ent O
did O
not O
diagnose O
me O
right O
, O
went O
for O
second O
opinion O
and O
got O
referred O
to O
a O
neurotologist O
. O
First O
time O
I O
heard O
the O
whistling B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
left I-DIS
ear I-DIS
was O
in O
bed O
and O
almost O
got O
a O
panick B-DIS
attack I-DIS
, O
search O
YouTube O
on O
controlling O
panic B-DIS
attacks I-DIS
by O
breathing O
technics O
it O
really O
works O
, O
It O
helped O
my O
wife O
with O
her O
attacks B-DIS
unrelated O
to O
menier O
s O
Now O
I O
just O
ignore O
it O

Good O

First O
let O
me O
say O
I O
understand O
completely O
. O
Nobody O
wants O
to O
think O
practically O
and O
do O
the O
mature O
thing O
that O
will O
actually O
work O
. O
You O
re O
hurt O
and O
you O
want O
to O
be O
loved O
. O
Somebody O
is O
trying O
to O
be O
there O
for O
you O
. O
You O
can O
mess O
with O
him O
and O
put O
him O
through O
a O
ton O
of O
shit O
and O
it O
could O
drag O
on O
for O
like O
two O
years O
that O
way O
, O
but O
if O
he O
s O
not O
prone O
to O
codependency O
he O
will O
leave O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
much O
he O
loves O
all O
the O
other O
things O
about O
you O
. O
You O
will O
do O
and O
say O
ugly O
things O
to O
him O
and O
you O
will O
regret O
it O
later O
. O
I O
promise O
. O
You O
know O
this O
is O
true O
. O
I O
want O
everyone O
to O
have O
to O
feel O
my O
pain O
too O
but O
don O
t O
hurt O
the O
man O
who O
loves O
you O
, O
it O
will O
only O
lessen O
your O
pain O
temporarily O
. O
Tell O
him O
. O
You O
can O
soften O
it O
if O
you O
want O
, O
you O
can O
tell O
him O
you O
have O
BPD B-DIS
or O
just O
say O
that O
sometimes O
you O
have O
such O
intense B-DIS
mood I-DIS
swings I-DIS
that O
you O
don O
t O
know O
yourself O
and O
that O
you O
hope O
he O
understands O
if O
he O
sees O
you O
act O
in O
a O
way O
that O
doesn O
t O
align O
with O
the O
person O
he O
thought O
you O
were O
. O
Tell O
him O
. O
I O
wouldn O
t O
want O
to O
either O
, O
but O
ultimately O
what O
you O
truly O
want O
isn O
t O
an O
intense O
couple O
years O
of O
love O
and O
drama O
, O
you O
want O
someone O
to O
stick O
with O
you O
and O
love O
you O
and O
be O
able O
to O
trust O
you O
. O
It O
ll O
be O
a O
hard O
battle O
but O
you O
have O
to O
fight O
to O
be O
that O
kind O
of O
person O
. O

Fucking O
yes O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
everyone O
on O
this O
subreddit O
needs O
physical O
affection O
. O

Ahh O
that O
s O
so O
great O
I O
ve O
been O
so O
scared O
about O
taking O
it O
but O
I O
guess O
I O
won O
t O
know O
until O
I O
give O
it O
a O
fair O
shot O
. O

I O
very O
negative O
one O

Not O
necessarily O
. O
Most O
natural O
groceries O
have O
a O
smoothie-ish O
type O
where O
you O
take O
a O
spoonful O
a O
day O
, O
and O
those O
are O
usually O
10-15 O
a O
month O
. O
I O
found O
some O
in O
pill O
form O
very O
similar O
blend O
of O
bacteria O
as O
the O
smoothie O
type O
that O
looked O
decent O
in O
my O
local O
natural O
grocery O
store O
s O
fridge O
section O
for O
like O
15 O
. O
My O
bf O
has O
been O
taking O
them O
too O
. O
After O
a O
couple O
days O
of O
taking O
them O
he O
s O
noticeably O
less O
gassy O
and O
seems O
to O
take O
less O
time O
in O
the O
bathroom O
. O
I O
dont O
normally O
have O
any O
digestive B-DIS
complaints I-DIS
as O
long O
as O
I O
take O
my O
meds O
, O
but O
have O
noticed O
my O
mood O
being O
better O
the O
last O
couple O
of O
days O
. O

Im O
sorry O
sounds O
veryyyy O
scary O
. O
I O
wish O
I O
could O
say O
i O
know O
how O
you O
feel O
but O
I O
dont O
. O
That O
sounds O
very O
stressful O
but O
i O
am O
here O
with O
you O
. O
I O
think O
you O
are O
fine O
with O
the O
amount O
of O
negative O
tests O
youve O
gotten O
back O
. O
Worst O
case O
scenerio O
You O
deal O
with O
it O
. O
There O
s O
millions O
of O
treatment O
options O
and O
more O
coming O
out O
everyday O
. O
Everything O
is O
going O
to O
be O
ok O
, O
i O
promise O
. O

Hmmm O
... O
what O
activities O
are O
most O
popular O
completely O
depends O
on O
the O
stage O
of O
dementia B-DIS
. O
We O
re O
a O
pretty O
big O
facility O
day O
care O
with O
approximately O
60 O
participants O
split O
into O
three O
levels O
, O
so O
our O
activities O
are O
setup O
accordingly O
. O
For O
the O
higher O
functioning O
people O
who O
I O
mainly O
work O
with O
, O
live O
music O
is O
probably O
the O
most O
popular O
, O
especially O
if O
there O
s O
dancing O
involved O
very O
common O
. O
Honestly O
, O
it O
s O
hard O
to O
say O
which O
activities O
have O
the O
best O
engagement O
since O
there O
s O
a O
lot O
of O
personal O
preference O
involved O
. O
Some O
people O
love O
the O
cognitive O
activities O
e.g O
. O
current O
event O
discussions O
, O
trivia O
games O
that O
we O
put O
together O
like O
Jeopardy O
amp O
; O
Wheel O
of O
Fortune O
, O
others O
prefer O
physical O
activities O
balloon O
volleyball O
is O
quite O
popular O
, O
and O
others O
prefer O
quieter O
creative O
and O
hands O
on O
things O
painting O
, O
gardening O
, O
etc O
. O
Interestingly O
, O
bingo O
is O
not O
that O
popular O
. O
We O
do O
it O
, O
but O
always O
as O
an O
alternate O
activity O
where O
my O
participants O
have O
a O
choice O
between O
two O
things O
and O
it O
usually O
only O
pulls O
6 O
or O
7 O
people O
out O
of O
the O
group O
of O
20-25 O
. O
One O
thing O
that O
is O
essential O
again O
for O
my O
group O
is O
that O
the O
level O
is O
set O
right O
. O
If O
the O
questions O
are O
too O
hard O
in O
Jeopardy O
people O
will O
tune O
out O
, O
if O
they O
re O
too O
easy O
they O
ll O
be O
bored O
and O
some O
really O
hate O
being O
given O
elementary O
school O
stuff O
. O
As O
you O
know O
it O
s O
hard O
to O
find O
the O
right O
balance O
, O
but O
I O
find O
a O
lot O
of O
that O
is O
accomplished O
by O
how O
you O
talk O
to O
your O
people O
. O
They O
are O
adults O
, O
so O
**always** O
talk O
to O
them O
like O
adults O
. O
Note O
that O
while O
I O
try O
to O
not O
ask O
a O
lot O
of O
questions O
that O
they O
can O
t O
answer O
, O
we O
often O
do O
activities O
that O
are O
essentially O
teaching O

activities O
such O
as O
biographical O
presentations O
or O
music O
and O
art O
appreciation O
, O
even O
though O
we O
know O
they O
won O
t O
retain O
much O
if O
any O
of O
the O
information O
. O
They O
love O
to O
learn O
and O
again O
, O
they O
love O
being O
treated O
as O
if O
they O
are O
highly O
educated O
many O
are O
, O
and O
highly O
functioning O
adults O
. O
Good O
luck O
and O
have O
fun O

I O
had O
a O
similar O
thing O
happen O
to O
me O
recently O
. O
She O
didn O
t O
know O
about O
my O
anxiety B-DIS
before O
. O
But O
she O
found O
out O
and O
then O
she O
told O
me O
I O
needed O
to O
work O
on O
myself O
before O
she O
could O
be O
with O
me O
. O
I O
know O
that O
s O
never O
going O
to O
happen O
. O
What O
helped O
me O
was O
being O
with O
her O
. O
When O
I O
was O
with O
her O
I O
gained O
so O
much O
confidence O
and O
strength O
and O
wanted O
to O
be O
better O
. O
Now O
I O
don O
t O
see O
the O
point O
. O
I O
worked O
so O
hard O
to O
be O
able O
to O
get O
a O
woman O
like O
her O
and O
then O
when O
I O
did O
it O
wasn O
t O
good O
enough O
. O

I O
m O
23 O
and O
with O
treatment O
my O
symptoms O
improved O
from O
being O
bedbound B-DIS
to O
leading O
quite O
a O
normal O
life O
and O
being O
able O
to O
work O
. O
Look O
at O
my O
past O
posts O
to O
see O
what O
I O
did O
as O
it O
s O
quite O
long O
. O
I O
was O
afraid O
I O
would O
never O
be O
able O
to O
work O
and O
have O
to O
go O
on O
disability O
. O

I O
use O
marijuana B-DRUG
to O
stimulate O
an O
appetite O
and O
curb O
the O
pain B-DIS
and O
nausea B-DIS
. O
It O
may O
be O
worth O
a O
try O
. O

Just O
FYI O
, O
a O
cytoscopy O
can O
t O
really O
diagnose O
IC O
, O
strictly O
speaking O
; O
it O
can O
only O
rule O
out O
other O
conditions O
like O
bladder O
cancer O
and O
or O
detect O
the O
presence O
of O
Hunner O
s O
lesions O
. O
Your O
experience O
is O
kind O
of O
similar O
to O
mine O
actually O
I O
have O
urgency O
primarily O
and O
for O
whatever O
reason O
junk O
food O
always O
seems O
to O
soothe O
my O
flares O
so O
I O
don O
t O
necessarily O
doubt O
that O
you O
have O
IC O
, O
but O
if O
your O
doctor O
isn O
t O
diagnosing O
IC O
properly O
it O
makes O
me O
wonder O
if O
they O
re O
treating O
you O
with O
all O
the O
appropriate O
modern O
options O
. O
What O
have O
you O
tried O
so O
far O
other O
than O
Elmiron O
, O
and O
has O
anything O
helped O
And O
for O
real O
, O
do O
a O
hardcore O
elimination O
diet O
like O
u O
hhhnnnnnggggggg O
suggested O
. O

Hes O
not O
very O
aware O
of O
his O
own O
emotions O
and O
will O
bottle O
things O
up O
until O
they O
explode O
, O
I O
don O
t O
believe O
hes O
seeking O
therapy O
and O
is O
probably O
in O
denial O
. O
Absolutely O
, O
that O
s O
what O
I O
m O
looking O
for O
to O
seek O
closure O
without O
having O
to O
deal O
with O
him O
I O
m O
on O
a O
waiting O
list O
for O
another O
therapist O
, O
but O
I O
thought O
in O
the O
meantime O
I O
d O
find O
out O
if O
anyone O
else O
in O
the O
community O
has O
experience O
. O

That O
is O
a O
great O
option O
I O
should O
have O
been O
more O
specific O
with O
my O
question O
. O
I O
am O
looking O
for O
more O
home O
remedies O
. O

A O
friend O
once O
told O
me O
a O
horror O
story O
about O
going O
to O
the O
ER O
low O
and O
having O
to O
sit O
there O
half O
an O
hour O
next O
to O
a O
coke O
machine O
, O
waiting O
on O
pharmacy O
to O
deliver O
the O
proper O
glucose O
drink O
. O
It O
was O
25 O
years O
ago O
so O
hopefully O
that O
wouldn O
t O
happen O
now O
. O
I O
ve O
never O
had O
to O
go O
further O
than O
the O
closest O
Icee O
vendor O
. O

what O
does O
it O
mean O
that O
you O
went O
to O
your O
parents O
robot O

Appreciate O
you O
sharing O

Thanks O
for O
the O
response O
. O
It O
s O
nice O
to O
know O
I O
m O
not O
alone O
, O
though O
it O
s O
sad O
to O
realize O
more O
people O
suffer O
like O
this O
. O
How O
do O
you O
know O
it O
s O
so O
common O

Derp O
. O
Just O
waking O
up O
lol O

It O
s O
extremely O
rare O
. O
I O
got O
re-tested O
in O
the O
hospital O
and O
I O
m O
still O
a O
confirmed O
type B-DIS

but O
my O
endocrinologist O
is O
treating O
me O
as O
one O
of O
her O
type B-DIS
1 I-DIS
patients O
. O
My O
experience O
was O
that O
I O
got O
super B-DIS
sick I-DIS
to I-DIS
my I-DIS
stomach I-DIS
, O
then O
started O
to O
feel O
winded O
even O
when O
i O
wasn O
t O
doing O
anything O
. O
Eyes B-DIS
started I-DIS
blurry I-DIS
and O
it O
felt O
like O
I O
was O
extremely O
intoxicated O
, O
but O
still O
very O
sick O
to O
my O
stomach O
. O

Yeah O
me O
too O
, O
my O
GPA B-DIS
is O
kind O
of O
fucked O
rn O
from O
being O
sick O
for O
2 O
years O
and O
trying O
to O
take O
full O
class O
loads O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
hospitalized O
11 O
times O
, O
but O
feel O
much O
better O
now O
than O
I O
ever O
have O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
should O
take O
it O
easy O
with O
my O
condition O
and O
all O

We O
have O
the O
humming B-DIS
while O
eating O
too O

I O
ve O
posted O
the O
story O
on O
all O
local O
news O
outlets O
social O
media O
, O
but O
I O
will O
call O
on O
Monday O
if O
I O
do O
not O
get O
a O
resolution O
from O
the O
actual O
Cracker O
Barrel O
. O
My O
boss O
just O
called O
the O
store O
after O
she O
read O
all O
of O
this O
on O
Facebook O
she O
s O
great O
. O
The O
manager O
was O
incredibly O
rude O
to O
her O
and O
said O
my O
grandfather O
had O
been O
sexually O
harassing O
his O
staff O
Seriously O
This O
is O
the O
first O
I O
ve O
heard O
of O
it O
and O
would O
not O
be O
allowed O
in O
anymore O
. O
She O
asked O
him O
if O
he O
understood O
dementia B-DIS
, O
but O
she O
says O
it O
sounds O
like O
he O
felt O
the O
actions O
were O
intentional O
. O
He O
eventually O
said O
he O
got O
that O
he O
had O
dementia B-DIS
, O
but O
then O
apparently O
got O
defensive O
when O
she O
said O
he O
was O
discriminating O
for O
a O
disability O
. O
I O
m O
so O
sorry O
if O
he O
was O
sexually O
harassing O
anyone O
, O
but O
we O
thought O
we O
had O
it O
cleared O
up O
and O
promised O
to O
only O
allow O
him O
to O
visit O
with O
someone O
else O
there O
He O
honestly O
doesn O
t O
know O
what O
s O
going O
on O
half O
the O
time O
anymore O
I O
will O
probably O
also O
file O
a O
state O
complaint O
with O
the O
Civil O
Rights O
Center O
. O

I O
m O
41 O
and O
was O
only O
diagnosed O
in O
my O
mid O
30 O
s O
your O
dr O
is O
wrong O

symptoms O

SUPPOSED O
to O
get O
better O
with O
age O
but O
if O
you O
are O
not O
diagnosed O
until O
late O
in O

you O
will O
not O
have O
gotten O
any O
chance O
to O

better O

in O
fact O
, O
mine O
got O
worse O
as O
i O
aged O
only O
some O

changed O

my O
anger B-DIS

The O

nice O
at O

We O

don O
t O

up O

I O
understand O
this O

A O
lot O
of O
the O
areas O
I O
look O
to O
this O
subreddit O
for O
help O
with O
and O
new O
techniques O
insight O
coping O
mechanisms O
are O
very O
triggering O
and O
reading O
about O
them O
causes O
my O
mind O
to O
flood O
with O
memories O
and O
thoughts O
and O
I O
can O
t O
even O
get O
to O
the O
comments O
about O
how O
to O
help O
xyz O
because O
I O
get O
so O
scared O
I O
close O
the O
tab O
before O
I O
freak O
out O
. O

I O
made O
a O
rant O
type O
post O
pretty O
much O
about O
this O
today O
. O
I O
took O
metamucil B-DRUG
this O
morning O
and O
ended O
up O
needing O
to O
leave O
work O
. O
So O
glad O
I O
m O
not O
the O
only O
one O

Because O
going O
through O
with O
it O
is O
worse O
than O
cancer B-DIS
. O
So O
much O
worse O
. O
It O
is O
or O
their O
own O
good O
. O
Their O
story O
is O
coming O
to O
a O
close O
and O
if O
the O
last O
chapters O
had O
a O
bit O
more O
editing O
it O
would O
be O
a O
better O
story O
. O

The O
feelings O
of O
depression B-DIS
vary O
. O
Some O
days O
it O
s O
emptiness B-DIS
and O
no B-DIS
emotions I-DIS
, O
other O
days O
it O
s O
a O
very B-DIS
deep I-DIS
and I-DIS
very I-DIS
painful I-DIS
longing I-DIS
for I-DIS
happiness I-DIS
and O
someone O
to O
share O
my O
life O
with O
. O

Yup O
, O
I O
plan O
to O
. O
In O
the O
meantime O
, O
there O
s O
a O
large O

Hi O
, O
I O
just O
got O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
small B-DIS
bowel I-DIS
crohns I-DIS
this O
week O
, O
the O
test O
the O
led O
me O
to O
the O
diagnosis O
was O
the O
pill O
camera O
, O
after O
more O
than O
a O
year O
of O
testing O
one O
little O
camera O
give O
me O
the O
answer O
to O
all O
my O
problems O
. O
I O
think O
after O
you O
can O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
crohns B-DIS
you O
can O
start O
on O
medications O
that O
hopefully O
help O
you O
a O
little O
bit O
better O
. O

Naltrexone B-DRUG
is O
used O
conventionally O
for O
opiate B-DIS
addictions I-DIS
since O
it O
blocks O
opioid O
receptors O
. O
Blocking O
the O
opioid O
receptors O
causes O
the O
body O
to O
upregulate O
endorphins O
. O
But O
this O
drug O
also O
blocks O
some O
receptor O
on O
microglial O
cells O
which O
are O
the O
primary O
immune O
cells O
of O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
and O
deactivates O
them O
. O
There O
are O
many O
anecdotal O
success O
stories O
of O
people O
using O
low O
dose O
naltrexone B-DRUG
to O
cure O
their O
cfs B-DIS
. O
I O
have O
not O
tried O
it O
myself O
. O
I O
have O
tried O
the O
glutathione B-DRUG
after O
being O
recommended O
to O
try O
it O
by O
a O
doctor O
but O
i O
haven O
t O
heard O
of O
many O
stories O
of O
people O
trying O
it O
. O
Glutathione B-DRUG
is O
the O
body O
s O
strongest O
antioxident O
and O
also O
boosts O
the O
immune O
system O
as O
it O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
increase O
NK O
cell O
activity O
. O
This O
is O
interesting O
because O
several O
studies O
have O
found O
low O
NK O
activity O
in O
cfs B-DIS
patients O
and O
some O
argue O
it O
can O
be O
used O
for O
diagnosis O
. O
Ive O
only O
been O
trying O
liposomal B-DRUG
glutathione I-DRUG
for O
2 O
weeks O
now O
and O
have O
felt O
a O
little O
improvement O
. O
Its O
unfortunately O
freakin O
expensive O
and O
we O
cfs B-DIS
patients O
are O
naturally O
poor O
. O

gt O
; O
I O
m O
going O
to O
suggest O
that O
you O
might O
be O
asking O
the O
wrong O
question O
. O
OK. O
gt O
; O
Whatever O
is O
troubling O
you O
seems O
to O
improve O
when O
your O
emotional O
state O
improves O
. O
Yes O
; O
correct O
gt O
; O
This O
is O
important O
, O
and O
it O
suggests O
a O
way O
forward O
. O
However O
, O
it O
does O
not O
really O
say O
much O
about O
where O
the O
issue O
began O
, O
or O
how O
to O
categorize O
it O
. O
Illnesses O
can O
have O
a O
physical O
origin O
and O
remain O
subclinical O
no O
noticeable O
signs O
or O
symptoms O
, O
only O
to O
blossom O
under O
stress O
. O
They O
can O
be O
imagined O
, O
too O
, O
and O
they O
can O
be O
anywhere O
in O
between O
. O
It O
s O
an O
arbitrary O
point O
that O
is O
of O
little O
consequence O
. O
My O
illness O
began O
shortly O
before O
my O
finals O
at O
the O
start O
of O
December O
I O
was O
able O
to O
successfully O
do O
my O
finals O
, O
though O
; O
basically O
, O
I O
didn O
t O
get O
enough O
sleep O
one O
night O
and O
then O
by O
the O
next O
evening O
I O
literally O
felt O
so O
exhausted B-DIS
that O
I O
couldn O
t O
eat O
; O
plus O
, O
I O
also O
developed O
*extremely* O
massive B-DIS
head I-DIS
pains I-DIS
that O
evening O
though O
my O
MRI O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
later O
came O
back O
normal O
, O
according O
to O
my O
doctor O
. O
gt O
; O
What O
does O
matter O
is O
discovering O
how O
to O
make O
things O
better O
, O
and O
you O
have O
an O
important O
finding O
to O
help O
determine O
that O
. O
You O
haven O
t O
mentioned O
anxiety B-DIS
as O
an O
issue O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
to O
make O
an O
effort O
to O
calm O
yourself O
down O
that O
certainly O
seems O
like O
a O
possibility O
. O
Have O
you O
got O
to O
the O
bottom O
of O
that O
, O
and O
sought O
treatment O
for O
it O
Frankly O
, O
I O
certainly O
think O
that O
I O
have O
anxiety B-DIS
; O
indeed O
, O
I O
have O
been O
taking O
anti-anxiety B-DRUG
medications I-DRUG
for O
several O
years O
by O
now O
. O
gt O
; O
After O
surviving O
a O
bout O
of O
anxiety B-DIS
myself O
I O
can O
attest O
to O
how O
much O
better O
life O

is O
once O
you O
can O
put O
most O
of O
that O
stuff O
behind O
you O
. O
OK O
; O
understood O
. O

Yes O
they O
do O
, O
and O
I O
also O
worry O
about O
getting O
EOAD B-DIS
myself O
. O
No O
history O
that O
I O
am O
aware O
of O
, O
her O
father O
and O
brother O
died O
young O
of O
cancers B-DIS

Her O
mom O
had O
a O
stroke B-DIS

died O
suddenly O
was O
in O
her O
80s O

Her O
uncle O
just O
passed O
away O
recently O
age O
90 O
and O
he O
did O
not O
have O
AD B-DIS

Other O

I O
am O
not O

I O
don O
t O
know O
any O
health O

about O
her O

What O
about O
you- O
history O
there O

The O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
ginger B-DRUG
gravol I-DRUG
is O
a O
blessing O
when O
the O
nausea B-DIS
hits O
. O
It O
does O
help O
settle O
your O
stomach O
faster O
and O
helps O
you O
get O
over O
the O
attack O
a O
little O
better O
. O
Hope O
you O
are O
feeling O
better O
by O
now O
. O

Hyperthyroid O
as O
defined O
by O
low B-DIS
TSH I-DIS
and O
true O
hyperthyroid B-DIS
are O
different O
things O
. O
If O
you O
rely O
on O
TSH O
, O
as O
contemporary O
medicine O
does O
, O
you O
reach O
such O
unteneable O
conclusions O
as O
sometimes O
hypo O
and O
sometimes O
hyper O
. O
Op O
should O
go O
by O
temperature O
, O
pulse O
, O
and O
symptoms O
and O
ignore O
the O
ignorant O
reliance O
on O
TSH O
. O

I O
don O
t O
want O
to O
try O
anymore O
. O
The O
effects O
of O
my O
hard O
work O
are O
going O
to O
be O
completely O
destroyed O
by O
one O
week O

lethargy B-DIS

I O
don O
t O
feel O
that O
there O

any O
point O

for O
my O
freshman O
year O
, O
I O
got O
sick O
with O
what O
I O
thought O
was O
just O
a O
mild B-DIS
stomach I-DIS
virus I-DIS
. O
But O
, O
I O
never O
got O
better O
. O
I O
was O
constantly B-DIS
feeling I-DIS
sick I-DIS
, O
and O
even O
landed O
myself O
in O
the O
ER O
twice O
. O
My O
GI O
says O
it O
s O
post-viral B-DIS
gastroparesis I-DIS
and O
that O
over O
time O
it O
should O
lessen O
. O
I O
definitely O
have O
flare B-DIS
ups I-DIS
in O
addition O
to O
the O
regular O
persistent O
symptoms O
. O
Like O
everyone O
else O
here O
, O
changing O
my O
diet O
really O
helped O
me O
. O
I O
m O
currently O
on O
a O
low O
residue O
diet O
, O
and O
I O
also O
don O
t O
eat O
fatty O
greasy O
foods O
or O
dairy O
or O
tomato O
. O
All O
of O
those O
are O
triggers O
for O
me O
. O
I O
also O
suffer O
from O
a O
terrible O
mix O
of O
constipation B-DIS
from O
lack O
of O
fiber O
and O
intermittent B-DIS
periods I-DIS
of I-DIS
diarrhea I-DIS
just O
because O
. O
So O
, O
if O
you O
do O
change O
your O
diet O
, O
watch O
your O
bm O
s O
. O

I O
was O
taking O
it O
before O
bed O
too O
but O
I O
stopped O
because O
it O
was O
altering B-DIS
my I-DIS
period I-DIS
, O
making B-DIS
my I-DIS
face I-DIS
break I-DIS
out I-DIS
in I-DIS
pimples I-DIS
, O
and O
causing B-DIS
hair I-DIS
loss I-DIS
. O
Something O
you O
might O
try O
is O
iberogas B-DRUG
, O
it O
s O
super O
bitter O
and O
taste O
horrid O
but O
it O
can O
trigger O
your O
stomach O
to O
empty O
even O
after O
you O
ve O
had O
food O
. O
It O
s O
all O
natural O
herbs O
and O
I O
m O
at O
the O
point O
where O
I O
know O
it O
ll O
help O
so O
I O
take O
it O
without O
getting O
grossed O
out O
. O
I O
think O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
problem O
is O
that O
even O
when O
there O
s O
no O
food O
in O
my O
stomach O
, O
my O
stomach O
is O
producing O
acid O
while O
I O
sleep O
which O
is O
causing O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
which O
causes O
me O
to O
be O
nauseated B-DIS
. O
My O
doctor O
recommended O
elevating O
the O
headboard O
by O
4-6 O
inches O
. O
I O
tried O
that O
but O
honestly O
, O
if O
there O
was O
a O
way O
for O
me O
to O
sleep O
while O
standing O
that O
would O
probably O
fix O
my O
sleeping O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
issues O
lol O
Hope O
this O
helps O

why O
does O
she O
want O
to O

I O
thought O
about O
that O
, O
but O
I O
don O
t O
think O
it O
s O
likely O
. O
When O
I O
did O
have O
close O
friends O
, O
I O
occasionally O
worried O
that O
they O
disliked O
me O
due O
to O
my O
unpredictable B-DIS
emotions I-DIS
, O
but O
I O
was O
never O
worried O
about O
anyone O
abandoning O
me O
. O
Conversations O
with O
others O
just O
feel O
incredibly O
dull O
and O
scripted O
, O
and O
I O
find O
that O
I O
have O
trouble O
relating O
to O
most O
people O
. O

I O
ve O
never O
tested O
positive O
for O
thrush B-DIS
, O
only O
bv O
. O
My O
doctor O
ran O
a O
full O
hormone O
test O
on O
me O
because O
I O
demanded O
it O
. O
My O
sister O
has O
PCOS B-DIS
. O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
sure O
that O
wasn O
t O
contributing O
to O
my O
problems O
. O
She O
said O
my O
testosterone O
is O
normal O
. O
When O
I O
asked O
about O
my O
estrogen O
and O
progesterone O
levels O
, O
she O
said O
that O
levels O
don O
t O
matter O
for O
those O
two O
hormones O
. O
It O
only O
matters O
that O
they O
re O
in O
balance O
, O
and O
they O
are O
. O
That O
doesn O
t O
seem O
entirely O
right O
to O
me O
, O
but O
I O
m O
not O
a O
medical O
professional O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
a O
few O
blood O
tests O
done O
, O
but O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
if O
I O
ve O
been O
tested O
for O
insulin B-DIS
resistance I-DIS
or O
diabetes B-DIS
. O
I O
ll O
bring O
it O
up O
the O
next O
time O
I O
see O
her O
as O
well O
as O
ask O
about O
the O
lump B-DIS
thing I-DIS
. O
I O
really O
appreciate O
your O
thoughtful O
response O
. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
other O
suggestions O
or O
insights O
, O
I O
m O
all O
ears O
. O

Thanks O
Can O
you O
elaborate O
a O
little O
bit O
on O
this O

I O
got O
tested O
for O
ureaplasma B-DIS
mycoplasma B-DIS
all O
came O
out O
negative O
. O
It O
s O
gotten O
better O
over O
time O
, O
but O
I O
can O
feel O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
pelvic I-DIS
floor I-DIS
muscles I-DIS
nowdays O
so O
I O
ve O
actually O
been O
trying O
to O
exercise O
more O
, O
use O
heat O
pads O
and O
try O
to O
do O
therawand O
at O
home O
cause O
physical O
therapy O
essentially O
was O
a O
person O
therawanding O
me O
with O
their O
fingers O
and O
charging O
200 O
a O
visit O
. O
not O
fully O
cured O
but O
it O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
pelvic B-DIS
floor I-DIS
issue I-DIS
, O
probably O
due O
to O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
sit O
on O
my O
ass O
all O
day O
. O
hopefully O
exercise O
and O
my O
own O
physical O
therapy O
will O
get O
me O
back O
to O
100 O
sooner O
or O
later O
. O

Can O
you O
swing O
an O
extra O
20 O
month O
Test O
strips O
for O
my O
backup O
meter O
go O
for O
19.99 O
for O
100 O
on O
Amazon O
. O
It O
s O
a O
Glucocard B-DRUG
Vital I-DRUG
, O
and O
I O
want O
to O
say O
the O
meter O
itself O
was O
15 O
or O
so O
. O
That O
would O
let O
you O
test O
three O
times O
a O
day O
on O
its O
own O
, O
plus O
extras O
and O
whatever O
your O
insurance O
covers O
. O
You O
could O
do O
the O
Walmart O
route O
, O
too O
, O
but O
the O
price O
for O
strips O
for O
their O
cheapest O
meter O
is O
about O
the O
same O
. O

Thank O
you O
, O
this O
is O
very O
sound O
advice O
and O
it O
helps O
putting O
things O
in O
perspective O

Mine O
was O
4.3 O
and O
my O
body B-DIS
temperature I-DIS
was I-DIS
96 I-DIS
daily I-DIS
. O
Most O
other O
symptoms O
were O
more O
subjective O
and O
the O
doctor O
could O
explain O
them O
away O
, O
but O
the O
body B-DIS
temperature I-DIS
was I-DIS
just I-DIS
weird I-DIS
. O
A O
small O
dose O
of O
t3 B-DRUG
put O
it O
back O
in O
the O
98s O
. O
Most O
symptoms O
disappeared O
within O
a O
week O
. O

Not O
many O
of O
us O
hanging O
brain O
out O
here O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
this O
sub O
should O
have O
flairs O
for O
gender O
- O
I O
usually O
don O
t O
like O
that O
idea O
, O
but O
men O
and O
women O
have O
such O
different O
experiences O
with O
IC O
. O
Someone O
giving O
advice O
in O
a O
comment O
might O
not O
work O
for O
the O
opposite O
gender O
, O
and O
it O
s O
usually O
hard O
to O
tell O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
advice O

Thanks O
for O
sharing O
this O
- O
a O
very O
interesting O
read O
. O

I O
totally O
understand O
about O
alarm B-DIS
fatigue I-DIS
and O
over O
correcting O
on O
the O
abundance O
of O
data O
. O
So O
far O
the O
awesome O
settings O
in O
xdrip O
have O
really O
reduced O
the O
unnecessary O
ones O
I O
d O
say O
my O
annoyance O
factor O
went O
down O
by O
75 O
. O

Having O
a O
long O
history O
of O
UTI O
symptoms O
with O
no O
bacteria O
, O
coupled O
with O
an O
especially O
bad B-DIS
food I-DIS
trigger I-DIS
got O
me O
diagnosed O
. O
I O
ate O
a O
spicy O
chicken O
and O
pineapple O
dish O
and O
found O
myself O
in O
a O
new O
doctor O
s O
office O
new O
to O
me O
anyway O
, O
my O
regular O
was O
out O
that O
day O
and O
she O
looked O
at O
my O
history O
, O
I O
told O
her O
this O
happens O
every O
time O
I O
eat O
something O
spicy O
or O
acidic O
, O
I O
had O
some O
other O
tests O
done O
to O
rule O
out O
other O
possibilities O
pelvic O
exam O
, O
STI O
tests O
and O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
IC B-DIS
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
asking O
for O
a O
ureaplasma B-DIS
test O
, O
because O
I O
ve O
read O
on O
numerous O
sites O
that O
the O
symptoms O
of O
a O
ureaplasma B-DIS
infection I-DIS
are O
so O
similar O
to O
IC O
that O
they O
re O
nearly O
indistinguishable O
from O
one O
another O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O

That O
is O
a O
very O
insightful O
response O
. O

I O
don O
t O
have O
any O
money O
right O
now O
, O
and O
no O
insurance O
, O
at O
least O
the O
ER O
would O
be O
something O
I O
could O
pay O
for O
later O
is O
my O
thinking O
unless O
this O
is O
something O
I O
can O
still O
pass O
on O
my O
own O
. O

I O
m O
wondering O
what O
Blautix B-DRUG
is O
The O
exceptional O
efforts O
of O
our O
team O
have O
potentially O
opened O
the O
way O
for O
a O
point O
of O
care O
diagnostic O
for O
IBS B-DIS
, O
and O
provided O
the O
means O
to O
monitor O
our O
therapeutic O
intervention O
Blautix B-DRUG
, O
our O
clinical O
stage O
programme O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
IBS B-DIS
. O
The O
best O
I O
ve O
found O
so O
far O
is O
this O
blurb O
from O
their O
website O
Our O
live O
biotherapeutics O
are O
strains O
of O
gut O
bacteria O
that O
have O
been O
isolated O
from O
healthy O
human O
donors O
. O
They O
are O
taken O
orally O
as O
a O
capsule O
and O
travel O
to O
the O
gut O
where O
they O
exert O
their O
therapeutic O
effect O
. O
Since O
they O
are O
strains O
which O
are O
naturally O
found O
in O
the O
human O
intestine O
, O
they O
are O
considered O
to O
be O
very O
safe O
. O

Most O
people O
just O
don O
t O
understand O
depression B-DIS
unfortunately O

done O
thank O
you O

Chips O
, O
a O
bag O
of O
gluten-free O

I O
liked O
backpacking O
up O
until O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
and O
it O
wasn O
t O
easy O
bit O
at O
least O
I O
was O
out O
in O
the O
woods O
. O
Now O
my O
husband O
and O
I O
are O
getting O
into O
car O
camping O
. O
I O
bought O
a O
portable O
potty O
for O
inside O
the O
vestbule O
of O
the O
tent O
. O

I O
ve O
only O
been O
T1 B-DIS
for O
a O
year O
and O
a O
half O
. O
I O
ll O
be O
trying O
a O
few O
different O
things O
now O
that O
I O
m O
awake O
, O
alive O
, O
and O
a O
little O
more O
level-headed O
this O
morning O
. O
Sorry O
my O
post O
is O
so O
negative O
I O
think O
I O
got O
some O
Honeymoon O
Help O
last O
night O
as O
my O
BS O
dropped O
like O
a O
rock O
right O
after O
my O
post O
and O
was O
constantly O
100-110 O
from O
11 O
30p O
- O
8a O
this O
morning O
, O
and O
I O
can O
start O
the O
day O
fresh O
. O
I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
ve O
got O
T1.5 O
because O
I O
m O
still O
really O
sensitive O
to O
Insulin B-DRUG
outside O
of O
mealtimes O
, O
but O
during O
after O
meals O
in O
the O
evening O
is O
when O
I O
m O
having O
problems O
, O
and O
it O
s O
been O
going O
on O
for O
a O
while O
. O
Daytime O
morning O
meals O
usually O
go O
fine O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
tips O
, O
I O
m O
in O
a O
little O
better O
of O
a O
place O
now O
, O
and O
can O
actually O
start O
working O
on O
it O
. O

I O
would O
absolutely O
say O
this O
is O
the O
right O
decision O
. O
There O
are O
a O
TON O
of O
health O
benefits O
from O
sun O
light O
. O
Circadian O
rhythm O
is O
huge O
, O
increase O
in O
atp O
production O
red O
amp O
; O
IR O
is O
big O
, O
uv O
light O
has O
been O
shown O
to O
help O
the O
immune O
system O
, O
etc O
. O
You O
feel O
good O
when O
you O
get O
out O
in O
sunlight O
as O
it O
helps O
make O
and O
release O
hormones O
. O
Despite O
what O
guy O
above O
is O
saying O
, O
humans O
are O
absolutely O
designed O
to O
be O
in O
sun O
light O
all O
day O
. O
There O
are O
studies O
coming O
out O
showing O
people O
who O
tan O
regularly O
in O
the O
sun O
are O
half O
as O
likey O
to O
die O
as O
those O
who O
don O
t. O
We O
evolved O
white O
skin O
to O
allow O
more O
light O
to O
prenetrate O
deeper O
past O
the O
skin O
and O
into O
blood O
organs O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
the O
time O
I O
find O
that O
patients O
cooperate O
super O
well O
with O
strangers O
but O
not O
with O
their O
family O
, O
so O
it O
s O
worth O
a O
go O
. O
They O
can O
help O
with O
things O
like O
washing O
, O
meals O
, O
getting O
dressed O
. O
Personal O
care O
type O
things O
. O
They O
can O
also O
just O
sit O
and O
chat- O
or O
if O
you O
need O
to O
pop O
out O
there O
s O
sitters O
that O
can O
keep O
your O
grandpa O
safe O
and O
comfortable O
until O
you O
get O
back O
. O
Definitely O
worth O
looking O
into O
. O

My O
husband O
did O
a O
search O
and O
found O
this O
- O

We O
went O
through O
a O
similar O
situation O
with O
my O
dad O
right O
after O
he O
was O
diagnosed O
. O
He O
was O
let O
go O
from O
his O
job O
and O
refusing O
to O
believe O
his O
diagnosis O
was O
as O
severe O
as O
it O
actually O
was O
and O
so O
he O
updated O
his O
linked O
in O
and O
starting O
contacting O
recruiters O
. O
We O
talked O
to O
him O
about O
it O
but O
he O
refused O
to O
listen O
to O
us O
. O
He O
even O
started O
forgetting O
his O
passwords O
so O
he O
made O
new O
emails O
and O
started O
the O
process O
all O
over O
again O
but O
around O
that O
time O
he O
also O
started O
mismanaging O
his O
money O
like O
transferring O
all O
his O
savings O
into O
my O
brothers O
checking O
account O
and O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O
My O
mom O
finally O
changed O
all O
the O
passwords O
on O
the O
computers O
and O
told O
him O
he O
couldn O
t O
do O
that O
anymore O
. O
I O
hate O
to O
admit O
it O
but O
our O
solution O
was O
to O
give O
him O
an O
iPad O
that O
he O
didn O
t O
know O
the O
iCloud O
password O
to O
so O
he O
couldn O
t O
use O
it O
to O
download O
new O
apps O
and O
contact O
people O
. O
He O
mostly O
uses O
it O
to O
play O
games O
and O
read O
the O
news O
and O
he O
isn O
t O
thrilled O
but O
as O
his O
disease O
has O
gotten O
worse O
he O
has O
slowly O
begun O
to O
accept O
his O
limitations O
. O
He O
is O
still O
frustrated O
by O
it O
but O
less O
upset O
about O
us O
treating O
him O
like O
child O
. O
It O
may O
not O
be O
the O
best O
solution O
but O
it O
certainly O
helped O
us O
. O

Ugh O
, O
when O
you O

One O
thing O
to O

is O
that O
in O

The O
trick O
is O
using O
the O
soft O
taco O
size O
instead O
of O
the O
full O
burrito O
size O
; O
Their O
whole O
wheat O
ones O
are O
also O
pretty O
good O
and O
have O
fewer O
carbs O
. O
They O
also O
have O
a O
Carb O
balance O
variety O
which O
I O
think O
we O
tried O
once O
, O
but O
generally O
I O
prefer O
the O
whole O
wheat O
ones O
. O

Also O
, O
not O
clear O
if O
my O

caused O
by O

There O
is O
very O
good O
reason O
to O
suspect O
a O
philanthropist O
would O
donate O
to O
ME O
over O
endo B-DIS
and O
any O
other O
condition O
. O
See O

The O
downside O
to O
trying O
it O
is O
just O
that O
it O
cuts O
out O
so O
many O
foods O
, O
especially O
when O
eating O
out O
which O
, O
in O
fairness O
, O
I O
rarely O
do O
. O
My O
diet O
is O
already O
fairly O
low-carb O
, O
but O
I O
haven O
t O
completely O
cut O
out O
gluten O
or O
sugar O
mostly O
in O
sauces O
and O
fruits O
. O
How O
militant O
did O
your O
endo O
say O
to O
be O
about O
those O
things O
Is O
it O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
avoiding O
overt O
sources O
, O
or O
do O
you O
have O
to O
check O
every O
sauce O
and O
item O
you O
buy O
for O
hidden O
gluten O
or O
sugar O
This O
is O
even O
worse O
with O

, O
but O
I O
m O
assuming O

didn O

eliminating O
that O
to O
you O

I O
got O
them O

when O
my O

I O

My O

high I-DIS
before O

, O
and O
I O
m O
sure O
I O
was O
dehydrated B-DIS

All O

I O
thought O
I O
could O

here O

I O
ve O
been O
flaring B-DIS
up I-DIS
so O
much O
these O
past O
2 O
weeks O

And O
I O
think O
strawberries O
are O
to O

. O
Does O
anyone O
know O
if O
strawberries O
could O
flare B-DIS
you O
up O

I O
can O
really O
relate O
to O
this O
. O
Everything B-DIS
seems I-DIS
monstrously I-DIS
enormous I-DIS
- O
like O
the O
world O
will O
end O
. O
The O
truth O
I O
suspect O
is O
that O
I O
just O
have O
to O
do O
a O
few O
simple O
things O
to O
solve O
my O
problems O
. O
The O
regret O
that O
comes O
from O
not O
having O
done O
this O
sooner O
, O
thus O
preventing O
me O
from O
being O
in O
the O
position O
I O
m O
in O
now O
, O
makes O
this O
even O
harder O
, O
and O
then O
my O
thoughts O
say O
it O
s O
too O
late O
... O
Then O
the O
fear B-DIS
and I-DIS
panic I-DIS
and I-DIS
anxiety I-DIS
comes O
in O

and O
like O
you O
said O

Well O
thats O
the O
now O
, O
but O
I O
was O
talking O
about O
years O
after O
burn O
out O
. O
If O
the O
shots O
preserve O
some O
of O
the O
hearing O
that O
would O
have O
been O
lost O
with O
out O
them O
. O
aka O
if O
you O
never O
had O
the O
shots O
would O
you O
end O
up O
more O
deaf B-DIS
down O
the O
road O
. O

Would O
be O
interested O
to O
know O
, O
but O
where O
I O
live O
they O
won O
t O
test O
you O
unless O
you O
have O
GI B-DIS
or O
a O
few O
other O
conditions O

Everybody O
here O

it O

My O

talks O
about O
going O
back O

familiar O
places O
where O
he O
remembers O
being O
in O
charge O

things O
. O
I O
can O
easily O
understand O
wanting O
that O
, O
but O
he O
won O
t O
be O
able O
to O
go O
there O
and O
even O
if O
he O
could O
he O
would O
not O
have O
the O
ability O
he O
once O
had O
- O
and O
things O
always O
change O
so O
it O
won O
t O
be O
the O
same O
. O
That O
said O
, O
if O
they O
have O
to O
move O
somewhere O
new O
, O
I O
think O
it O
s O
better O
to O
do O
that O
while O
he O
can O
still O
make O
new O
memories O
. O

Oh O
my O
gosh O
this O
is O
scary O

I O
don O

we O

I O
m O
so O

he O
can O

I O
m O
not O
looking O

his O

I O
thought O
Tysabri B-DRUG
was O
a O
second-line O

if O

third-line O
, O
treatment O
though O
Why O
should O
someone O
who O
is O
not O
experiencing O
every O

symptoms O
, O
and O
who O
has O
very O
few O
lesions B-DIS
use O
Tysabri B-DRUG
Isn O
t O
it O
very O
dangerous O
I O
m O
surprised O

he O
even O
has O
the O
option O
to O
go O
for O
Tysabri B-DRUG
. O

I O
ll O
bet O
you O
re O
female O
. O
When O
progesterone O
increases O
there O
is O
an O
increased O
response O
to O
thyroid O
hormone O
. O
Progesterone O
opposes O
estrogen O
so O
there O
can O
be O
periods O
of O
brief O
remission O
corresponding O
to O
the O
menstrual O
cycle O
, O
and O
also O
there O
can O
be O
periods B-DIS
of I-DIS
high I-DIS
cortisol I-DIS
that O
is O
commonly O
mistaken O
for O
hyperthyroidism B-DIS
, O
but O
is O
not O
, O
because O
thyroid O
hormone O
opposes O
cortisol O
. O
Tsh O
was O
standardized O
from O
a O
1950s O
test O
called O
protein-bound O
iodide O
, O
which O
defined O
the O
hypothyroid B-DIS
population O
as O
5 O
based O
on O
iodide O
. O
It O
was O
presumed O
to O
be O
accurate O
but O
was O
not O
, O
so O
tsh O
came O
to O
the O
market O
in O
the O
1970s O
, O
but O
tsh O
was O
standardized O
on O
protein-bound O
iodide O
. O
Both O
tests O
vastly O
underestinate O
the O
hypothyroid B-DIS
population O
, O
for O
example O
previous O
data O
, O
using O
capnometry O
, O
defined O
the O
american O
hypothyroid O
populationbas O
slightly O
over O
40 O
. O
Tsh O
varies O
between O
labs O
, O
it O
varies O
diurnally O
, O
it O
varies O
in O
response O
to O
things O
such O
as O
cortisol O
and O
caffeine B-DRUG
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
it O
is O
continually O
adjusted O
upwards O
on O
downards O
, O
for O
example O
it O
was O
increased O
again O
for O
pregnant O
women O
after O
being O
decreased O
a O
couppe O
of O
times O
since O
the O
year O
2000 O
. O
It O
is O
an O
unreliable O
indicator O
, O
and O
i O
repeat O
that O
a O
low O
tsh O
doesnt O
necessarily O
signify O
hypothyroidism B-DIS
. O
As O
to O
your O
contention O
that O
thyroidectomy B-DIS
is O
rare O
in O
hashimoto O
s O
, O
doctors O
do O
remove O
or O
ablate O
the O
thyroid O
in O
error O
, O
so O
it O
is O
prudent O
to O
caution O
against O
. O

I O
ve O
never O
heard O
of O
it O
, O
but O
the O
sleep O
connection O
is O
suggestive O
. O
My O
POTS B-DIS
symptoms O
are O
a O
zillion O
times O
worse O
if O
I O
ve O
had O
less O
than O
7 O
hours O

sleep O
. O

No O

difference O

Hang O

. O

I O
got O
a O
heated O
mattress O
pad O
just O
for O
this O
reason O
. O
I O
heat O
it O
up O
about O
an O
hour O
before O
bedtime O
and O
wake O
up O
creaky O
but O
functional O
. O
The O
rest O
works O
out O
as O
I O
move O
around O
. O
Won O
t O
work O
for O
everyone O
, O
but O
it O
helps O
me O
a O
ton O
. O

So O
three O
days O
ago O
you O
went O
on O
and O
on O
about O
how O
you O
don O
t O
trust O
doctors O
and O
had O
lots O
of O
reasons O
based O
on O
your O
experiences O
. O
Why O
should O
I O
trust O
a O
doctor O
the O
family O
had O
never O
met O
after O
a O
15 O
minute O
assessment O
While O
I O
respect O
some O
of O
the O
responses O
I O
ve O
gotten O
from O
other O
people O
, O
I O
think O
you O
re O
full O
of O
shit O
. O

Im O
a O
bit O
confused O
at O
what O
your O
saying O
, O
are O
you O
saying O
the O
doctors O
will O
say O
it O
s O
ET B-DIS
even O
if O
it O
isn O
t O
maybe O
im O
mis-reading O
your O
comment O
. O
Did O
you O
end O
up O
having O
PD B-DIS
even O
though O
you O
were O
diagnosed O
with O
ET B-DIS

All O
the O
yes O
. O

I O
have O
mitral B-DIS
valve I-DIS
prolapse I-DIS
, O
but O
that O
s O
really O
common O
. O
I O
*think* O
I O
get O
occasional O
mitral B-DIS
valve I-DIS
regurgitations I-DIS
, O
but O
they O
re O
so O
rare O
I O
can O
only O
go O
by O
other O
people O
s O
descriptions O
of O
how O
it O
feels O
. O
Anyway O
, O
that O
s O
not O
much O
concern O
- O
it O
s O
really O
common O
. O
Otherwise O
just O
tachycardia B-DIS
. O
IST B-DIS
is O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
exclusion O
, O
so O
basically O
, O
they O
have O
to O
check O
you O
for O
every O
possible O
thing O
that O
could O
cause O
tachycardia B-DIS
before O
settling O
on O
IST B-DIS
. O
So O
, O
we O
did O
stress O
tests O
, O
echocardiograms O
, O
24hr O
holter O
monitors O
, O
etc O
. O
I O
have O
a O
normal O
rhythm O
, O
it O
s O
just O
fast O
. O
My O
palpitations B-DIS
don O
t O
show O
up O
on O
EKG O
or O
anything O
. O
Everything O
is O
fine O
, O
my O
heart O
just O
goes O
too O
fast O
, O
which O
is O
exhausting O
and O
uncomfortable O
. O
I O
recently O
started O
checking O
my O
BP O
regularly O
and O
have O
found O
it O
s O
generally O
low O
no O
surprise O
there O
. O
Over O
the O
past O
few O
days O
it O
s O
usually O
in O
the O
90 O
s O
60 O
s O
range O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
a O
few O
readings O
with O
diastolic O
in O
the O
50s O
. O
My O
heart O
rate O
is O
usually O
in O
the O
80s-90s O
, O
but O
if O
I O
m O
up O
and O
moving O
, O
it O
can O
be O
in O
the O
120s O
. O
Getting O
ready O
in O
the O
mornings O
or O
doing O
anything O
strenuous O
which O
would O
probably O
include O
taking O
the O
stairs O
, O
but O
I O
avoid O
stairs O
like O
the O
plague O
... O
it O
jumps O
into O
the O
150s O
. O
It O
also O
doesn O
t O
really O
settle O
down O
well O
once O
I O
m O
sitting O
. O
I O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
recover O
, O
it O
seems O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
dysautonomia B-DIS
yet O
, O
but O
with O
the O
IST B-DIS
and O
possible O
contributory O
POTS B-DIS
, O
plus O
all O
the O
typical B-DIS
autonomic I-DIS
issues I-DIS
, O
I O
m O
fairly O
certain O
this O
is O
all O
connected O
. O
Also O
, O

to O
clarify O
, O
my O
major O
easily O
identified O
symptoms O
started O
in O
early O
2010 O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
been O
going O
to O
doctors O
for O
related O
symptoms O
since O
I O
was O
a O
teen O
about O
to O
turn O
28 O
. O
Maybe O
before O
that O
, O
even O
. O
So O
for O
me O
, O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
more O
of O
a O
life-long O
, O
good O
years O
bad O
years O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O
I O
ve O
just O
had O
primarily O
bad O
years O
since O
2010 O
. O
I O
don O
t O
really O
have O
an O
old O
life O
to O
get O
back O
, O
so O
it O
s O
more O
about O
dealing O
with O
it O
and O
optimizing O
what O
I O
can O
do O
. O

Interesting O
At O
87 O
if O
it O
helps O
her O
, O
all O
the O
better O
It O
not O
only O
is O
an O
opiate O
, O
but O
will O
increase O
serotonin O
. O
So O
you O
feel O
good O
, O
as O
long O
as O
she O
doesn O
t O
over O
do O
it O
. O
Catch O
is O
over O
time O
the O
brain O
adjust O
to O
the O
medication O
, O
so O
she O
may O
need O
a O
higher O
dose O
to O
maintain O
that O
happiness O
. O
My O
biggest O
issues O
with O
any O
opiate O
is O
it O
shuts O
down O
my O
colon O
. O
I O
can O
not O
take O
pain O
killers O
as O
I O
no B-DIS
longer I-DIS
poop I-DIS
Everything O
backs O
up O
, O
and O
so O
my O
Sinemet B-DRUG
never O
makes O
it O
to O
my O
little O
intestine O
where O
is O
needs O
to O
be O
absorbed O
. O
Thankfully O
I O
can O
chew O
up O
a O
levodopa B-DRUG
carbidopa B-DRUG
tablet I-DRUG
best O
is O
to O
chew O
one O
up O
and O
take O
with O
orange O
juice O
to O
help O
get O
things O
moving O
again O
. O
Give O
her O
my O
best O
. O

Thanks O
for O
doing O
this O
. O
My O
mother O
is O
65 O
and O
also O
has O
LBD B-DIS
. O
I O
m O
glad O
you O
re O
raising O
awareness O
because O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
assume O
Alzheimer O
s O
is O
the O
only O
type O
of O
dementia B-DIS
. O
Staging O
with O
LBD B-DIS
is O
notoriously O
hard O
to O
predict O
. O
Wishing O
you O
and O
your O
mom O
all O
the O
best O
. O

High O
fructose O
corn O
syrup O
is O
bad O
onion O
and O
garlic O
are O
bad O
. O
Gluten O
is O
a O
trigger O
for O
some O
people O
as O
well O
as O
dairy O
. O
Everyone O
is O
different O
though O
. O
Keep O
in O
mind O
as O
well O
onion O
and O
garlic O
are O
very O
common O
spices O
. O
Those O
two O
were O
used O
in O
75 O
of O
my O
meals O

I O
am O
in O
remission O
... O
mostly O
, O
but O
I O
flare B-DIS
up I-DIS
during O
my O
period O
or O
when O
I O
m O
under O
a O
lot O
of O
stress B-DIS
. O
I O
also O
have O
idiopathic B-DIS
urticaria I-DIS
which O
resolved O
around O
the O
same O
time O
I O
went O
into O
remission O
. O
Since O
mast O
cells O
are O
involved O
in O
both O
IC B-DIS
and O
urticaria B-DIS
, O
I O
think O
in O
my O
case O
, O
there O
may O
be O
an O
autoimmune O
component O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
for O
sure O
and O
I O
haven O
t O
brought O
it O
up O
with O
my O
uro O

I O
m O
just O
riding O
this O

as O
long O
as O
it O

last O

Don O
t O
know O
if O
this O
post O
helps O
at O
all O
. O

Thanks O
for O
your O
reply O
I O
actually O
came O
to O
the O
same O
conclusion O
after O
trying O
a O
couple O
of O
brands O
. O
Jobst O
20-30 O
feels O
the O
most O
comfortable O
and O
the O
UltraSheer O
blends O
with O
my O
skin O
tone O
pretty O
well O
, O
for O
times O
when O
I O
m O
wearing O

. O
I O
got O
the O
thigh O

on O
Amazon O
for O
40 O
, O
too O
Yay O
. O

Are O
you O
taking O
Flomax B-DRUG

I O
ve O
had O
this O
in O
the O
past O
. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
after O
a O
case O
of O
optic B-DIS
neuritis I-DIS
. O
I O
had O
the O
tingling B-DIS
then O
, O
along O
with O
discomfort B-DIS
and I-DIS
loss I-DIS
of I-DIS
vision I-DIS
. O
After O
being O
treated O
I O
would O
sometimes O
get O
that O
tingling B-DIS
and O
eye B-DIS
fatigue I-DIS
for O
a O
few O
years O
afterwards O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
experienced O
it O
for O
a O
while O
. O
As O
with O
anything O
regarding O
MS B-DIS
it O
s O
hard O
to O
know O
. O
It O
might O
not O
be O
a O
bad O
idea O
to O
see O
an O
ophthalmologist O
along O
with O
your O
neuro O
if O
it O
doesn O
t O
go O
away O
or O
worsens O
. O

My O
cat O

I O
understand O
that O
to O
a O
point O
. O
I O
think O
perhaps O
the O
whole O
point O
of O
living O
is O
to O
surround O
yourself O
with O
good O
, O
like O
minded O
people O
. O
In O
that O
case O
you O
are O
absolutely O
correct O
. O
I O
have O
hobbies O
. O
I O
enjoy O
music O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
over O
the O
past O
3 O
years O
, O
any O
money O
I O
have O
earned O
and O
spent O
has O
been O
put O
in O
to O
what O
is O
now O
, O
a O
respectable O
studio O
. O
I O
spend O
10 O
hours O
a O
day O
producing O
. O
I O
have O
nothing O
else O
to O
do O
. O
But O
it O
s O
all O
meaningless O
, O
if O
I O
don O
t O
have O
other O
people O
who O
are O
able O
to O
appreciate O
it O
with O
me O
. O
I O
suppose O
you O
re O
right O
, O
we O
get O
to O
associate O
with O
those O
that O
we O
want O
to O
now O
that O
we O
are O
adults O
and O
I O
guess O
that O
is O
a O
fact O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
I O
guess O
my O
problem O
is O
, O
like O
I O
said O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
how O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
anymore O
. O
I O
ve O
chosen O
this O
path O
, O
largely O
due O
to O
certain O
circumstances O
and O
experiences O
. O
I O
m O
in O
a O
rut O
, O
where O
I O
don O
t O
even O
want O
to O
bother O
trying O
to O
talk O
to O
people O
anymore O
due O
to O
my O
past O
experiences O
with O
people O
. O
It O
is O
not O
an O
easy O
hole O
to O
get O
out O
of O
. O
Ive O
been O
trying O
for O
5 O
years O
. O
It O
s O
hard O
to O
keep O
trying O
sometimes O
. O
It O
took O
you O
ten O
years O
. O
Some O
people O
are O
stronger O
than O
others O
I O
know O
, O
but O
man O
I O
can O
t O
take O
another O
6 O
months O
. O
I O
know O
I O
can O
t O
ask O
for O
a O
miracle O
, O
all O
I O
can O
ask O
for O
is O
experience O
. O
And O
I O
really O
appreciate O
you O
sharing O
yours O
. O

Thank O
you O
, O
I O
ll O
ask O
about O
this O
at O
my O
2 O
month O
check O
up O

I O
don O
t O
feel O
nearly O
as O
nauseated B-DIS
now O
as O
I O
used O
to O
after O
eating O
, O
but O
I O
also O
have O
chronic B-DIS
regurgitation I-DIS
my O
food O
comes O
up O
spontaneously O
without O
any O
heaving O
all O
of O
the O
time O
. O
I O
think O
finding O
the O
right O
foods O
and O
avoiding O
trigger O
foods O
and O
trigger O
activities O
played O
a O
large O
role O
in O
reducing O
nausea B-DIS
. O
I O
really O
hope O
that O
you O
are O
able O
to O
experiment O
and O
find O
what O
works O
for O
you O
- O
that O
sounds O
truly O
exhausting O
. O

Thank O
you O
so O
so O
much O
, O
May O
God O
bless O

Suffer O
until O
you O
get O
over O
your O
pickiness O

I O
ve O
never O
personally O
tried O
Charlotte O
s O
Web O
, O
but O
the O
folks O
at O
r O
CBD O
should O
be O
able O
to O
recommend O
some O
trustworthy O
vendors O
of O
legal O
hemp-based B-DRUG
CBD I-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
. O

Hide O
the O
knives O
and O
scissors O
. O
Get O
her O
seen O
stat O
. O
Make O
sure O
she O
gets O
referred O
to O
a O
neurologist O
and O
or O
geriatric O
psychologist O
within O
the O
next O
2 O
months O
. O
The O
fact O
that O
she O
went O
for O
a O
knife O
makes O
her O
a O
possible O
danger O
to O
herself O
or O
others O
. O
In O
some O
circles O
that O
quantifies O
a O
minimum O
48 O
hour O
psych O
hold O
last O
time O
I O
checked O
. O
Before O
you O
get O
spooked O
, O
that O
is O
a O
GOOD O
THING O
She O
needs O
a O
thorough O
evaluation O
and O
I O
would O
also O
recommend O
a O
urinalysis B-DIS
if O
this O
is O
sudden O
onset O
. O
Bladder B-DIS
infections I-DIS
can O
do O
wacky O
things O
to O
the O
brain O
. O

My O
urologist O
gave O
me O
a O
list O
of O
foods O
, O
and O
coffee O
wasn O
t O
on O
the O
list O
. O
He O
was O
also O
skeptical O
, O
basically O
saying O
that O
I O
could O
try O
avoiding O
those O
foods O
but O
that O
he O
didn O
t O
expect O
it O
to O
make O
much O
, O
if O
any O
difference O
. O
it O
later O
turned O
out O
that O
it O
s O
likely O
I O
form O
stones B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
left I-DIS
kidney I-DIS
due O
to O
having O
an O
otherwise O
harmless B-DIS
cyst I-DIS
there O
that O
likely O
allows O
fluids O
to O
pool O
He O
said O
that O
drinking O
more O
fluids O
regularly O
of O
any O
kind O
was O
about O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
would O
definitely O
help O
. O

Paper O

angle O
the O

so O
the O

I O
ve O
been O
taking O
MTX B-DRUG
for O
about O
2.5 O
years O
. O
I O
started O
at O
10mg O
week O
, O
and O
it O
was O
really O
rough O
. O
I O
took O
them O
Friday O
night O
so O
I O
could O
sleep O
in O
as O
late O
as O
I O
needed O
on O
Saturday O
, O
and O
I O
usually O
felt O
pretty O
wiped O
out O
until O
at O
least O
later O
afternoon O
on O
that O
day O
. O
I O
also O
had O
some O
pretty O
rough O
brain B-DIS
fog I-DIS
-- O
slow B-DIS
processing I-DIS
, O
stubborn B-DIS
memory I-DIS
, O
all O
that O
awful O
stuff O
. O
But O
I O
think O
it O
dissipated O
over O
the O
course O
of O
about O
a O
year O
and O
half O
. O
I O
m O
up O
15mg O
week O
but O
I O
don O
t O
need O
to O
sleep O
in O
after O
and O
I O
can O
work O
out O
the O
next O
day O
. O
I O
also O
think O
the O
brain B-DIS
fog I-DIS
is O
pretty O
much O
over O
for O
now O
. O
But O
it O
took O
some O
time O
. O
It O
won O
t O
last O
forever O
, O
but O
please O
have O
patience O
. O
I O
m O
really O
active O
, O
physically O
and O
intellectually O
, O
so O
it O
took O
a O
heavy O
toll O
on O
my O
emotions O
and O
how O
I O
saw O
see O
myself O
. O
Therapy O
was O
really O
helpful O
for O
that O
. O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
what O
your O
options O
are O
, O
but O
if O
your O
wife O
is O
open O
to O
it O
and O
it O
s O
accessible O
, O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
a O
shot O
. O
I O
definitely O
suffer O
fatigue B-DIS
much O
easier O
than O
I O
did O
when O
I O
was O
younger O
, O
and O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
if O
it O
s O
the O
RA B-DIS
itself O
, O
or O
the O
meds O
, O
or O
both O
. O
That O
hasn O
t O
gone O
away O
-- O
I O

you O
may O
have O
a O
complicated O

what O
you O
have O
going O

you O
is O
your O

you O
still O

not O
found O
the O

you O
need O
. O
It O
sounds O
like O
the O
Dr O

tried O

don O

know O
how O

handle O
your O

management O
I O
know O
, O
really O
really O
difficult O
I O
feel O

a O
holistic O
approach O
is O
the O
best O
way O

you O
are O
also O
talking O

someone O
who O
only O
goes O

a O

the O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
specific O
information O
on O
tests O
. O
I O
have O
another O
appointment O
with O
my O
ENT O
coming O
up O
and O
I O
will O
bring O
this O
up O
. O

I O
did O
not O
really O
enjoy O
my O
job O
, O
I O
can O
only O
imagine O
how O
much O
harder O
this O
would O
have O
been O
on O
me O
if O
I O
did O
something O
I O
enjoyed O
. O
Honestly O
I O
felt O
like O
my O
intelligence O
was O
being O
wasted O
there O
, O
I O
m O
no O
Einstein O
but O
damn O
my O
job O
was O
boring O
I O
live O
in O
the O
Midwest O
U.S. O
and O
I O
suppose O
school O
could O
be O
a O
great O
way O
to O
not O
give O
up O
on O
finding O
a O
way O
to O
earn O
a O
living O
... O
however O
I O
think O
the O
only O
way O
I O
could O
do O
that O
is O
by O
applying O
for O
government O
grants O
once O
I O
am O
labeled O
disabled O
by O
the O
government O
. O
My O
credit O
is O
about O
to O
take O
a O
massive O
hit O
too O
Probably O
gon O
na O
file O
bankruptcy O
soon O
As O
well O
as O
me O
having O
to O
apply O
for O
all O
sorts O
of O
financial O
assistance O
and O
I O
m O
gon O
na O
have O
to O
move O
somewhere O
that O
I O
can O
actually O
afford O
and O
that O
is O
accommodating O
to O
my O
disabilities O
. O
I O
think O
I O
m O
like O
most O
of O
us O
I O
really O
want O
to O
know O
what O
I O
can O
do O
to O
fix O
the O
situation O
now O
, O
but O
there O
s O
only O
so O
much O
you O
can O
do O
at O
certain O
points O
. O
So O
I O
m O
always O
clawing O
at O
the O
next O
door O
Thanks O
for O
the O
advice O
I O
hope O
your O
eye O
sight O
gets O
and O
stays O
better O
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O

Well O
for O
one O
, O
I O
wouldn O
t O
be O
cooped O
up O
in O
the O
privacy O
of O
my O
apartment O
. O
I O
would O
pretty O
much O
be O
around O
people O
the O
entire O
time O
. O

Thank O
you O
I O
might O
have O
to O
give O
up O
on O
belly O
sleep O

I O
appreciate O
the O
effort O
you O
put O
into O
making O
this O
subreddit O

great O
resource O

Similar O
to O

I O
do O
the O
injectable O
version O
. O
It O
s O
only O
been O
3-4 O
months O
for O
me O
. O
It O
has O
improved O
my O
RA B-DIS
but O
not O
enough O
so O
I O
ll O
probably O
get O
a O
biologic O
soon O
. O
I O
take O
it O
every O
Friday O
night O
and O
haven O
t O
experienced O
any O
side O
effects O
aside O
from O
a O
minor B-DIS
bruise I-DIS
sometimes O
where O
the O
injection O
was O
, O
but O
this O

Update O
in O
post O

gt O
; O
Ocrevus B-DRUG
or O
Rituxan B-DRUG
does O
not O
reduce O
disability O
, O
so O
your O
EDSS O
dropping O
from O
3 O
to O
1.5 O
was O
due O
to O
your O
body O
repairing O
the O
damage O
done O
after O
your O
relapse O
. O
That O
s O
a O
really O
good O
point O

I O
feel O

variations O
of O
the O
same O
sentiment O
I O
took O

X O
and O
my O
EDSS O
dropped O
get O
repeated O
a O
lot O
on O
MS B-DIS

It O
s O
not O
even O
drug-specific O
. O
People O
conflate O
feeling O
better O
after O
a O
relapse O
with O
a O
drug O
*causing* O
the O
improvement O
. O
I O
think O
it O
s O
very O
important O
to O
keep O
those O
things O
separate O
. O
People O
wouldn O
t O
place O
unrealistic O
hopes O
on O
drugs O
, O
for O
one O
. O
And O
another O
benefit O
would O
be O
not O
having O
to O
listen O
to O
well-meaning O
people O
talk O
about O
some O
miracle O
drug O
that O
reversed O
people O
s O
MS. B-DIS
Like O
, O
no O
. O
None O
of O
the O
current O
drugs O
actually O
reverse O
MS B-DIS
damage O
. O
Same O
goes O

who O
push O
their O

cure O

because O
you O

you O

I O
declined O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
for O
months O

didn O
t O
work O

I O
m O

yes O
, O
there O
are O
other O
drugs O
to O
try O
before O

I O
did O
try O
all O

of O
supplements O

such O
to O
no O
avail O

ve O

give O
it O
to O

focus O
on O
getting O
on O

have O
improved O
my O
quality O

much O
in O

I O

going O

Fevers B-DIS
were O
early O
on O
, O
I O
got O
a O
shot O
for O
it O
at O
the O
original O
doctor O
, O
don O
t O
believe O
ive O
had O
any O
since O
, O
just O
pain B-DIS
. O
So O
not O
sure O
, O
its O
been O
3 O
weeks O
is O
it O
possible O
this O
will O
still O
pass O
on O
its O
own O

That O
s O
what O
I O
did O
and O
it O
helped O
me O
immensely O
Still O
have O
bad O
days O
and O
flare B-DIS
ups I-DIS
, O
but O
not O
as O
bad O
or O
as O
often O
. O

A O
CRP O
of O
13 O
sounds O
pretty O
decent- O
I O
ve O
had O
years O
of O
CRP O
around O
50 O
without O
many O
symptoms O
apart O
from O
being O
tired B-DIS
. O
A O
common O
cold O
can O
result O
in O
an O
increased O
CRP O
too O
, O
and O
who O
knows O
what O
kind O
of O
processes O
your O
body O
s O
- O
is O
now O
going O
through O
that O
may O
also O
contribute O
. O
If O
I O
were O
you O
I O
would O
also O
worry O
, O
but O
just O
from O
those O
numbers O
it O
sounds O
alright O
Do O
check O
regularly O
though O
, O
to O
see O
if O
it O
remains O
at O
this O
level O
. O
All O
the O
best O

Definitely O
bring O
it O
for O
testing O
. O
I O
had O
a O
similar O
situation O
that O
was O
an O
overgrowth B-DIS
of I-DIS
yeast I-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
urinary I-DIS
tract I-DIS
. O
It O
might O
be O
nothing O
serious O
but O
it O
might O
be O
a O
type O
of O
infection B-DIS
that O
you O
need O
additional O
medication O
for O
. O

Thank O
you O
. O

It O
s O
all O
trial O
and O
error O
, O
essentially O
. O
I O
ve O
found O
high O
CBD B-DRUG
strains O
with O
lower O
THC B-DRUG
are O
more O
effective O
for O
nerve B-DIS
pain I-DIS
and O
tremors B-DIS
, O
with O
sativa B-DRUG
during O
the O
day O
and O
indica B-DRUG
at O
night O
. O
High O
THC B-DRUG
strains O
make O
me O
feel O
worse O
sometimes O
, O
and O
actually O
increased O
the O
tingling B-DIS
buzzing B-DIS
. O
I O
prefer O
vaping O
the O
oils O
, O
but O
the O
flower O
is O
cheaper O
so O
I O
usually O
use O
the O
flower O
at O
home O
and O
the O
vape O
pen O
in O
public O

, O
etc O
. O
They O
also O
make O

cooked O
in O
coconut O
or O
vegetable O
oil O
, O
but O
those O
are O
also O
pricey O
. O
I O
d O
recommend O
buying O
a O
little O
of O
each O
and O
trying O
them O
out O
on O
different O
days O
to O
see O
what O
works O
for O
you O
. O
Good O
luck O

As O
someone O
who O
has O
a O
blanket O
buying O
habit O
... O
it O
honestly O
depends O
on O
the O
night O
. O
I O
have O
thinner O
sherpa O
blankets O
that O
do O
the O
trick O
sometimes O
, O
other O
times O
it O
s O
just O
a O
sheet O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
want O
no O
blanket O
on O
me O
and O
I O
m O
overheating O
no O
matter O
what O
. O
Layers O
are O
the O
best O
. O
Also O
a O
fan O
with O
a O
remote O
that O
you O
could O
click O
on O
without O
getting O
out O
of O
bed O
. O

I O
m O
right O
there O
with O
you O
. O
I O
need O
an O
explain O
it O
like O
I O
m O
5 O
version O
. O

I O
ve O
recently O
gone O
vegan O
so O
have O
vastly O
increased O
the O
fibre O
I O
m O
eating O
. O
Weirdly O
eating O
vegan O
has O
improved O
my O
GP B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
, O
but O
slowed B-DIS
down I-DIS
my I-DIS
bowels I-DIS
given B-DIS
me I-DIS
constipation I-DIS
. O
So O
I O
don O
t O
think O
it O
s O
a O
lack O
of O
fibre O
causing O
the O
issue O
for O
me O
. O
I O
put O
it O
down O
to O
chronic B-DIS
mild I-DIS
dehydration I-DIS
. O
Taking O
Movicol B-DRUG
Macrogol B-DRUG
regularly O
generally O
sorts O
me O
out O
. O

gt O
; O
you O
used O
to O
tell O
a O
patient O
how O
to O
live O
her O
life O
Those O
are O
some O
strong O
words O
for O
something O
said O
tongue O
in O
cheek O
, O
with O
a O
subsequent O
explanation O
behind O
the O
reasoning O
for O
it O
, O
which O
was O
concern O
for O
the O
poster O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
an O
attempt O
at O
inflaming O
them O
. O
gt O
; O
I O
wish O
you O
would O
think O
more O
carefully O
before O
you O
do O
this O
, O
because O
it O
can O
cause O
people O
a O
lot O
of O
pain O
. O
The O
person O
in O
question O
didn O
t O
respond O
in O
a O
way O
in O
which O
upset O
was O
indicated O
. O
I O
get O
the O
impression O
that O
you O
overstep O
the O
mark O
at O
times O
- O
it O
is O
important O
to O
moderate O
discussion O
and O
correct O
people O
when O
they O
are O
wrong O
and O
I O
enjoy O
these O
discussions O
, O
as O
all O
learning O
experiences O
move O
us O
forward O
, O
however O
missing O
the O
point O
entirely O
and O
chastising O
disproportionately O
is O
unproductive O
. O

AFAIK O
there O
are O
no O
blood O
tests O
. O
Unless O
you O
start O
some O
biologics O
which O
require O
a O
TB B-DIS
check O
. O
Other O
medications O
required O
a O
liver O
biopsy O
. O

I O
am O
having O
the O
same O
problem O
, O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
passed O
it O
but O
there O
is O
still O
blood B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
urine I-DIS
and O
it O
burns B-DIS
when I-DIS
i I-DIS
pee I-DIS
, O
I O
ve O
already O
had O
the O
side B-DIS
pain I-DIS
but O
idk O
what O
s O
happening O
now O
. O

I O
m O
glad O
you O
figured O
out O
the O
right O
mix O
of O
meds O
I O
thought O
I O
did O
until O
this O
wave O
of O
depression B-DIS
kicked O
me O
on O
my O
ass O
hah O
, O
will O
suggest O
cymbalta B-DRUG
to O
my O
rheumi O
next O
visit O
Thank O
u O

gt O
; O
But O
looking O
back O
I O
realized O
I O
had O
since O
puberty O
1993-ish O
, O
just O
never O
showed O
any O
symptoms O
except O
itching B-DIS
. O
what O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
this O
How O
did O
you O
realize O
that O
you O
ve O
had O
psoriasis B-DIS
since O
puberty O
Thank O
you O

I O
sometimes O
drink O
heavily O
at O
the O
weekends O
. O
I O
need O
to O
pee O
pretty O
much O
constantly O
when O
drinking O
and O
it O
can O
get O
painful O
. O
I O
know O
it O
s O
a O
bit O
hard O
to O
explain O
but O
the O
effect O
of O
that O
alcohol O
helps O
too O
in O
that O
it O
makes O
the O
symptoms O
more O
bearable O
it O
makes O
me O
me O
care O
less O
or O
forget O
about O
having O
the O
symptoms O
I O
guess O
I O
try O
to O
drink O
the O
following O
drinks O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
, O
given O
recommendations O
on O
here O
and O
also O
my O
own O
experience O
- O
vodka O
and O
soda O
water O
or O
vodka O
and O
ice O
Others O
on O
here O
recommend O
drinking O
grey O
goose O
- O
Corona O
- O
White O
russian O
vodka O
, O
kahlua O
and O
milk O
I O
try O
and O
avoid O
stuff O
like O
fruity O
cocktails O
, O
coke O
sprite O
, O
and O
beer O
although O
I O
don O
t O
always O
stick O
to O
it O
. O
I O
should O
point O
out O
that O
my O
urologist O
has O
not O
diagnosed O
me O
with O
IC B-DIS
although O
I O
am O
pretty O
certain O
that O
I O
have O
it O
given O
my O
symptoms O
which O
have O
been O
ongoing O
for O
around O
1 O
year O
now O
. O
I O
will O
have O
a O
follow O
up O
soon O

Yeah O
, O
it O
can O
go O
into O
remission O
for O
years O
and O
then O
fire O
up O
again O
. O
It O
really O
can O
be O
different O
for O
everyone O
so O
its O
hard O
to O
give O
advice O
on O
what O
to O
do O
other O
than O
go O
see O
a O
specialist O
neurotologist O
. O
Ideally O
, O
as O
the O
ear O
burns O
out O
, O
the O
signal O
to O
your O
brain O
gets O
weaker O
and O
your O
vertigo O
gets O
less O
severe O
. O
The O
burn O
out O
period O
can O
be O
short O
for O
some O
and O
might O
never O
happen O
for O
others O
. O
And O
then O
you O
never O
know O
if O
youre O
in O
a O
remission O
either O
. O
Its O
really O
frustrating O
. O
I O
dealt O
with O
the O
1-5 O
hour O
vertigo O
attacks O
for O
4 O
years O
before O
it O
started O
happening O
without O
warning O
similar O
to O
drops O
, O
basically O
a O
siezure O
and O
went O
to O
a O
specialist O
to O
kill O
off O
the O
function O
in O
that O
ear O
. O
If O
your O
dad O
has O
it O
in O
one O
ear O
, O
there O
are O
options O
for O
sure O
. O
Both O
ears O
is O
more O
difficult O
as O
youre O
balance O
can O
get O
pretty O
bad O
. O

For O
him O
, O
he O
denies O
everything O
, O
so O
it O
s O
difficult O
for O
him O
to O
see O
that O
he O
even O
needs O
to O
tell O
his O
doctor O
these O
things O
. O
It O
took O
his O
wife O
going O
behind O
his O
back O
calling O
his O
doctor O
, O
in O
tears O
, O
for O
my O
dad O
to O
accept O
that O
maybe O
he O
had O
some O
problems O
, O
and O
maybe O
the O
medicine O
was O
part O
of O
it O
. O
His O
doctor O
had O
to O
explicitly O
tell O
him O
he O
needed O
to O
do O
something O
different O
before O
he O
said O
yeah O
, O
maybe O
I O
shouldn O
t O
be O
drinking B-DIS
to I-DIS
passing I-DIS
out I-DIS
every O
night O
and O
I O
don O
t O
need O
1000 O
worth O
of O
banjos O
I O
don O
t O
know O
how O
to O
play O
. O
He O
s O
an O
abusive B-DIS
drunk I-DIS
, O
and O
his O
wife O
has O
gotten O
to O
the O
point O
where O
she O
is O
taking O
a O
job O
in O
another O
state O
for O
the O
summer O
to O
get O
away O
from O
him O
. O
And O
even O
then O
, O
it O
wasn O
t O
until O
his O
doctor O
told O
him O
it O
was O
bad O
that O
he O
believed O
it O
was O
. O
It O
s O
a O
tough O
road O
. O

have O
you O
gotten O
any O
side O
effects O
yet O

My O
heart O
goes O
out O
to O
you O
. O
There O
is O
a O
time O
when O
you O
can O
enjoy O
every O
day O
, O
and O
when O
it O
is O
close O
to O
the O
end O
you O
wish O
it O
would O
come O
. O
Are O
you O
in O
a O
location O
that O
allows O
Medically O
Assisted O
Dying O
I O
am O
aware O
it O
is O
allowed O
in O
Switzerland O
and O
in O
Washington O
and O
Oregon O
States O
in O
USA O
. O
I O
hope O
they O
have O
a O
social O
worker O
who O
can O
talk O
with O
your O
Dad O
. O
It O
is O
good O
your O
Mom O
is O
lucid O
, O
so O
her O
wishes O
are O
clear O
. O
I O
just O
hope O
I O
am O
as O
lucid O
as O
your O
Mom O
, O
and O
my O
wicked O
sense O
of O
humor O
never O

My O
heart O
goes O
out O
to O
you O
, O
your O
Mom O
, O
and O
your O
Family O

I O
found O
going O
to O
the O
gym O
to O
be O
the O
best O
thing O
for O
my O
psoriasis B-DIS
as O
well O
. O
Cheers O
Keep O
it O
up O

Thanks O
for O
sharing O
My O
left O
hand O
particularly O
struggles O
a O
lot O
and O
I O
have O
been O
sporadically O
stretching O
it O
by O
doing O
similar O
movements O
. O
It O
s O
nice O
to O
see O
a O
structured O
routine O
that O
I O
can O
use O

I O
also O
use O
Saltstick B-DRUG
. O
I O
have O
no O
adverse O
reactions O
to O
it O
. O

I O
went O
the O
better O
part O
of O
a O
year O
before O
I O
passed B-DIS
a I-DIS
8mm I-DIS
stone I-DIS
. O
My O
doctor O
missed O
it O
in O
all O
her O
exams O
since O
I O
ve O
never O
had O
one O
and O
nobody O
in O
my O
family O
has O
either O
. O
Anyway O
, O
the O
final O
rounds O
of O
pain B-DIS
before O
it O
popped O
out O
would O
last O
from O
1 O
to O
3 O
days O
. O
It O
was O
terrible O
... O
Hang O
in O
there O
. O
If O
your O
meds O
aren O
t O
doing O
it O
, O
try O
different O
body O
positions O
, O
lots O
of O
water O
with O
lemon O
. O
This O
too O
will O
pass O
literally O
. O

A O
cure O
requires O
knowledge O
of O
the O
cause O
, O
heuristics O
without O
a O
hypothesis O
are O
useless O
. O
Snake B-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
and O
Parkinson O
s O
are O
found O
together O
far O
too O
often O
. O

Good O
call O
. O
I O
had O
my O
deviated B-DIS
septum I-DIS
fixed O
and O
polyps B-DIS
removed O
. O
I O
just O
wrote O
a O
post O
about O
it O
that O
you O
might O
want O
to O
glance O
at O
I O
use O
a O
full O
face O
mask O
as O
well O
and O
that O
s O
what O
I O
was O
going O
to O
suggest O
if O
you O
have O
nasal B-DIS
sinus B-DIS
issues I-DIS
in O
any O
way O
. O
I O
often O
end O
up O
with O
nose B-DIS
congestion I-DIS
my O
ENT O
is O
aware O
of O
this O
and O
so O
nasal O
pillows O
and O
other O
nose O
only O
solutions O
won O
t O
work O
for O
me O
either O
. O

Heat O
may O
help O
the O
muscles O
but O
it O
will O
damage O
your O
joints O
. O
I O
d O
avoid O
showering O
in O
the O
morning O
. O

Sure O
. O
Why O
not O

I O
ve O
been O
on O
methotrexate B-DRUG
twice O
and O
never O
had O
any O
bad O
reaction O
at O
all O
. O
Good O
luck O
. O

Can O
you O
tell O
me O
more O
about O
how O
you O
feel O
How O
often O
do O
you O
feel B-DIS
warm I-DIS
Like O
I O
feel B-DIS
uncomfortable I-DIS
lately O
when O
others O
feel O
comfortable O
. O
It O
seems O
related O
to O
the O
way O
the O
rooms O
feel O
in O
the O
winter O
with O
the O
heat O
on O
. O
Thanks O

Hmm O
that O
s O
interesting O
. O
I O
will O
see O
if O
I O
can O
find O
a O
jaw O
surgeon O
. O
The O
reason O
my O
dentist O
suggested O
Invisalign B-DRUG
is O
because O
my O
bite O
is O
off O
which O
is O
causing O
my O
teeth O
to O
grind O
over O
time O
. O
Thank O
you O

Still O
didn O
t O
trust O
you O
and O
thought O
it O
d O
be O
a O
rick O
roll O
lol O

heathers B-DRUG
fiber I-DRUG

I O
ve O
tried O
gluten O
free O
and O
Paleo O
and O
felt O
well O
on O
both O
but O
it O
s O
such O
a O
commitment O
and O
it O
s O
increasingly O
hard O
when O
the O
people O
you O
live O
with O
don O
t O
follow O
the O
same O
diet O
. O
I O
don O
t O
have O
strong O
enough O
will O
power O
. O

I O
use O
Zofran B-DRUG
for O
nausea B-DIS
and O
vomiting B-DIS
, O
try O
asking O
for O
that O
if O
your O
MMJ B-DRUG
pills I-DRUG
don O
t O
work O
or O
aren O
t O
covered O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
reply O
, O
also O
a O
good O
question O
. O
I O
cant O
remember O
, O
I O
do O
have O
a O
5 O
year O
old O
son O
who O
gets O
colds B-DIS
all O
the O
time O
from O
school O
. O
I O
could O
have O
gotten O
sick O
before O
surgery O
but O
don O
t O
remember O
. O
I O
m O
just O
lost O
for O
words O
, O
I O
cant O
believe O
I O
got O
this O
. O
With O
my O
POTS B-DIS
I O
do O
not O
pass O
out O
, O
but O
my O
blood B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
when I-DIS
standing I-DIS
is I-DIS
around I-DIS
100 I-DIS
60 B-DIS
. O
But O
what O
scares O
me O
even O
more O
is O
how O
my O
body O
reacts O
to O
adrenaline O
, O
my B-DIS
heart I-DIS
feels I-DIS
like I-DIS
it I-DIS
skips I-DIS
beats I-DIS
then O
I O
get O
real O
nauseous B-DIS
, O
and O
feel B-DIS
like I-DIS
passing I-DIS
out I-DIS
. O
I O
went O
to O
see O
a O
endocrinologist O
to O
see O
my O
adrenal O
glands O
, O
still O
waiting O
for O
results O
. O
Do O
you O
have O
any O
heart B-DIS
related I-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O
Whats O
so O
hard O
about O
all O
this O
is O
the O
wild B-DIS
swings I-DIS
, O
one O
minute O
im O
ok O
the O
next O
minute O

feel B-DIS
like I-DIS
im I-DIS
dyeing I-DIS
heart B-DIS
issues I-DIS
, O
adrenal B-DIS
issues I-DIS
, O
brain B-DIS
fog I-DIS
, O
etc.. O

Non O
issue O

Thanks O
for O
sharing O
this O
. O
It O
gives O
me O
hope O
I O
ll O
recover O
, O
but O
damn O
if O
6 O
months O
, O
years O
of O
this O
doesn O
t O
make O
me O
terrified O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
doing O
worse O
this O
past O
week O
, O
and O
while O
that O
s O
nothing O
particularly O
new O
I O
have O
good O
and O
bad O
weeks O
, O
says O
, O
I O
m O
very O
scared O
. O
I O
definitely O
have O
orthostatic B-DIS
intolerance I-DIS
, O
because O
standing O
I O
become O
dizzy B-DIS
and O
run B-DIS
out I-DIS
of I-DIS
energy I-DIS
real I-DIS
fast I-DIS
. O
But O
my O
HR O
doesn O
t O
go O
higher O
than O
140 O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
tried O
beta B-DRUG
blockers I-DRUG
yet O
, O
but O
I O
have O
them O
. O
I O
m O
just O
scared O
they O
ll O
make O
me O
more O
exhausted B-DIS
which O
, O
at O
this O
point O
, O
means O
completely O
bedridden O
. O
Right O
now O
, O
I O
spend O
the O
whole O
day O
in O
bed O
but O
I O
get O
up O
and O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
, O
the O
kitchen O
. O
It O
s O
definitely O
better O
if O
I O
stay O
in O
bed O
, O
but O
I O
can O
t O
just O
stay O
in O
bed O
. O
I O
do O
try O
to O
do O
the O
bare O
minimum O
, O
but O
I O
have O
doctors O
appointments O
, O
animals O
to O
care O
for O
and O
while O
my O
mother O
has O
taken O
over O
almost O
all O
the O
housework O
, O
I O
still O
shower O
and O
maintain O
my O
own O
hygiene O
. O
I O
also O
feel O
pressured O
to O
see O
my O
boyfriend O
once O
a O
week O
, O
even O
when O
I O
feel O
positively O
atrocious O
. O
I O
love O
him O
, O
but O
you O
know O
how O
socialization O
takes O
its O
toll O
. O
Do O
you O
also O
have O
terrible B-DIS
pain I-DIS
in I-DIS
your I-DIS
joints I-DIS
and I-DIS
muscles I-DIS
Chronic B-DIS
nausea I-DIS
I O
vomit B-DIS
all O
the O
time O
and O
I O
ve O
tried O
all O
the O
nausea O
meds O
out O
there O
. O
I O
do O
have O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
fibromyalgia B-DIS
and O
I O
believe O
it O
got O
a O
lot O
, O
lot O
worse O
because O
of O
whatever O
triggered O
this O
. O

Haven O
t O
heard O
of O
it O
, O
but O
I O
hope O
you O
get O
the O
expected O
results O
I O
was O
just O
looking O
at O
the O
printout O
the O
nurse O
gave O
me O
and O
it O
says O
gt O
; O
6.4 O
is O
diabetic B-DIS
, O
but O
I O
could O
swear O
the O
diabetes B-DIS
information O
session O
said O
up O
to O
6.9 O
was O
pre-diabetic B-DIS
. O
Anyway O
, O
it O
wouldn O
t O
be O
the O
first O
time O
that O
I O
see O
two O
or O
more O
different O
stories O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
diabetes B-DIS
information O
. O
That O
was O
one O
of O
the O
most O
frustrating O
things O
since O
I O
got O
my O
diagnosis O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
is O
an O
anticholinergic B-DRUG
, O
which O
inhibites O
nerve O
impulses O
good O
for O
lots O
of O
things O
, O
but O
not O
gastroparesis B-DIS
. O
Though O
I O
think O
Prozac B-DRUG
has O
less O
of O
this O
effect O
than O
other O
SSRIs B-DRUG
. O
If O
the O
prozac B-DRUG
is O
effective O
for O
your O
PMDD B-DIS
you O
might O
have O
to O
consider O
just O
putting O
up O
with O
increased B-DIS
gastro I-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O
Make O
sure O
to O
drink O
a O
lot O
of O
fluids O
so O
you O
don O
t O
get O
dehydrated B-DIS
and O
eating O
things O
with O
mint O
and O
ginger O
. O
You O
could O
try O
having O
meal O
replacement O
shakes O
and O
smoothies O
, O
hummus O
, O
etc O
for O
a O
while O
to O
give O
your O
stomach O
a O
rest O
. O

I O
had O
the O
same O
problems O
a O
few O
years O
ago O
. O
Turns O
out O
eating O
too O
much O
soy O
was O
really O
screwing O
with O
my O
horomones O
. O
I O
cut O
off O
soy O
, O
started O
exercising O
, O
and O
consumed O
more O
vitamin B-DRUG
d I-DRUG
zinc B-DRUG
. O
This O
is O
assuming O
you O
re O
male O
but O
it O
s O
helped O
me O
a O
ton O
. O

My O
current O
belief O
is O
that O
an O
accumulation O
of O
simultaneous O
stress B-DIS
from O
numerous O
sources O
environmental O
, O
dietary O
, O
viral O
, O
etc O
. O
will O
increase O
the O
odds O
of O
the O
immune O
system O
going O
feral B-DIS
or O
hyperactive B-DIS
, O
leading O
to O
a O
multiplicity O
of O
potential O
conditions O
such O
as O
burn-out B-DIS
, O
CFS B-DIS
or O
MS B-DIS
for O
instance O
. O

Thanks O
guys O
, O
you O
re O
very O
nice O
and O
supportive O
and O
make O
up O
good O
points O
im O
really O
hoping O
it O
s O
not O
my O
intestines O
and O
im O
still O
waiting O
on O
my O
feeding O
nurse O
to O
come O
. O

This O
won O
t O
last O
forever O
. O
Don O
t O
panic O
. O
As O
others O
have O
said O
, O
do O
see O
a O
doctor O
so O
you O
can O
have O
tests O
done O
to O
rule O
out O
other O
causes O
, O
but O
if O
it O
is O
your O
CFS B-DIS
, O
do O
what O
your O
body O
is O
telling O
you O
to O
do O
and O
rest O
. O
Don O
t O
worry O
about O
the O
things O
you O
re O
not O
doing O
, O
or O
how O
long O
it O
might O
take O
to O
get O
back O
to O
them O
. O
I O
know O
that O
is O
easy O
to O
say O
and O
impossible O
to O
do O
, O
but O
as O
you O
realize O
, O
this O
isn O
t O
a O
game O
, O
and O
you O
need O
to O
focus O
on O
the O
task O
at O
hand O
, O
which O
is O
managing O
symptoms O
and O
healing O
, O
not O
whatever O
your O
story O
had O
been O
up O
to O
this O
point O
. O
Allow O
it O
to O
be O
sad O
for O
as O
long O
as O
it O
takes O
, O
but O
do O
give O
in O
to O
it O
, O
and O
stop O
fighting O
, O
because O
that O
only O
makes O
it O
worse O
. O
Pay O
attention O
to O
your O
body O
. O
Are O
you O
still O
breathing B-DIS
How O
does O
it O
feel O
Can O
you O
accept O
this O
moment O
for O
what O
it O
is O
That O
is O
your O
job O
now O
, O
nothing O
else O
. O
It O
is O
more O
than O
challenging O
enough O
. O
Good O
luck O
my O
friend O
. O
I O
know O
you O
can O
get O
through O
this O
. O

His O
driving O
got O
worse O
as O
his O
brain B-DIS
tumor I-DIS
grew O
, O
and O
even O
after O
the O
operation O
it O
stayed O
at O
that O
poor B-DIS
driving I-DIS
level I-DIS
. O
Running O
red O
lights O
, O
accidents O
, O
falling O
asleep O
at O
the O
wheel O
, O
not O
obeying O
the O
speed O
limits O
or O
traffic O
laws O
. O
On O
multiple O
occasions O
, O
both O
with O
me O
and O
me O
following O
behind O
him O
that O
I O
had O
witnessed O
. O
And O
his O
truck O
is O
a O
stick O
shift O
. O
Eventually O
I O
started O
blocking O
his O
truck O
in O
the O
driveway O
with O
my O
car O
so O
he O
couldn O
t O
go O
anywhere O
, O
and O
if O
he O
did O
I O
would O
make O
him O
ride O
passenger O
while O
I O
drove O
. O
I O
also O
gave O
the O
keys O
a O
new O
home O
, O
as O
in O
I O
pit O
command O
hooks O
up O
for O
them O
to O
be O
so O
that O
way O
they O
weren O
t O
just O
laying O
around O
me O
we O
know O
who O
was O
where O
. O
I O
mentioned O
it O
to O
both O
the O
neurologist O
and O
Neurosurgeon O
that O
took O
out O
his O
tumor B-DIS
, O
who O
both O
came O
to O
an O
agreement O
to O
have O
him O
take O
a O
drivers O
test O
with O
the O
state O
. O
Turns O
out O
he O
had O
five O
near O
misses O
over O
the O
course O
of O
that O
hour O
exam O
, O
of O
which O
the O
tester O
had O
to O
use O
his O
emergency O
brake O
. O
The O
tester O
filled O
the O
formal O
paperwork O
with O
the O
doctors O
office O
and O
the O
state O
, O
the O
state O
sent O
a O
letter O
saying O
he O
was O
suspended O
and O
that O
he O
had O
ten O
days O
to O
turn O
his O
license O
in O
, O
he O
was O
taken O
off O
the O
car O
insurance O
, O
the O
truck O
is O
now O
driven O
by O
my O
mom O
, O
and O
that O
was O
the O
end O
of O
that O
. O
Well O
, O
recently O
I O
ve O
found O
out O
the O
the O
neurologist O
never O
revived O
a O
copy O
of O
that O
report O
, O
and O
filled O
for O
him O
to O
test O
again O
even O
though O
I O
have O
told O
him O
on O
multiple O
occasions O
what O
the O
outcome O
of O
that O
test O
was O
. O
I O
was O

then O
contacted O
by O
that O
same O
test O
center O
and O
it O
led O
to O
the O
discussion O
of O
how O
he O
had O
already O
been O
tested O
by O
them O
and O
the O
revoke O
of O
his O
license O
. O
Now O
, O
they O
the O
test O
center O
, O
refuse O
to O
test O
him O
again O
and O
that O
drivers O
license O
is O
medically O
suspended O
indefinitely O
. O
It O
s O
not O
coming O
back O
. O
He O
also O
has O
uncontrolled B-DIS
diabetes I-DIS
and O
neuropathy B-DIS
in I-DIS
his I-DIS
legs I-DIS
, O
that O
report O
also O
told O
us O
how O
bad O
his O
short O
term O
memory O
is O
-- O
it O
s O
pretty O
much O
non O
existent O
. O

I O
can O
relate O
but O
in O
a O
different O
way O
. O
My O
husband O
has O
a O
huge O
sexual O
past O
and O
mine O
is O
pretty O
limited O
. O
Honestly O
, O
his O
past O
turns O
me O
on O
to O
hear O
about O
. O
It O
also O
makes O
me O
jealous O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
ve O
missed O
out O
on O
a O
lot O
because O
he O
s O
not O
that O
way O
with O
me O
. O
I O
know O
it O
s O
just O
because O
he O
s O
maturing O
as O
he O
s O
getting O
older O
, O
but O
I O
want O
those O
experiences O
. O
We O
ve O
had O
3somes O
but O
not O
in O
about O
10 O
years O
. O
I O
want O
the O
outdoor O
sex O
, O
the O
spur O
of O
the O
moment O
I O
need O
you O
sex O
, O
the O
I O
hate O
you O
but O
I O
need O
to O
f*ck O
you O
sex O
. O
I O
truly O
haven O
t O
found O
a O
healthy O
way O
of O
coping O
with O
the O
fact O
I O
ll O
probably O
never O
have O
any O
of O
that O
with O
him O
. O

Have O
you O
ever O
tried O
online O
dating O
OKCupid O
, O
Bumble O
, O
Tinder O
I O
think O
you O
d O
find O
attention O
there O
. O

I O
find O
sitting O
beside O
someone O
and O
doing O
tasks O
together O
, O
even O
something O
as O
simple O
as O
folding O
laundry O
can O
be O
good O
. O
or O
dusting O
together O
. O
Something O
that O
is O
easily O
copied O
. O
If O
you O
do O
it O
together O
it O
avoids O
the O
feeling O
of O
Busywork O
. O
Think O
back O
to O
things O
your O
grandma O
enjoyed O
doing O
, O
if O
she O
liked O
gardening O
can O
you O
both O
go O
for O
a O
wander O
in O
the O
garden O
and O
maybe O
do O
some O
weeding O
Or O
planting O
pots O
together O

Congratulations O
on O
your O
book O
, O
I O
will O
check O
it O
out O

How O
many O
doctors O
and O
specialists O
have O
you O
seen O
and O
how O
many O
tests O
have O
you O
had O
to O
go O
through O
to O
rule O
all O
those O
out O
I O
m O
just O
exhausted O
from O
paying O
out O
money O
to O
test O
all O
these O
things O
, O
waiting O
for O
the O
results O
and O
hoping O
it O
will O
be O
diagnosed O
with O
SOMETHING O
, O
and O
then O
being O
told O
your O
tests O
came O
out O
normal O
D O
. O
It O
s O
crazy O
that O
I O
want O
to O
hear O
I O
have O
something O
so O
I O
can O
treat O
it O
. O
Thanks O
for O
writing O
this O
out O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
have O
luck O
in O
finding O
your O
source O
of O
the O
problem O
better O
than O
I O
have O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
I O
am O
under O
their O
care O
until O
May O
2019 O
. O

I O
don O
t O
believe O
it O
possible O
to O
overdose O
, O
you O
can O
get O
over O
treated O
but O
that O
if O
you O
taking O
extra O
everyday O
for O
a O
consistent O
amount O
of O
time O
4-6 O
weeks O
If O
you O
took O
extra O
by O
mistake O
your O
system O
will O
just O
take O
what O
it O
needs O
and O
the O
rest O
wouldn O
t O
effect O
it O
Atleast O
that O
how O
my O
doc O
explain O
it O
to O
me O

Yes O
totally O
. O
It O
fluctuates O
w O
my O
lady O
cycle O
. O

I O
have O
so O
much O
trouble O
with O
self-esteem O
; O
I O
find O
it O
easier O
to O
rely O
on O
self-efficacy O
. O
I O
learn O
to O
do O
a O
small O
task O
well O
, O
I O
think O
that O
maybe O
I O
could O
also O
do O
a O
slightly O
more O
difficult O
related O
task O
. O
It O
amounts O
to O
I O
believe O
I O
am O
capable O
and O
competent O
over O
time O
, O
and O
it O
can O
tie O
into O
feelings B-DIS
of I-DIS
worthiness I-DIS
that O
people O
call O
self-esteem O
. O
I O
guess O
self-efficacy O
is O
based O
on O
facts O
I O
can O
point O
out O
to O
myself O
remember O
, O
you O
did O
a O
thing O
just O
like O
this O
before O
and O
it O
was O
successful O
, O
and O
for O
me O
that O
can O
be O
more O
reliable O
than O
feelings O
. O

When O
you O
have O
a O
low B-DIS
level I-DIS
of I-DIS
consciousness I-DIS
you O
tend O
to O
be O
hypersensitive B-DIS
to O
other O
people O
. O
You O
constantly O
judge O
other O
people O
. O
It O
s O
tribalism O
. O
We O
are O
very O
much O
the O
naked O
apes O
. O
Life O
is O
boring O
and O
lonely O
. O
However O
if O
you O
trigger O
, O
activate O
the O
inner O
chimp O
, O
others O
around O
you O
then O
you O
can O
feed O
off O
that O
energy O
. O
Like O
a O
psychic O
vampire O
or O
something O
. O
The O
problem O
however O
is O
that O
they O
can O
become O
violent O
. O

Both O
my O
grandparents O
have O
dementia B-DIS
. O
I O
never O
really O
got O
to O
know O
them O
when O
I O
was O
growing O
up O
, O
but O
now O
I O
look O
after O
them O
a O
few O
days O
a O
week O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
what O
they O
were O
like O
before O
, O
but O
now O
they O
re O
so O
angry B-DIS
, O
bitter B-DIS
and I-DIS
self-centered I-DIS
that O
I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
sympathizing O
. O
They O
spend O
all O
day O
and O
most O
of O
the O
night O
arguing O
over O
mundane O
little O
things O
. O
My O
grandma O
gets O
significantly O
worse B-DIS
at I-DIS
night I-DIS
, O
often O
throwing O
things O
and O
shrieking O
at O
the O
top O
of O
her O
lungs O
. O
She O
ignores O
or O
refuses O
to O
acknowledge O
that O
my O
grandpa O
is O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
. O
Despite O
the O
fact O
that O
someone O
s O
always O
there O
to O
take O
care O
of O
them O
, O
if O
she O
needs O
anything O
she O
yells O
at O
him O
to O
do O
it O
, O
then O
belittles O
him O
for O
not O
being O
able O
to O
. O
When O
we O
explain O
that O
the O
person O
*sitting O
in O
a O
wheelchair O
right O
in O
front O
of O
her* O
can O
t O
walk O
, O
she O
casually O
goes O
oh O
, O
I O
forgot O
. O
She O
calls O
him O
stupid O
, O
useless O
, O
and O
threatens O
to O
throw O
him O
in O
a O
nursing O
home O
heh O
. O
My O
uncle O
spends O
all O
week O
taking O
care O
of O
them O
luckily O
he O
works O
from O
home O
, O
but O
the O
minute O
he O
takes O
off O
for O
the O
weekend O
until O
the O
minute O
he O
gets O
back O
, O
she O
s O
moaning O
that O
he O
doesn O
t O
give O
a O
damn O
about O
us O
, O
he O
never O
visits O
or O
calls O
. O
She O
barely O
acknowledges O
that O
my O
mom O
who O
works O
equally O
hard O
to O
care O
for O
them O
exists O
, O
even O
when O
she O
s O
there O
. O
My O
grandpa O
s O
less O
aggressive B-DIS
, O
but O
has O
an O
equally O
bad B-DIS
attitude I-DIS
. O
He O
expects O
everyone O
to O
jump O
up O
and O
fix O
every O
little O
thing O
that O
s O
out O
of O
place O
a O
piece O
of O
lint O
on O
the O
carpet O
, O
a O
newspaper O
on O

the O
*wrong O
end* O
of O
a O
small O
table O
. O
He O
never O
says O
please O
or O
thank O
you O
-- O
the O
only O
response O
you O
get O
when O
you O
do O
anything O
for O
him O
is O
barking O
another O
order O
at O
you O
. O
When O
I O
step O
out O
of O
the O
room O
, O
he O
thinks O
he O
s O
whispering O
his O
complaints O
about O
me O
to O
my O
grandma O
, O
but O
he O
s O
deaf B-DIS
so O
he O
s O
practically O
shouting O
. O
He O
ll O
smile O
to O
my O
face O
and O
say O
I O
m O
number O
one O
, O
then O
turn O
around O
and O
tell O
my O
uncle O

apparently O
I O

not O
waiting O

satisfaction O
. O
TL O
; O
DR O
I O
don O
t O
really O
deal O
with O
it O
, O
I O
just O
do O
my O
best O
to O
ignore O
them O
while O
I O
clean O
, O
cook O
, O
administer O
medication B-DRUG
and O
change O
their O
diapers O
and O
they O
sit O
in O
the O
other O
room O
muttering O
that O
nobody O
cares O
about O
them O

I O
m O
having O
real O
trouble B-DIS
focusing I-DIS
today O
, O
so O
I O
apologize O
if O
I O
missed O
something O
obvious O
. O
It O
seems O
like O
they O
did O
a O
statistical O
comparison O
of O
the O
two O
groups O
, O
but O
did O
not O
indicate O
the O
accuracy O
of O
this O
test O
for O
individuals O
. O
How O
many O
positives O
among O
the O
controls O
, O
and O
how O
many O
negatives O
among O
the O
CFSers B-DIS
It O
seems O
like O
this O
should O
be O
the O
first O
thing O
they O
should O
highlight O
in O
their O
conclusions O
, O
when O
they O
use O
the O
word O
biomarker O
in O
the O
title O
. O

Most O
things O
sugar O
unless O
tiny O
quantities O
I O
will O
have O
to O
pay O
back O
with O
pain B-DIS
. O
Sugary O
carbonated O
drinks O
are O
the O
worst O
. O
Haven O
t O
had O
a O
coke O
in O
3 O
years O
, O
and O
I O
still O
miss O
the O
taste O

thanks O
... O
he O
has O
seen O
a O
urologist O
in O
the O
past O
... O
that O
was O
when O
he O
was O
getting O
them O
once O
a O
year.. O
they O
say O
he O
s O
just O
prone O
to O
them O
. O
.. O
but O
not O
sure O
if O
he O
s O
ever O
seen O
a O
nephrologist O
, O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
check O
... O
he O
doesn O
t O
want O
to O
waste O
money O
on O
our O
deductible O
, O
but O
I O
think O
that O
s O
just O
an O
excuse O
... O
I O
want O
him O
to O
at O
least O
have O
an O
xray O
to O
see O
how O
many O
are O
still O
there O
... O
he O
needs O
to O
do O
something O
... O
I O
m O
really O
worried O
about O
the O
amounts O
. O

I O
feel O
ya O
man O
... O
.from O
my O
last O
surgery O

I O
have O
two O
dogs O
. O
My O
partner O
also O
lives O
with O
me O
and O
he O
s O
great O
. O
But O
if O
I O
didn O
t O
have O
him O
I O
think O
the O
dogs O
could O
stave O
off O
the O
most O
crippling O
aspects O
of O
depression B-DIS
. O
One O
of O
them O
has O
before O
. O
She O
s O
why O
I O
m O
still O
here O
. O

Honestly O
I O
don O
t O
mind O
- O
I O
would O
rather O
forget O
. O
All O
it O
does O
every O
day O
remind O
me O
of O
what O
s O
been O
lost O
. O
My O
creative O
outlet O
was O
engineering O
... O
it O
was O
my O
art O
. O
It O
s O
gone O
. O
All O
gone O
. O

Ps- O
good O
luck O
with O
your O
journey O

Reach O
out O
to O
me O
if O
you O
need O
any O
support O
. O
After O
a O
tough O
couple O
of O
years O
, O
I O
finally O
got O
my O
mother O
into O
an O
assisted O
living O
facility O
this O
week O
. O
She O
is O
by O
far O
the O
youngest O
at O
66 O
. O

Great O
game O
, O
actually O
reignited O
that O
sense O
of O
adventure O
and O
mystery O
. O
My O
problem O
with O
TP O
, O
and O
Skyward O
Sword O
, O
was O
it O
was O
all O
too O
samey O
. O
This O
one O
is O
far O
more O
new O
and O
has O
enough O
changes O
to O
keep O
things O
from O
being O
predictable O
. O
Also O
, O
being O
open O
world O
, O
I O
feel O
it O
s O
good O
game O
for O
lengthy O
stays O
in O
El O
bano O
. O

I O
m O
in O
the O
same O
situation O
. O
I O
compare O
my O
life O
to O
that O
of O
prisoners O
living O
out O
life O
sentences O
. O
You O
ll O
never O
get O
out O
or O
have O
freedom O
again O
and O
you O
have O
to O
live O
inside O
your O
head O
alone O
knowing O
that O
. O
Forever O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
start O
to O
feel O
better O
. O
Sending O
positive O
energy O
and O
lots O
of O
love O
. O

Thanks O
Writing O
with O
patience O
takes O
time O
to O
learn O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
writing O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
. O
But O
there O
s O
also O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
other O
writing O
styles O
and O
sometimes O
that O
expresses O
emotions O
more O
directly O
as O
well O
. O
In O
sum O
, O
write O
no O
matter O
what O
It O
will O
only O
make O
your O
thoughts O
and O
writing O
better O
. O

Because O
depression B-DIS
isn O
t O
a O
state O
of O

Hi O
, O
I O
m O
in O
the O
hospital O
too O
, O
just O
awaiting O
surgery O
. O
I O
hope O
that O
whatever O
path O
you O
take O
is O
the O
best O
outcome O
for O
you O
Sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
the O
med O
insurance O
issues O
That O
s O
terrible O
and O
no O
person O
should O
have O
to O
suffer O
literally O
physically O
suffer O
terribly O
because O
companies O
and O
others O
can O
t O
get O
their O
shit O
together O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
tip O
regarding O
the O
NG O
tube O
. O
Not O
sure O
if O
I O
ll O
get O
one O
, O
but O
they O
ll O
probably O
place O
it O
while O
I O
m O
asleep O
after O
surgery O
. O
Best O
of O
luck O
Hope O
you O
recuperate O
soon O

I O
agree O
with O
many O
posters O
on O
here O
. O
You O
don O
t O
have O
POTS B-DIS
but O
your O
autonomic B-DIS
nervous I-DIS
system I-DIS
is I-DIS
acting I-DIS
wacky I-DIS
probably O
as O
a O
way O
to O
compensate O
for O
something O
going O
on O
. O
Have O
you O
had O
an O
echocardiogram O
done O

Is O
she O
diagnosed O
Does O
she O
have O
a O
caretaker O
24 O
7 O
If O
receipts O
don O
t O
appease O
her O
or O
she O
forgets O
where O
she O
put O
them O
maybe O
take O
a O
picture O
of O
her O
at O
the O
store O
Or O
get O
her O
a O
notebook O
where O
she O
writes O
down O
what O
she O
did O
that O
day O
as O
she O
does O
it O
, O
you O
ll O
have O
to O
remind O
her O
all O
the O
time O
but O
having O
it O
in O
her O
writing O
might O
help O
. O

One O
person O
I O
knew O
who O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
BPD B-DIS
only O
said O
topomax B-DRUG
helped O
them O
. O
Apparently O
there O
was O
a O
theory O
out O
there O
that O
BPD B-DIS
involved O
brain B-DIS
seizures I-DIS
in O
a O
different O
part O
of O
the O
brain O
than O
the O
typical O
seizures B-DIS
. O
Also O
BPD B-DIS
seems O
to O
be O
a O
combination O
of O
biological O
and O
behavioral O
components O
. O
So O
while O
medications O
might O
not O
be O
effective O
for O
some O
, O
I O
wouldn O
t O
outright O
dismiss O
them O
either O
. O
Nothing O
is O
really O
that O
well O
understood O
at O
this O
point O
, O
new O
data O
keeps O
coming O
in O
. O
Either O
way O
, O
whether O
the O
individual O
is O
diagnosed O
with O
comorbid B-DIS
disorders I-DIS
or O
not O
, O
I O
think O
medication O
is O
still O
something O
to O
consider O
as O
an O
option O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
through O
a O
move O
while O
doing O
a O
divorce O
. O
My O
best O
advice O
is O
twofold O
be O
as O
kind O
as O
you O
can O
to O
your O
SO O
to O
prevent O
divorce O
and O
even O
openly O
talk O
about O
it O
with O
them O
. O
Give O
them O
the O
option O
if O
you O
feel O
they O
want O
out O
. O
With O
regard O
to O
the O
move O
just O
break O
it O
down O
into O
manageable O
pieces O
with O
lots O
of O
lists O
and O
breaks O
. O
Good O
luck O

I O
have O
some O
lavender B-DRUG
essential I-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
which O
I O
use O
to O
relax O
, O
and O
you O
can O
just O
dab O
it O
on O
your O
temples O
or O
whatever O
. O
It O
just O
smells O
nice O
, O
I O
m O
not O
sure O
it O
s O
LIFE O
CHANGING O
but O
it O
at O
least O
helps O
a O
lil O
bit O

Keep O
playing O
the O
long O
game O
. O
Tell O
your O
dad O
that O
with O
some O
more O
help O
he O
will O
be O
able O
to O
enjoy O
some O
much O
needed O
alone O
time O
without O
putting O
her O
in O
danger O
. O
Being O
able O
to O
afford O
home O
care O
if O
a O
blessing O
that O
many O
don O
t O
have O
. O
He O
should O
use O
it O
. O
Maybe O
next O
time O
you O
visit O
you O
can O
help O
him O
interview O
nurses O
caretakers O
. O
It O
can O
be O
overwhelming O
. O
Your O
dad O
needs O
to O
agree O
that O
he O
needs O
help O
though O
. O
Keep O
reminding O
him O
, O
every O
push O
helps O
. O
Best O
of O

Two O
weeks O
My O
gastroenterologist O
said O
I O
have O
to O
be O
on O
it O
for O
LIFE O
. O
According O
to O
him O
, O
there O
is O
no O
cure O
, O
just O
maintenance O
treatment O
. O
I O
was O
on O
it O
for O
six O
months O
, O
tried O
to O
come O
off O
of O
it O
and O
, O
within O
two O
months O
, O
was O
back O
to O
square O
one O
. O
You O
do O
definitely O
need O
real O
testing O
radioactive O
eggs O
to O
get O
a O
definitive O
diagnosis O
, O
but O
, O
as O
per O
my O
GI O
, O
treatment O
is O
for O
life O
. O

What O
are O
some O
things O
you O
think O
are O
a O
problem O
in O
your O
life O

It O
sounds O
similar O
to O
here O
Canada O
. O
It O
is O
available O
for O
medical O
conditions O
as O
well O
though O
some O
physicians O
do O
not O
yet O
believe O
the O
benefits O
. O
The O
specifics O
legal O
, O
medical O
, O
political O
, O
and O
perceptions O
are O
still O
being O
worked O
out O
too O
. O
It O
is O
interesting O
we O
have O
an O
old O
chocolate O
factory O
is O
now O
being O
used O
as O
a O
medical B-DRUG
marijuana I-DRUG
grow O
facility O
near O
here O
in O
town O
. O

Just O
varies O
by O
person O
, O
I O
guess O
. O
My O
having O
a O
really O
high O
tolerance O
might O
also O
be O
a O
factor O
, O
takes O
like O
6-7 O
shots O
before O
anyone O
can O
tell O
I O
ve O
had O
anything O
to O
drink O
. O

Me O
too O
. O
I O
am O
not O
lazy O
by O
any O
stretch O
of O
the O
imagination O
. O
I O
love O
to O
be O
busy O
working O
hard O
. O
But O
it O
is O
so O
hard O
to O
convince O
myself O
that O
it O
s O
worth O
it O
for O
me O
to O
even O
get O
up O
. O
The O
stupid O
thing O
is O
, O
I O
feel O
so O
much O
better O
when O
I O
am O
out O
doing O
things O
. O
But O
for O
some O
reason O
I O
can O
t O
get O
that O
first O
step O
accomplished O
. O

I O
would O
recommend O
going O
to O
a O
motility O
specialist O
if O
you O
haven O
t O
already O
. O
I O
tried O
my O
local O
gis O
and O
they O
could O
to O
nothing O
to O
help O
me O
. O
Even O
when O
I O
went O
to O
the O
motility O
specialist O
, O
it O
was O
trial O
and O
error O
but O
the O
guy O
knew O
what O
he O
was O
talking O
about O
and O
understood O
. O
Zofran B-DRUG
really O
didn O
t O
do O
anything O
for O
nausea B-DIS
what O
really O
helped O
is O
a O
patch O
replaced O
once O
a O
week O
called O
sancuso B-DRUG
. O
It O
can O
be O
hard O
to O
get O
approved O
but O
well O
worth O
it O

I O
take O
one O
at O
3 O
30am O
I O
work O
early O
. O
2nd O
one O
around O
3 O
30pm O
. O
On O
non O
work O
days O
, O
I O
have O
a O
bit O
of O
coffee O
in O
the O
morning O
if O
I O
m O
fatigued B-DIS
then O
the O
medication O
around O
8 O
9am O
. O
It O
tends O
to O
last O
the O
whole O
day O
without O
the O
need O
for O
a O
second O
dose O
. O
200mg O
is O
the O
strength O
for O
mine O
. O

I O
had O
the O
same O
young O
and O
foolish O
moment O
. O
I O
m O
lucky O
enough O
that O
I O
don O
t O
need O
to O
replace O
my O
joints O
just O
yet O
. O
Did O
you O
have O
a O
certain O
point O
in O
your O
healing O
where O
you O
felt O
strong O
enough O
to O
have O
children O
My O
husband O
and O
I O
have O
been O
talking O
about O
children O
, O
but O
I O
m O
afraid O
to O
lose O
the O
progress O
I O
ve O
made O
and O
further O
damage B-DIS
my I-DIS
joints I-DIS
. O

Have O
you O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
sponge B-DIS
kidney I-DIS
I O
started O
getting O
stones B-DIS
when O
I O
was O
13 O
in O
also O
have O
passed O
roughly O
150ish O
stones B-DIS
. O
So O
many O
surgeries O
I O
can O
keep O
track O
anymore O
. O
I O
have O
a O
1 O
inch O
stone B-DIS
right O
now O
and O
going O
for O
my O
second O
surgery O
in O
a O
two O
week O
time O
period O
on O
Friday O
. O
Its O
awful O
and O
I O
just O
found O
out O
that O
nothing O
I O
do O
dietary O
wise O
will O
help O
me O
because O
I O
have O
sponge B-DIS
kidney I-DIS
. O

I O
have O
near-constant O
tinnitus B-DIS
, O
but O
thankfully O
only O
in O
my O
left O
ear O
. O
When O
it O
s O
at O
its O
worst O
, O
the O
only O
thing O
I O
can O
do O
is O
, O
oddly O
, O
listen O
to O
something O
. O
I O
ve O
gotten O
to O
the O
point O
where O
virtually O
all O
of O
the O
pleasure O
reading O
I O
do O
is O
actually O
listening O
to O
audiobooks O
. O
For O
whatever O
reason O
, O
I O
can O
power O
through O
the O
ringing B-DIS
roaring B-DIS
listening O
to O
someone O
else O
read O
. O
A O
life-saver O
for O
me O
has O
been O
my O
local O
public O
library O
and O
Overdrive O

He O
ll O
have O
to O
put O
a O
new O
pod O
on O
. O

No O
, O
usually O
I O
am O
so O
relieved O
and O
elated O
I O
jump O
right O
back O
into O
life O
. O

I O
ve O
had O
pretty O
bad O
experiences O
with O
antidepressants O
personally O
, O
some O
made O
me O
feel B-DIS
numb I-DIS
no O
emotions O
at O
all O
and O
others O
made O
me O
throw B-DIS
up I-DIS
and O
feel B-DIS
absolutely I-DIS
terrible I-DIS
despite O
trying O
to O
stick O
it O
out O
. O
If O
you O
have O
periods O
of O
anxiety B-DIS
I O
have O
found O
that O
ativan B-DRUG
I O
take O
.5mg O
helps O
a O
ton O
, O
and O
it O
also O
helps O
the O
nausea B-DIS
too O

I O
didn O
t O
try O
any O
medication O
while O
pregnant O
. O
Everything O
was O
just O
assumed O
complications O
of O
pregnancy O
and O
really O
didn O
t O
become O
that O
bad O
until O
the O
ninth O
month O
, O
and O
then O
I O
was O
induced O
. O

Indeed O
, O
autoimmune B-DIS
diseases I-DIS
like O
lupus B-DIS
or O
other O
ones O
there O
are O
quite O
a O
few O
can O
cause O
frequent O
illnesses O
as O
well O
as O
cause O
POTS B-DIS
. O
It O
s O
considered O
secondary B-DIS
POTS I-DIS
. O
I O
m O
being O
tested O
for O
both O
right O
now O
and O
I O
also O
suffer O
frequent B-DIS
infections I-DIS
and O
chronic B-DIS
fatigue I-DIS
. O

After O
the O
first O
surgery B-DIS
I O
was O
sure O
it O
was O
a O
bad O
luck O
and O
I O
didn O
t O
want O
drugs O
since O
I O
had O
no O
symptoms O
. O
After O
the O
second O
surgery B-DIS
I O
tried O
a O
few O
drugs O
Pentasa B-DRUG
didn O
t O
work O
, O
Prednisone B-DRUG
is O
good O
but O
you O
can O
t O
use O
it O
long O
term O
. O
Imuran B-DRUG
and O
6mp B-DRUG
I O
couldn O
t O
handle O
the O
side B-DIS
effects I-DIS
it O
made O
me O
sick B-DIS
, O
and O
since O
some O
of O
the O
issues O
I O
had O
before O
the O
2nd O
surgery B-DIS
was O
caused O
by O
adhesions B-DIS
from O
the O
first O
surgery O
... O
I O
ended O
with O
no O
medication O
. O
Then O
2 O
years O
ago O
, O
after O
getting O
sick O
, O
weak B-DIS
and O
they O
found O
a O
new B-DIS
stricture I-DIS
, O
my O
GI O
told O
me O
to O
start O
Humira B-DRUG
after O
the O
surgery O
, O
It O
s O
what O
I O
did O
. O
No O
side O
effects O
. O
And O
my O
last O
bowel O
exam O
was O
good O
. O
So O
fingers O
crossed O
for O
the O
coming O
years O
, O
I O
hope O
Humira B-DRUG
will O
continue O
to O
work O

Tell O
me O
how O
it O
works O
for O
you O
D O

head B-DIS
still I-DIS
hurts I-DIS
how O
bad O
will O
my O
hangover B-DIS
when O
i O
wake O
up O
be O
lmao O

I O
ve O
largely O
quit O
drinking O
and O
found O
that O
helped O
my O
GP B-DIS
immensely O
. O
Now O
if O
I O
have O
more O
than O
a O
few O
drinks O
they O
sit O
in O
my O
stomach O
overnight O
and O
it O
s O
a O
throw B-DIS
up I-DIS
party O
at O
4am O
. O

Hello O
, O
it O
can O
be O
unsettling O
to O
have O
a O
chronic B-DIS
disease I-DIS
. O
But O
hopefully O
, O
he O
and O
you O
can O
take O
a O
deep O
breath O
. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
28 O
years O
ago O
as O
a O
teenager O
and O
am O
now O
12 O
years O
older O
than O
your O
BF O
. O
I O
have O
had O
just O
one O
surgery B-DIS
6 O
years O
ago O
and O
a O
number O
of O
different O
flares B-DIS
, O
but O
this O
disease B-DIS
really O
hasn O
t O
gotten O
in O
the O
way O
of O
my O
life O
. O
I O
m O
in O
the O
US O
and O
enjoy O
traveling O
. O
We O
mostly O
drive O
around O
the O
United O
States O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
also O
been O
able O
to O
spend O
a O
month O
in O
Spain O
. O
I O
was O
in O
the O
boy O
scouts O
when O
I O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
and O
was O
still O
able O
to O
camp O
and O
hike O
just O
fine O
. O
Last O
summer O
, O
my O
family O
and O
I O
just O
spent O
a O
week O
near O
the O
Smokey O
Mountains O
. O
We O
hiked O
various O
waterfall O
trails O
three O
or O
four O
of O
the O
days O
we O
were O
there O
. O
Spent O
another O
day O
tubing O
down O
the O
river O
. O
We O
like O
to O
go O
boating O
and O
fishing O
a O
few O
times O
each O
summer O
also O
. O
There O
are O
other O
public O
figures O
that O
have O
come O
out O
about O
having O
IBD B-DIS
Larry O
Nance O
Jr O
with O
the O
LA O
Lakers O
NBA O
; O
Jake O
Diekman O
of O
the O
Texas O
Rangers O
MLB O
- O
just O
to O
name O
a O
couple O
of O
the O
most O
recent O
, O
vocal O
advocates O
. O
You O
can O
google O
search O
their O
stories O
. O
I O
also O
checked O
out O
your O
other O
thread O
... O
I O
love O
to O
cook O
, O
too O
Your O
BF O
will O
still O
be O
able O
to O
eat O
. O
Perhaps O
he O
will O
find O
that O
certain O
foods O
or O
spices O
don O
t O
agree O
with O
him O
like O
they O
used O
to O
... O
quite O
honestly O
, O
that O
can O
happen O
to O
anyone O
with O
age O
. O
I O
talk O
to O
my O
non-Crohn O
s O
friends O
and O
they O
have O
certain O
things O
they O
can O
not O
eat O
at O
all O
or O
in O

the O
quantities O
they O
used O
to O
when O
we O
were O
younger O
. O
For O
me O
, O
it O
is O
mostly O
spicy O
foods O
. O
I O
have O
found O
that O
it O
is O
tougher B-DIS
for I-DIS
me I-DIS
to I-DIS
digest I-DIS
certain I-DIS
cuts I-DIS
of I-DIS
beef I-DIS
, O
and O
mostly O
stay O
with O
chicken O
, O
pork O
, O
turkey O
, O
and O
fish O
. O
it O
is O
different O
for O
everyone O
Exercise O
does O
help O
. O
Even O
when O
I O
don O
t O
feel O
like O
it O
beforehand O
, O
when O
I O
force O
myself O
to O
do O
something O
, O
I O
always O
feel O
so O
much O
better O
afterwards O
. O
In O
addition O
to O
the O
physical O
benefits O
, O
it O
is O
always O
such O
a O
good O
stress O
relief O
for O
me O
. O
What O
I O
do O
for O
exercise O
has O
changed O
over O
the O
years O
, O
based O
on O
where O
I O
m O
at O
and O
what O
others O
in O
my O
life O
are O
doing O
for O
activity O
exercise O
pick-up O
basketball O
games O
, O
martial O
arts O
, O
walking O
jogging O
hiking O
, O
biking O
, O
gym O
equipment O
lifting O
, O
and O
most O
recent O
indoor O
rock O
wall O
climbing O
and O
bouldering O
. O
You O
can O
and O
will O
get O
through O
this O
together O
. O
Love O
, O
patience O
, O
and O
understanding O
, O
as O
you O
will O
need O
with O
any O
trial O
you O
face O
in O
life O
together O
. O

That O
s O
what O
I O
m O
concerned O
about O
, O
especially O
after O
this O
past O
year O
, O
which O
has O
been O
by O
far O
the O
worst O
. O
The O
first O
gastroenterologist O
I O
saw O
was O
absolutely O
fantastic O
, O
but O
I O
toughed O
it O
out O
the O
next O
two O
years O
, O
and O
then O
while O
living O
in O
New O
Orleans O
for O
a O
year O
I O
went O
to O
one O
there O
, O
who O
wasn O
t O
get O
good O
. O
Now O
my O
one O
in O
Houston O
has O
just O
retired O
this O
year O
, O
but O
I O
m O
hoping O
that O
since O
he O
s O
a O
friend O
of O
the O
family O
that O
he O
can O
at O
least O
give O
a O
recommend O
someone O
and O
give O
a O
consult O
on O
what O
he O
thinks O
. O
Now O
I O
just O
avoid O
heavy O
food O
and O
make O
sure O
to O
have O
liquid O
protein O
drinks O
during O
the O
day O
. O
Over O
the O
past O
few O
days O
I O
ve O
started O
swelling B-DIS
again O
, O
so O
I O
have O
a O
doctor O
s O
appointment O
tomorrow O
to O
go O
over O
everything O
. O

Yeah O
I O
ve O
never O
used O
Prelief B-DRUG
myself O
but O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
swear O
by O
it O
, O
especially O
if O
they O
re O
sensitive B-DIS
to I-DIS
diet I-DIS
. O
Good O
luck O
, O
I O
can O
t O
imagine O
having O
a O
bad B-DIS
flare I-DIS
and O
a O
newborn O
that O
must O
be O
so O
difficult O
. O
Hang O
in O
there O

Ya O
I O
m O
getting O
a O
ct O
scan O
tomm O
so O
we O
will O
see O
. O
Definitely O
not O
close O
to O
er O
level O
pain B-DIS
or O
committing O
. O
However O
I O
have O
been O
having O
some O
stomach B-DIS
issues I-DIS
like O
gas B-DIS
constipation B-DIS
so O
not O
sure O
if O
that O
s O
related O
. O

I O
think O
you O
re O
onto O
something O
with O
the O
throwing O
yourself O
out O
there O
and O
trying O
not O
to O
overthink O
it O
, O
but O
I O
also O
know O
how O
difficult O
it O
is O
to O
not O
overthink O
it O
. O
Perhaps O
you O
could O
try O
setting O
certain O
goals O
for O
yourself O
so O
that O
instead O
of O
trying O
not O
to O
think O
you O
can O
divert O
it O
you O
re O
thinking O
to O
something O
more O
productive O
For O
instance O
, O
coming O
up O
with O
activities O
on O
your O
own O
for O
you O
and O
friends O
to O
do O
in O
setting O
certain O
goals O
like O
oh O
I O
want O
to O
make O
sure O
we O
go O
to O
this O
at O
this O
time O
but O
then O
also O
understand O
that O
plans O
can O
change O
and O
maybe O
somebody O
comes O
up O
with O
something O
that O
you O
guys O
decide O
will O
be O
more O
fun O
whatever O
things O
can O
be O
flexible O
but O
if O
you O
divert O
your O
attention O
to O
more O
productive O
things O
I O
think O
that O
would O
help O
you O
more O
than O
just O
trying O
not O
to O
think O

When O
I O
had O
it O
done O
it O
was O
in O
a O
room O
and O
you O
just O
had O
to O
stand O
in O
between O
two O
paddles O
as O
they O
took O
x-rays O
every O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
interval O
. O
If O
there O
was O
still O
a O
considerable O
amount O
of O
the O
radioactive B-DRUG
stuff I-DRUG
the O
food O
you O
had O
to O
eat O
after O
the O
2 O
hour O
mark O
, O
then O
you O
had O
to O
stay O
until O
4 O
hours O
. O
Mine O
lasted O
4 O
hours O
because O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
food O
was O
still O
in O
there O
Gastroparesis B-DIS
was O
diagnosed O
. O

I O
think O
it O
s O
common O
. O
I O
m O
dealing O
with O
it O
a O
bit O
now O
. O
Huge O
case O
of O
the O
fuck O
it O
s. O
poor B-DIS
decision I-DIS
making I-DIS
with O
limited O
cause O
and O
effect O
understanding O
. O
I O
used O
to O
rely O
on O
having O
a O
steady O
routine O
but O
now O
married O
with O
kids O
they O
destroy O
any O
semblance O
of O
a O
routine O
. O
Hold O
off O
on O
decision O
making O
until O
you O
feel O
more O
on O
keel O
. O

He O
just O
refuses B-DIS
to I-DIS
get I-DIS
up I-DIS
- O
he O
sleeps B-DIS
a I-DIS
lot I-DIS
. O
I O
work O
from O
home O
and O
take O
him O
breakfast O
so O
I O
m O
not O
disrupting O
work O
time O
and O
he O
gets O
annoyed O
to O
hear O
me O
speaking O
authoritatively O
on O
conference O
calls O
because O
, O
in O
his O
mind O
, O
if O
there O
is O
a O
meeting O
he O
is O
the O
one O
who O
should O
be O
the O
boss O
... O
. O
I O
can O
not O
remember O
the O
last O
time O
he O
came O
down O
for O
lunch O
and O
dinner O
also O
needs O
to O
be O
taken O
to O
him O
on O
a O
tray O
. O
For O
a O
while O
he O
was O
acting O
like O
he O
s O
staying O
in O
a O
badly O
run O
boarding O
house O
and O
once O
asked O
me O
how O
I O
came O
to O
be O
in O
the O
hospitality O
industry O
... O
as O
he O
is O
a O
bit O
of O
a O
snob O
I O
think O
he O
was O
choosing O
to O
not O
eat O
with O
the O
help O
. O
I O
have O
had O
a O
hard O
time O
getting O
him O
to O
get O
up O
to O
go O
to O
doctor O
appointments O
also O
. O
I O
just O
got O
guardianship O
and O
he O
refused O
to O
get O
up O
for O
the O
visit O
from O
the O
social O
worker O
and O
the O
court-appointed O
lawyer O
, O
too O
. O
He O
was O
seen O
by O
a O
PT O
and O
an O
OT O
who O
could O
not O
find O
any O
reason O
for O
this O
. O
What O
I O
am O
a O
bit O
concerned O
about O
is O
his O
hernia B-DIS
- O
I O
need O
to O
take O
him O
in O
to O
see O
the O
surgeon O
and O
get O
him O
scheduled O
for O
a O
surgery O
- O
but O
I O
ve O
been O
having O
such O
a O
hard O
time O
getting O
him O
up O
I O
don O
t O
know O
how O
I O
ll O
get O
him O
to O
the O
operation O
. O

No O
problem O
, O
I O
really O
hope O
this O
helps O
Yes O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
most O
people O
, O
especially O
in O
early O
stages O
, O
are O
very O
aware O
that O
something O
is O
worng O
with O
them O
. O
From O
what O
I O
expirienced O
, O
and O
also O
, O
what O
a O
lot O
of O
theories O
state O
, O
is O
that O
most O
of O
the O
strange B-DIS
behaviour I-DIS
in O
this O
stage O
is O
caused O
by O
their O
efforts O
to O
hide O
this O
. O
But O
, O
of O
course O
, O
it O
is O
nearly O
impossible O
to O
admit O
that O
, O
especially O
to O
the O
family O
. O
Telling O
you O
daughter O
that O
you O
are O
scared B-DIS
and O
don O
t O
know O
what O
s O
going O
on O
must O
feel O
horrible O
, O
that O
s O
why O
they O
rather O
not O
. O
Even O
I O
as O
someone O
with O
no O
past O
with O
them O
or O
my O
collegues O
need O
to O
build O
a O
really O
high O
level O
of O
trust O
and O
have O
to O
act O
really O
professional O
, O
and O
even O
then O
only O
a O
minjority O
of O
people O
actually O
talk O
about O
those O
feelings O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
. O
Oh O
yes O
, O
you O
don O
t O
even O
wan O
na O
know O
what O
kind O
of O
behaviour O
some O
other O
people O
develop O
, O
it O
s O
really O
interesting O
what O
kind O
of O
desires O
or O
coping O
methods O
seem O
to O
come O
out O
when O
some O
blockades B-DIS
in I-DIS
the I-DIS
brain I-DIS
dissapear O
. O
I O
guess O
my O
all O
time O
favourite O
will O
always O
be O
I O
m O
an O
orthopedic O
insulin B-DRUG
specialist O

My O
tinnitus B-DIS
pitch O
is O
6khz O
and O
I O
have O
Meniere O
s. O
Low O
frequency O
might O
be O
an O
indicator O
, O
but O
that O
is O
not O
necessarily O
the O
case O
... O

At O
this O
point O
salvation O
is O
equal O
to O
suicide O
for O
me O
to O
be O
honest O
, O
so O
... O

LOL O
Oh O
god O
... O
Sorry O
. O
Man O
you O
are O
a O
lucky O
bastard O
. O
I O
came O
here O
looking O
for O
the O
remember O
when O
they O
were O
twice O
as O
big O
and O
literally O
took O
all O
day O
too O
get O
down O
comment O
and O
here O
you O
are O
, O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
your O
journey O
, O
viewing O
that O
long O
path O
before O
you O
going O
... O
Oh O
. O
This O
isn O
t O
easy O
Hugs O
. O

Yes O
, O
you O
are O
not O
alone O
and O
I O
know O
how O
it O
feels O
. O
You O
will O
be O
in O
my O
prayers O
. O
Stay O
strong O

Thank O
you O
for O
sharing O

What O
you O
re O
describing O
sounds O
like O
what O
I O
dealt O
with O
when O
I O
was O
younger O
. O
You O
may O
just O
have O
a O
more O
mild O
case O
of O
IBS B-DIS
. O
I O
had O
the O
same O
symptoms O
until O
5 O
years O
ago O
or O
so O
, O
when O
I O
went O
through O
a O
period O
of O
extreme B-DIS
stress I-DIS
and O
my O
symptoms O
worsened O
. O
Things O
have O
been O
bad O
ever O
since O
, O
though O
I O
m O
finally O
starting O
to O
get O
a O
handle O
on O
it O
again O
. O
It O
was O
actually O
my O
therapist O
who O
mentioned O
that O
I O
might O
have O
IBS B-DIS
. O
Even O
though O
your O
case O
is O
mild O
now O
, O
you O
should O
still O
try O
low O
FODMAP O
and O
see O
if O
you O
can O
isolate O
the O
foods O
that O
aggravate O
your O
condition O
. O
Avoiding O
those O
foods O
as O
and O
keeping O
your O
stress B-DIS
anxiety B-DIS
under O
control O
as O
much O
as O
possible O
may O
help O
keep O
your O
symptoms O
mild O
or O
even O
eliminate O
them O
and O
hopefully O
prevent O
a O
worse O
time O
down O
the O
road O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
ve O
had O
similar O
feedback O
from O
docs O
too O
. O
Sorry O
, O
no O
help O
on O
getting O
it O
cheaply O
. O
In O
my O
country O
I O
get O
a O
script O
from O
my O
dr O
and O
it O
s O
funded O
so O
it O
s O
about O
5 O
for O
120 O
2mg O
pills O
. O

A O
fever B-DIS
is O
a O
bad O
sign O
. O
It O
s O
usually O
an O
indication O
of O
an O
infection B-DIS
and O
is O
one O
of O
the O
major O
complications O
that O
can O
arise O
as O
a O
result O
of O
kidney B-DIS
stones I-DIS
. O
You O
don O
t O
want O
to O
risk O
a O
kidney B-DIS
infection I-DIS
going O
undiagnosed O
and O
untreated O
. O
If O
it O
were O
just O
pain B-DIS
I O
d O
say O
tough O
it O
out O
until O
you O
can O
get O
an O
appointment O
with O
a O
urologists O
, O
but O
if O
you O
have O
secondary O
symptoms O
, O
especially O
fever B-DIS
, O
I O
say O
get O
to O
the O
ER O
. O

I O
figured O
it O
out O
mostly O
by O
thinking O
about O
the O
future O
. O
I O
asked O
myself O
if O
I O
could O
handle O
these O
problems O
and O
this O
relationship O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
and O
the O
answer O
was O
no O
. O
Then O
I O
also O
thought O
about O
if O
the O
problems O
were O
because O
of O
the O
person O
being O
themselves O
or O
because O
of O
outside O
factors O
and O
most O
of O
our O
problems O
were O
the O
former O
. O

I O
find O
I O
do O
better O
when O
I O
eat O
low O
carb O
keto O
meat O
, O
low O
fiber O
, O
as O
little O
bread O
as O
possible O
. O
It O
s O
not O
easy O
, O
but O
I O
definitely O
feel O
better O
when O
I O
do O
hold O
to O
it O
. O

My O
wife O
made O
me O
business O
cards O
that O
gives O
a O
quick O
explanation O
of O
my O
symptoms O
and O
who O
to O
call O
if O
I O
need O
help O
. O
I O
can O
come O
off O
as O
an O
ass O
sometimes O
due O
to O
what O
we O
call O
a O
lewy B-DIS
loop I-DIS
. O
The O
other O
day O
I O
was O
at O
the O
grocery O
store O
and O
left O
with O
my O
stuff O
only O
to O
realize O
in O
the O
parking O
lot O
that O
I O
forgot B-DIS
to I-DIS
pay I-DIS
. O

I O
m O
glad O
you O
found O
something O
that O
is O
giving O
you O
some O
relief O
. O
IBS B-DIS
can O
be O
hell O
. O
Have O
you O
tried O
the O
low O
FODMAP O
diet O
before O
I O
found O
the O
best O
relief O
with O
following O
low O
FODMAP O
. O
It O
surprises O
me O
that O
meat O
has O
always O
caused O
flare B-DIS
ups I-DIS
for O
you O
- O
was O
it O
spiced O
with O
onion O
and O
or O
garlic O
or O
like O
a O
plain O
chicken O
breast O
Just O
curious O
. O
Did O
you O
see O
a O
dietician O
and O
a O
gastroenterologist O
as O
part O
of O
your O
IBS B-DIS
diagnosis O
and O
follow O
up O
care O
plan O
Western O
medicine O
is O
what O
has O
been O
helping O
me O
, O
because O
low O
FODMAP O
is O
based O
on O
continuing O
scientific O
research O
and O
testing O
of O
individual O
foods O
. O
It O
is O
upsetting O
to O
me O
that O
you O
were O
never O
given O
dietary O
advice O
from O
your O
care O
team O
in O
order O
to O
help O
manage O
your O
chronic O
condition O
. O

All O
fake O
news O
anyway O

This O
is O
actually O
very O
helpful O
. O
Thank O
you O

Squatty O
potty O
is O
awesome O
, O
and O
if O
you O
really O
wan O
na O
poop O
in O
style O
, O
add O
a O
bidet O
. O
Really O
saves O
you O
on O
the O
days O
that O
you O
re O
in O
and O
out O
of O
the O
bathroom O
. O

Yeah O
I O
mean O
I O
considered O
this O
. O
Except O
that O
it O
s O
usually O
when O
I O
m O
sitting O
down O
. O
When O
I O
get O
like O
lower B-DIS
blood I-DIS
pressure I-DIS
I O
get O
a O
ringing B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
ears I-DIS
and O
can O
t O
focus O
at O
all O
. O
But O
when O
this O
happens O
it O
s O
pretty O
much O
I O
just O
can O
t O
work O
out O
what O
a O
word O
is O
, O
and O
without O
that O
word O
it O
won O
t O
fit O
into O
a O
sentence.. O

Okay O
. O

I O
am O
Type B-DIS
1 I-DIS
who O
loves O
to O
bake O
and O
also O
has O
a O
sweet O
tooth O
. O
We O
can O
eat O
anything O
as O
long O
as O
we O
cover O
enough O
insulin B-DRUG
for O
it O
. O
Type B-DIS
1 I-DIS
doesn O
t O
really O
follow O
many O
of O
the O
stereotypes O
of O
diabetes B-DIS
, O
and O
a O
lot O
can O
be O
meant O
by O
her O
saying O
she O
s O
usually O
higher O
. O
Most O
likely O
, O
it O
means O
that O
she O
doesn O
t O
go O
low O
often O
. O

The O
ingredients O
are O
legal O
in O
the O
U.S O
. O
I O
have O
a O
prescription O
for O
betahistine B-DRUG
dihydrochloride I-DRUG
that O
I O
have O
to O
have O
filled O
at O
a O
compounding O
pharmacy O
. O
I O
quit O
taking O
them O
6 O
months O
ago O
. O
No O
noticeable O
change O
at O
all O
. O

I O
m O
glad O
to O
know O
I O
m O
not O
the O
only O
primary O
care-giver O
who O
has O
this O
issue O
. O
Due O
to O
primarily O
primary-care-giver B-DIS
induced I-DIS
anxiety I-DIS
, O
I O
tend O
to O
wake O
up O
between O
4AM O
and O
5AM O
every O
day O
. O
As O
time O
has O
gone O
on O
, O
I O
savour O
this O
time O
where O
I O
can O
just O
be O
by O
myself O
. O
My O
wife O
will O
wake O
up O
super-early O
and O
try O
to O
dress O
herself O
. O
I O
sigh O
and O
then O
help O
her O
undress O
and O
get O
her O
back O
to O
bed O
. O
I O
like O
the O
idea O
of O
having O
an O
intuitive O
way O
for O
her O
to O
know O
if O
it O
s O
actually O
time O
to O
get O
up O
. O

Sorry O
im O
going O
to O
edit O
the O
protein O
part O
to O
read O
GRAMS O
not O
micrograms O
. O
100 O
grams O
of O
protein O
, O
at O
least O
. O

Maybe O
try O
biting O
the O
inside O
of O
your O
lip O
Not O
hard O
enough O
to O
actually O
hurt O
or O
leave O
a O
mark O
, O
just O
something O
to O
trick O
your O
brain O
and O
redirect O
the O
pain B-DIS
. O
And O
you O
re O
welcome O
- O
stay O
strong O
, O
friend O

Propofol B-DRUG
rules O
It O
sounds O
like O
you O
are O
having O
twilight B-DIS
sedation I-DIS
, O
which O
means O
you O
ll O
feel O
a O
mental B-DIS
blackout I-DIS
and O
later O
wake O
up O
. O
More O
or O
less O
, O
it O
is O
one O
level O
down O
from O
general O
anaesthesia O
where O
your O
body O
is O
in O
total B-DIS
paralysis I-DIS
and O
gets O
intubated O
for O
assisted O
breathing O
. O
You O
won O
t O
feel O
much O
when O
you O
wake O
up O
, O
other O
than O
slightly B-DIS
dizzy I-DIS
and I-DIS
tired I-DIS
, O
but O
urinating B-DIS
afterwards I-DIS
might I-DIS
have I-DIS
more I-DIS
of I-DIS
a I-DIS
sting I-DIS
than I-DIS
usual I-DIS
you O
can O
ask O
the O
urologist O
to O
instil O
some O
Lidocaine B-DRUG
in O
your O
bladder O
when O
they O
are O
done O
with O
the O
hydro O
before O
they O
wake O
you O
up O
. O
Some O
folks O
myself O
included O
can O
have O
extreme B-DIS
pain I-DIS
from O
complications O
, O
but O
others O
most O
, O
thankfully O
are O
as O
good O
as O
new O
after O
a O
day O
or O
so O
. O

I O
have O
no O
experience O
with O
passing B-DIS
out I-DIS
, O
and O
no O
idea O
what O
could O
be O
causing O
it O
in O
your O
case O
. O
The O
only O
tiny O
bit O
of O
knowledge O
I O
want O
to O
share O
with O
you O
is O
that O
my O
numbers O
were O
normal O
on O
T4 B-DRUG
only O
, O
and O
I O
felt B-DIS
shitty I-DIS
. O
Now O
I O
switched O
to O
T4 B-DRUG
T3 B-DRUG
and O
fell O
much O
better O
. O
If O
you O
feel O
like O
switching O
medication O
is O
something O
you O
want O
to O
try O
just O
specifically O
ask O
for O
it O
, O
probably O
your O
doctor O
won O
t O
object O
. O

How O
bad O
do O
you O
want O
a O
house O
Is O
the O
real O
question O

Ridiculously O
happy O
for O
all O
four O
of O
you O
Thank O
you O
for O
taking O
the O
time O
to O
update O
us O
and O
tell O
the O
story O
of O
that O
journey O
. O
She O
s O
a O
lucky O
lady O
and O
super O
YAY O
regarding O
the O
adoption O
. O
What O
lucky O
lil O
bits O
they O
are O
. O

So O
knowing O
your O
heart O
rate O
helps O
control O
your O
blood O
sugar O
Would O
you O
mind O
going O
into O
more O
detail O
What O
is O
Orangetheory O
I O
ve O
literally O
been O
told O
to O
not O
do O
exercise O
by O
doctors O
because O
it O
just O
makes O
my O
levels O
so O
hard O
to O
control O
and O
I O
m O
really O
struggling B-DIS
to I-DIS
stay I-DIS
fit I-DIS
without O
eating O
three O
times O
as O
much O
in O
carbs O
to O
compensate O
even O
a O
walk O
. O
It O
gets O
to O
the O
point O
where O
if O
I O
exercise O
two O
days O
in O
a O
row O
I O
m O
at O
an O
extreme O
risk O
of O
either O
super B-DIS
high I-DIS
or I-DIS
super I-DIS
low I-DIS
blood I-DIS
sugar I-DIS
the O
next O
day O
out O
of O
nowhere O
. O
Like O
I O
ll O
be O
fine O
, O
and O
suddenly O
I O
m O
not O
. O
I O
ve O
also O
had O
top O
doctors O
and O
specialists O
scratch O
their O
head O
and O
go O
I O
just O
don O
t O
know O
what O
s O
wrong O
with O
you O
. O
It O
s O
infuriating O
. O
I O
also O
get O
anxiety B-DIS
and O
am O
convinced O
it O
s O
a O
mixture O
of O
hormones O
and O
a O
really O
high B-DIS
sensitivity I-DIS
to I-DIS
any I-DIS
level I-DIS
of I-DIS
exercise I-DIS
. O
That O
is O
terrible O
you O
had O
to O
do O
that O
. O
I O
m O
in O
no O
way O
saying O
we O
aren O
t O
super O
lucky O
to O
have O
access O
to O
free O
insulin B-DRUG
, O
just O
that O
the O
quality O
of O
care O
can O
be O
pretty O
poor O
. O
Your O
situation O
sounds O
really O
rough O
, O
and O
I O
think O
the O
healthcare O
system O
in O
America O
is O
a O
complete O
joke O
. O
Will O
you O
have O
to O
go O
back O
to O
MDIs B-DRUG
have O
no O
pump O

Welcome O
Have O
not O
even O
made O
it O
a O
month O
yet O
with O
my O
diagnosis O
28 O
year O
old O
female O
, O
so O
pretty O
new O
here O
too O

Ditto O

I O
would O
offer O
you O
a O
MyTap B-DRUG
trial O
appliance O
. O
The O
MyTap O
is O
a O
custom O
boil O
and O
bite O
appliance O
that O
can O
be O
made O
in O
the O
dental O
office O
in O
an O
hour O
appointment O
. O
It O
is O
a O
device O
FDA O
approved O
for O
30 O
days O
use O
. O
It O
is O
not O
as O
comfortable O
as O
a O
device O
such O
as O
the O
Micr02 B-DRUG
and O
will O
cause O
side O
effects O
tooth B-DIS
movement I-DIS
if O
used O
for O
long O
periods O
of O
time O
. O
It O
can O
help O
identify O
if O
you O
are O
in O
the O
58-80 O
group O
of O
patients O
that O
respond O
very O
favorable O
to O
oral O
appliance O
therapy O
before O
investing O
in O
a O
device O
such O
as O
the O
Micr02 O
. O
Another O
diagnostic O
tool O
is O
the O
MATRx O
. O
It O
is O
a O
device O
used O
during O
your O
sleep O
study O
to O
help O
identify O
if O
you O
will O
respond O
well O
to O
oral O
appliance O
therapy O
. O
If O
you O
are O
identified O
with O
this O
device O
during O
your O
sleep O
study O
to O
respond O
well O
to O
oral O
appliance O
therapy O
you O
can O
have O
confidence O
in O
the O
purposed O
treatment O
. O
The O
downside O
to O
this O
device O
is O
a O
percentage O
of O
the O
people O
that O
are O
identified O
as O
non-responders O
in O
the O
sleep O
study O
go O
on O
to O
be O
successfully O
treated O
with O
an O
oral O
appliance O
. O
My O
best O
advice O
to O
anyone O
considering O
oral O
appliance O
therapy O
is O
to O
go O
to O
a O
qualified O
dentist O
. O
The O
best O
way O
to O
identify O
a O
qualified O
dentist O
is O
verifying O
they O
are O
a O
member O
of O
the O
American O
Academy O
of O
Dental O
Sleep O
Medicine O

I O
miss O
maybe O
a O
day O
per O
year O
for O
sickness B-DIS
. O
I O
hate O
ever O
taking O
any O
time O
off O
. O
I O
remember O
having O
the O
tap O
Friday O
and O
being O
laid O
up O
over O
the O
weekend O
and O
still O
not O
able O
to O
work O
until O
Wednesday O
because O
I O
couldn O
t O
sit O
up O
long O
enough O
. O
I O
went O
in O
Monday O
and O
had O
to O
lay O
down O
for O
30 O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
got O
in O
and O
I O
just O
gave O
up O
. O
I O
went O
home O
and O
had O
to O
pull O
over O
once O
to O
lay O
back O
in O
my O
seat O
and O
let O
my O
eyes O
focus O
to O
make O
it O
home O
. O
It O
was O
only O
a O
ten O
mile O
drive O
. O
I O
basically O
couldn O
t O
reliably O
be O
vertical O
for O
4 O
or O
5 O
days O
. O
So O
shitty O
. O
I O
also O
had O
an O
electric B-DIS
shock I-DIS
down I-DIS
my I-DIS
spine I-DIS
when O
I O
sat O
up O
once O
or O
twice O
, O
that O
sucked O
too O
. O
I O
hope O
I O
never O
get O
one O
again O
. O

This O
disease O
almost O
cost O
me O
my O
job O
. O
I O
was O
being O
sent O
home O
on O
regular O
occasions O
due O
to O
falling B-DIS
or O
not B-DIS
being I-DIS
able I-DIS
to I-DIS
stand I-DIS
. O
They O
understood O
my O
situation O
but O
after O
a O
while O
it O
got O
a O
but O
too O
much O
. O
Since O
taking O
the O
CBD B-DRUG
I O
ve O
been O
able O
to O
get O
back O
on O
top O
at O
work O
. O
I O
m O
back O
firing O
on O
all O
cylinders O
, O
I O
can O
concentrate O
and O
have O
the O
energy O
to O
carry O
out O
my O
duties O
. O
It O
s O
still O
there O
but O
I O
would O
have O
to O
say O
at O
most O
I O
m O
experiencing O
a O
fraction O
which O
I O
m O
more O
than O
happy O
to O
cope O
with O
. O
I O
hope O
it O
serves O
you O
well O
. O
Let O
me O
know O
how O
you O
get O
on O
it O
be O
interesting O

It O
s O
a O
progressive O
disease O
so O
what O
it O
took O
to O
fix O
it O
last O
time O
might O
not O
be O
enough O
to O
fix O
it O
this O
time O
. O
Your O
thyroid B-DIS
is O
likely O
not O
as O
capable O
as O
it O
was O
5 O
years O
ago O
. O
Eventually O
you O
ll O
be O
stable O
once O
your O
thryoid O
is O
effectively O
dead O
. O
You O
re O
nearing O
a O
full O
replacement O
dose O
for O
your O
weight O
but O
you O
re O
not O
quite O
there O
yet O
I O
don O
t O
think O
. O
Talk O
to O
your O
endo O
. O
I O
m O
165lbs O
about O
6 O
ft O
and O
on O
150mcg O
boosted O
from O
125mcg O
just O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O
and O
feel O
better O
. O
Males O
my O
weight O
can O
need O
up O
to O
200mcg O
to O
feel O
normal O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
endos O
aim O
for O
a O
TSH O
of O
1.0 O
but O
that O
doesn O
t O
work O
for O
everyone O
. O
Basically O
no O
, O
150mcg O
isn O
t O
necessarily O
too O
much O
, O
especially O
for O
a O
guy O
. O

You O
can O
start O
it O
right O
away O
. O
You O
take O
a O
half O
dose O
120mg O
twice O
a O
day O
for O
seven O
days O
, O
and O
then O
move O
onto O
the O
full O
240mg O
dose O
. O
Biogen B-DRUG
also O
has O
a O
quick O
start O
program O
for O
Tec B-DRUG
where O
you O
can O
get O
two O
weeks O
of O
medication O
shipped O
to O
your O
house O
while O
you O
re O
figuring O
out O
the O
setup O
for O
regular O
shipments O
dealing O
with O
insurance O
. O
Hope O
this O
helps O

Don O
t O
put O
all O
your O
money O
into O
it O
until O
you O
know O
100 O
what O
the O
treatment O
is O
. O
Stem O
cell O
treatment O
for O
ibs B-DIS
sounds O
odd O

Thanks O
for O
sharing O
. O
Your O
history O
is O
pretty O
similar O
to O
mine O
, O
I O
also O
ended O
up O
diagnosing O
myself O
after O
a O
year O
with O
several O
ENTs O
. O
In O
my O
case O
, O
I O
started O
with O
the O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
and O
ear B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
. O
I O
had O
a O
couple O
of O
months O
with O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
and O
then O
I O
would O
be O
ok O
for O
weeks O
. O
After O
some O
time O
, O
I O
could B-DIS
not I-DIS
recover I-DIS
my I-DIS
hearing I-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
left I-DIS
ear I-DIS
. O
Vertigo B-DIS
was O
the O
last O
symptom O
for O
me O
, O
and O
even O
when O
I O
told O
my O
ENT O
about O
my O
first O
vertigo B-DIS
attack I-DIS
, O
he O
told O
me O
it O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
my O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
. O
Then O
I O
decided O
to O
change O
doctors O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
am O
in O
betahistamin B-DRUG
and O
I O
haven O
t O
had O
a O
mayor O
vertigo B-DIS
attack O
in O
the O
last O
year O
, O
only O
small O
ones O
. O
My O
sense B-DIS
of I-DIS
balance I-DIS
is I-DIS
permanently I-DIS
damaged I-DIS
though O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
get O
better O
. O
Just O
know O
we O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
going O
through O
. O

I O
dont O
know O
why O
no O
one O
says O
this O
stuff O
causes O
cancer B-DIS
... O
one O
day O
I O
casually O
found O
out O
it O
was O
a O
group O
1 O
carcinogens O
with O
concentration O
of O
more O
then O
5 O
and O
I O
m O
thinking O
oh O
I O
probly O
have O
the O
1 O
one O
Only O
to O
discover O
I O
ve O
been O
using O
the O
10 O
concentration O
one O
and O
putting O
myself O
at O
risk O
for O
years O
. O
The O
derm O
, O
the O
pharmacist O
, O
the O
label O
... O
no O
one O
even O
gave O
me O
a O
hint O
of O
a O
warning O
on O
the O
risk O
... O
and O
same O
thing O
here O
in O
the O
comments O
. O
Yes O
sometimes O
cancer O
risks O
can O
be O
worth O
it O
but O
for O
the O
little O
effect O
it O
does O
this O
one O
should O
be O
left O
on O
the O
store O
s O
shelfs.. O

Maybe O
, O
not O
sure O
if O
that O
s O
what O
migraines B-DIS
feel O
like O
. O
I O
m O
currently O
going O
on O
hour O
78 O
of O
the O
current O
one O
and O
it O
sucks O
a O
good O
bit O
lol O
. O

I O
don O
t O
know O
about O
others O
, O
but O
mine O
has O
definitely O
decreased O
in O
severity O
somewhat O
. O
And O
I O
ve O
heard O
of O
others O
on O
this O
sub O
describing O
flares B-DIS
. O
So O
your O
symptoms O
might O
not O
always O
be O
the O
same O
level O
. O
Although O
if O
yours O
*is* O
due O
to O
Vagus B-DIS
nerve I-DIS
damage I-DIS
, O
it O
may O
not O
ever O
improve O
, O
as O
nerve B-DIS
damage I-DIS
is O
usually O
permanent O
. O

As O
long O
as O
I O
stick O
to O
a O
very O
restricted O
diet O
I O
don O
t O
vomit B-DIS
fingers O
crossed O
it O
doesn O
t O
get O
worse O
. O
But O
nausea B-DIS
, O
that O
s O
another O
issue O
. O
Nausea B-DIS
happens O
regardless O
of O
what O
I O
try O
or O
what O
I O
do O
. O
So O
you O
might O
just O
be O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
as O
me O
. O
Either O
way O
GP B-DIS
will O
still O
cause O
malnutrition B-DIS
, O
weight B-DIS
loss I-DIS
, O
and O
other O
issues O
. O
So O
definitely O
do O
all O
the O
tests O
and O
get O
all O
the O
facts O
. O
I O
also O
have O
emetophobia B-DIS
, O
so O
maybe O
you O
re O
right O
. O

Here O
s O
the O
trick O
to O
dealing O
with O
injections O
. O
You O
have O
to O
remember O
that O
your O
body O
has O
no O
actual O
pain O
memory O
. O
You O
have O
the O
split O
second O
of O
needle O
entry O
and O
that O
s O
it O
. O
All O
of O
the O
rest O
of O
it O
is O
the O
fear O
that O
you O
build O
up O
of O
it O
in O
your O
mind O
. O
If O
you O
treat O
it O
like O
it O
s O
just O
a O
thing O
it O
becomes O
just O
a O
thing O
. O

That O
is O
in O
there O
, O
many O
times O
over O
I O
empathize O
with O
you O
completely O
. O
I O
am O
an O
introvert O
by O
nature O
and O
the O
symptoms O
and O
anxiety B-DIS
that O
come O
with O
GP B-DIS
basically O
ground O
my O
social O
life O
to O
a O
halt O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
it O
s O
probably O
the O
thing O
that O
I O
struggle O
with O
the O
most O
now O
, O
15 O
years O
in O
, O
even O
though O
I O
ve O
gotten O
a O
much O
better O
handle O
on O
things O
. O
There O
s O
definitely O
no O
one-fix-for-all O
, O
but O
I O
do O
talk O
about O
this O
, O
as O
well O
as O
ways O
to O
try O
to O
be O
creative O
in O
solving O
these O
problems O
and O
being O
forgiving O
to O
yourself O
. O
I O
really O
hope O
that O
you O
are O
able O
to O
find O
your O
solution O
for O
getting O
your O
life O
and O
your O
happiness O
back O
. O
Thank O
you O
for O
providing O
this O
input O

Right O
... O
. O
because O
i O
was O
equating O
it O
to O
cancer B-DIS
. O
I O
actually O
don O
t O
eat O
gluten O
free O
now O
so O
it O
s O
not O
a O
personal O
pity O
party O
. O
I O
was O
expressing O
understanding O
and O
empathy O
for O
others O
who O
do O
. O
But O
enjoy O
your O
own O
pity O
party O
. O
I O
m O
sorry O
your O
life O
is O
so O
barren O
without O
apples O
and O
watermelon O
. O
How O
do O
you O
live O

I O
ve O
been O
there O
. O
I O
also O
have O
Essential B-DIS
Tremors I-DIS
, O
so O
when O
I O
got O
the O
DatScan O
results O
saying O
that O
I O
had O
both O
, O
I O
was O
crushed O
. O
I O
cried O
for O
2 O
months O
solid O
. O
It O
was O
pretty O
bleak O
. O
I O
ordered O
Parkinson O
s O
Disease O
for O
Dummies O
, O
and O
although O
it O
answered O
my O
questions O
, O
the O
outlook O
was O
still O
grim O
. O
I O
had O
a O
why O
bother O
Attitude O
about O
everything O
. O
Nothing O
had O
meaning O
anymore O
. O
Finish O
my O
degree O
For O
what O
Take O
my O
meds O
Why O
I O
m O
still O
sick O
. O
I O
m O
going O
to O
suffer O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
. O
Then O
, O
I O
remembered O
a O
segment O
on O
CBS O
Sunday O
morning O
about O
Rock O
Steady O
Boxing O
. O
I O
forced O
myself O
to O
go O
. O
Gym O
, O
shower O
, O
bed O
. O
That O
was O
my O
life O
. O
Nothing O
else O
for O
at O
least O
2 O
months O
. O
Slowly O
more O
life O
creeped O
in O
. O
Lunches O
with O
friends O
. O
Movies O
by O
myself O
. O
Support O
group O
meetings O
. O
It O
s O
been O
6 O
months O
now O
. O
I O
m O
still O
terrified O
of O
what O
s O
going O
to O
happen O
. O
But O
in O
the O
meantime O
, O
I O
can O
have O
a O
few O
good O
, O
almost O
symptom O
free O
days O
. O
I O
have O
to O
appreciate O
the O
now O
, O
and O
not O
obsess O
with O
what O
may O
probably O
will O
happen O
to O
me O
in O
the O
future O
. O

My O
dad O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
Parkinson O
s O
in O
his O
50s O
. O
The O
Rock O
Your O
Retirement O
show O
had O
a O
guest O
named O
Vikki O
Claflin O
. O
She O
has O
Parkinson O
s O
but O
she O
is O
keeping O
her O
sense O
of O
humor O
about O
it O
. O
If O
you O
want O
to O
hear O
the O
episode O
where O
she O
talks O
about O
it O
, O
you O
can O
go O
to O

I O
would O
try O
posting O
in O
the O
chronic B-DIS
pain I-DIS
sub O
to O
hit O
a O
wider O
audience O
. O
Sorry O
I O
don O
t O
know O
much O
about O
it O
. O
I O
only O
know O
that O
it O
s O
not O
uncommon O
for O
people O
to O
apply O
several O
times O
before O
getting O
approved O
. O
Maybe O
look O
into O
getting O
a O
lawyer O
if O
your O
parents O
can O
help O
you O
with O
the O
cost O
. O
Good O
luck O

DA O
s O
can O
cause O
issues O
. O
Typically O
the O
gold O
standard O
is O
starting O
a O
patient O
with O
3 O
times O
a O
day O
25-100 O
Sinmet B-DRUG
tritrate O
over O
four O
weeks O
to O
see O
if O
they O
respond O
. O
Once O
PD B-DIS
is O
confirmed O
responded O
to O
Sinmet B-DRUG
then O
looking O
at O
other O
drugs O
. O
How O
old O
is O
the O
person O
Decades O
of O
marriage O
means O
they O
could O
be O
in O
their O
50 O
s O
or O

Can O
t O
help O
you O
with O
the O
NJ B-DIS
. O
I O
just O
had O
a O
straight O
J B-DIS
. O
The O
feeding B-DIS
tube I-DIS
helped O
me O
a O
lot O
until O
I O
could O
begin O
to O
eat O
. O
I O
had O
a O
pyloroplasty B-DIS
done O
last O
June O
which O
opens O
up O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
stomach O
. O
It O
still O
took O
me O
almost O
a O
year O
to O
be O
able O
to O
eat O
again O
. O
They O
were O
going O
to O
try O
the O
balloon O
to O
further O
dilate B-DIS
the I-DIS
bottom I-DIS
of I-DIS
my I-DIS
stomach I-DIS
. O
However O
, O
I O
got O
well O
enough O
before O
we O
needed O
to O
do O
that O
. O
My O
doctor O
said O
it O
s O
exactly O
like O
an O
endoscopy B-DIS
so O
there O
is O
no O
extra O
pain O
or O
anything O
. O

Yeah O
I O
was O
researching O
earlier O
and O
it O
seemed O
that O
a O
problem O
in O
just O
one O
area O
of O
the O
region O
can O
cause O
effects O
everywhere O
else O
especially O
if O
it O
has O
to O
do O
with O
pelvic B-DIS
floor I-DIS
issues I-DIS
... O
I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
have O
PGAD B-DIS
specifically O
though O
just O
because O
as O
I O
ve O
researched O
it O
people O
with O
it O
seem O
to O
have O
a O
near O
orgasm O
feeling O
, O
which O
isn O
t O
what O
I O
have O
. O
My O
discomfort B-DIS
I O
usually O
can O
just O
forget O
about O
if O
I O
m O
distracted O
with O
something O
else O
. O

It O
s O
understandable O
that O
this O
would O
be O
your O
disposition O
. O
It O
would O
not O
, O
however O
, O
be O
my O
mothers O
. O
Even O
now O
, O
she O
has O
retained O
her O
appreciation O
for O
art O
. O
Although O
she O
does O
not O
have O
the O
cognition O
to O
express O
her O
opinion O
on O
the O
matter O
now O
, O
I O
m O
certain O
that O
she O
would O
have O
an O
appreciation O
for O
this O
picture O
. O
A O
lifelong O
existential O
nihilist O
, O
she O
recognized O
that O
millions O
of O
people O
could O
look O
at O
this O
picture O
and O
it O
is O
overwhelmingly O
likely O
that O
not O
a O
single O
one O
of O
them O
will O
have O
even O
glancingly O
encountered O
her O
in O
their O
entire O
lives O
. O
On O
that O
basis O
, O
she O
would O
not O
care O
; O
it O
is O
not O
her O
legacy O
or O
memory O
. O
More O
importantly O
, O
we O
are O
talking O
about O
a O
woman O
that O
wanted O
to O
document O
photograph O
her O
aunt O
s O
decline O
from O
Alzheimers B-DIS
, O
with O
the O
primary O
justification O
of O
artistic O
license O
. O
If O
this O
photo O
has O
managed O
to O
affect O
one O
person O
, O
however O
fleetingly O
, O
I O
m O
certain O
that O
she O
would O
have O
felt O
positively O
about O
it O
. O
Perhaps O
it O
does O
capture O
the O
helplessness O
and O
desperation O
of O
the O
photographer O
- O
but O
I O
am O
not O
helpless O
before O
my O
camera O
. O
Alzheimers B-DIS
is O
a O
hopeless O
and O
tragic O
disease O
. O
I O
feel O
helpless O
because O
I O
can O
not O
truly O
help O
my O
mother O
. O
I O
can O
only O
care O
for O
her O
as O
she O
continually B-DIS
declines I-DIS
. O
She O
has O
a O
terminal B-DIS
illness I-DIS
, O
for O
which O
there O
is O
no O
treatment O
- O
let O
alone O
cure O
; O
without O
affording O
you O
the O
dignity O
of O
taking O
your O
body O
before O
your O
mind O
, O
it O
slowly O
steals O
everything O
that O
comprises O
you O
, O
before O
it O
finally O
kills O
you O
. O
I O
am O
desperate O
- O
but O
I O
am O
not O
desperate O
for O
whatever O
distasteful O
reasoning O
you O
withheld O
from O
your O
speculation O
. O

Never O
heard O
of O
it O
for O
that O
reason O
. O
Also O
it O
doesn O
t O
make O
sense O
in O
my O
case O
. O
I O
got O
very O
use O
to O
my O
symptoms O
, O
slept O
great O
, O
low B-DIS
stress I-DIS
and O
still O
had O
brain B-DIS
fog I-DIS
. O
Not O
to O
mention O
in O
times O
with O
no O
symptoms O
that O
I O
am O
stressed B-DIS
and O
have O
low B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
I O
do O
not O
have O
brain O
fog O
. O
Everyone O
is O
different O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
a O
24-hour O

collection O

I O
have O
been O
on O
medication O
for O
a O
week O
now O
and O
I O
am O
starting O
to O
feel O
a O
little O
better O
. O
I O
still O
have O
the O
pains B-DIS
but O
otherwise O
I O
feel O
better O

I O
have O
hypothyroidism B-DIS
, O
but O
so O
do O
my O
grandmother O
and O
my O

, O
so O
it O
wasn O

unexpected O

I O
ve O
always O
had O
mine O

it O
was O
fine O

weeks O
from O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
to O
the O
POTS B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
, O
including O
waiting O
a O
week O
to O
get O
an O
appointment O
with O
the O
specialist O
I O
was O
referred O
to O
. O
I O
was O
INCREDIBLY O
lucky O
. O
I O
was O
seeing O
my O
neurologist O
every O
3 O
weeks O
because O
of O
medication O
changes O
, O
and O
he O
always O
took O
my O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
standing O
up O
and O
sitting O
down O
. O
I O
was O
so O
out O
of O
it O
because O
of O
the O
switch O
that O
I O
barely O
remember O
what O
he O
said O
about O
it O
. O
I O
had O
never O
heard O
of O
anything O
similar O
to O
it O
and O
just O
waltzed O
along O
, O
got O
a O
24 O
hour O
heart O
monitor O
, O
and O
bang O
. O
I O
have O
no O
idea O
how O
I O
got O
so O
lucky O
. O
At O
all O
. O

Couldn O
t O
agree O
more O
Diet O
has O
so O
much O
to O
do O
with O
it O
. O
Do O
your O
research O
on O
all O
types O
of O
treatment O
, O
and O
come O
to O
your O
own O
conclusion O
on O
how O
to O
move O
forward O
. O
Don O
t O
let O
anyone O
tell O
you O
diet O
isn O
t O
going O
to O
help O
or O
work O
, O
until O
you O
try O
it O
for O
yourself O
. O
I O
ve O
found O
people O
on O
the O
sub O
are O
not O
to O
keen O
on O
the O
diet O
approach O
, O
because O
it O
typically O
takes O
longer O
to O
heal O
and O
it O
s O
hard O
. O
But O
all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
I O
ve O
had O
plaque B-DIS
and I-DIS
guttate I-DIS
psoriasis I-DIS
for O
about O
10 O
years O
now O
, O
I O
ve O
tried O
almost O
ever O
cream B-DRUG
, O
lotion B-DRUG
, O
treatment O
given O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
that O
has O
worked O
for O
me O
is O
UV O
treatment O
and O
diet O
. O
Over O
the O
summer O
I O
had O
a O
flare B-DIS
that O
covered O
80 O
of O
my O
body O
, O
healed O
it O
through O
diet O
. O
So O
just O
do O
your O
research O
on O
medications O
, O
and O
alternative O
treatments O
and O
make O
the O
best O
decision O
based O
on O
that O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
asking O
. O
I O
haven O
t O
too O
much O
, O
but O
in O
the O
meantime O
my O
Sertraline B-DRUG
has O
been O
increased O
from O
50mg O
to O
100mg O
which O
could O
help O
with O
anxiety B-DIS
. O
The O
ultrasound O
will O
hopefully O
be O
done O
either O
next O
week O
or O
the O
week O
after O
, O
once O
the O
GP O
has O
seen O
the O
results O
, O
hopefully O
he O
will O
refer O
me O
to O
the O
urologist O
quickly O
after O
, O
I O
have O
to O
get O
through O
a O
lot O
of O
medical O
bureaucracy O
. O
P O

The O
neuro O
opthalmologist O
said O
to O
me O
recently O
that O
a O
very O
mild O
ON B-DIS
sign O
is O
red B-DIS
desaturation I-DIS
, O
which O
I O
m O
sure O
you O
could O
easily O
miss O
. O
So O
, O
maybe O

And O
since O
I O
know O
you O
like O
science O
, O
there O
s O
a O
proposed O
mechanism O
of O
action O
now O
too O
That O
s O
a O
news O
amp O
; O
views O
, O
but O
it O
links O
to O
the O
original O
findings O

I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
am O
ready O
for O
that O
jelly O
. O

Just O
hoping O
the O
weather O
holds O
. O
Finally O
finishing O
up O
some O
cubbies O
for O
our O
Rock O
Steady O
Boxing O
class O
. O
Slower O
progress O
than O
hoped O
, O
but O
feels O
good O
to O
keep O
making O
progress O
. O
random O
progress O
Next O
wood O
working O
project O
flow O
chart O
will O
be O
Cut O
panels O
Trial O
fit O
everything O
sand O
everything O
both O
side O
tape O
edges O
to O
be O
glued O
stain O
while O
I O
can O
everything O
as O
single O
parts O
remove O
tape O
from O
glued O
edge O
place O
tape O
around O
finished O

capture O

glue O
up O
one O

at O
time O
when O
possible O
remove O

before O

clear O
polycoat O
last O
thing O
or O
should O
I O
do O
that O
after O

, O
before O

Mine O
was O
2 O
months O
ago O
, O
and O
it O
scared O
the O
crap O
out O
of O
me O
going O
in O
. O
But O
the O
anesth B-DRUG
was O
super O
nice O
and O
comforting O
, O
and O
it O
was O
done O
before O
I O
realized O
. O
Just O
make O
sure O
you O
rest O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
days O
after O
, O
and O
drink O
lots O
of O
fluid O
. O
Good O
luck O

Hell O
yeah O

I O
have O
been O
dizzy B-DIS
for O
the O
last O
year O
. O
Like O
almost O
everyday O
, O
24 O
7. O
thats O
feeling O
helpless O
because O
nothing O
works O
. O
seriously O
, O
well O
we O
are O
trying O
a O
shots O
of O
steroid B-DRUG
in O
the O
ear O
. O
and O
I O
am O
just O
trying O
get O
over O
this O
shock O
because O
it O
just O
all O
hit O
home O
. O
I O
am O
processing O
. O
and O
stuffs O
. O
I O
knew O
it O
was O
coming O
but O
still O
. O

Never O
scratch O
or O
scrape O
anything O
off O
. O
By O
doing O
that O
, O
you O
will O
be O
slowly O
extending O
the O
boundaries O
of O
the O
lesions B-DIS
. O
There O
are O
many O
ways O
to O
manage O
it O
. O
To O
start O
off O
, O
rather O
than O
the O
scraping O
nonsense O
, O
get O
a O
keratolytic B-DRUG
skin O
tissue O
softener O
. O
Urea B-DRUG
, O
a O
chemical O
that O
is O
naturally O
present O
in O
sweat O
, O
is O
amazing O
, O
and O
also O
acts O
as O
a O
moisturizer O
. O
I O
like O
Excipial O
20 O
urea O
No O
need O
to O
go O
stronger O
. O
This O
will O
soften O
the O
plaques B-DIS
and O
make O
them O
slough O
off O
naturally O
. O
Use O
several O
times O
a O
day O
and O
don O
t O
rinse O
it O
off O
. O
The O
itching B-DIS
, O
apparently O
, O
mostly O
comes O
from O
the O
skin O
suffocating O
under O
the O
many O
layers O
of O
dead O
skin O
cells O
. O
The O
main O
symptom O
of O
psoriasis B-DIS
is O
rapid B-DIS
skin I-DIS
growth I-DIS
, O
caused O
by O
inflammation B-DIS
; O
the O
skin O
produces O
new O
skin O
faster O
than O
it O
s O
able O
to O
shed O
the O
upper O
horny O
layer O
stratum O
corneum O
. O
This O
build-up O
is O
referred O
to O
as O
plaques O
. O
The O
dry O
, O
flaky O
stuff O
is O
just O
dead O
keratin O
. O
What O
you O
want O
to O
do O
is O
not O
just O
get O
rid O
of O
the O
dead O
skin O
cells O
, O
but O
also O
reduce O
the O
underlying O
inflammation O
and O
inhibit O
the O
rate O
of O
skin O
growth O
. O
To O
do O
this O
, O
there O
are O
multiple O
different O
treatments O
which O
can O
be O
done O
concurrently O
* O
Topical B-DRUG
steroids I-DRUG
. O
These O
go O
from O
very O
potent O
to O
mild O
. O
Usually O
you O
ll O
use O
a O
potent O
steroid O
to O
get O
down O
to O
smooth O
skin O
, O
then O
a O
milder O
steroid O
to O
maintain O
that O
state O
. O
Steroids O
need O
to O
be O
cycled O
on O
off O
to O
avoid O
long-term O
damage O
to O
the O
skin O
. O
* O
Vitamin O
D3 O
calcipotriene O
calcipotriol B-DRUG
. O
This O
can O
be O
used O
every O
day O
, O
and O
is O
not O
harmful O
. O
Its O
effect O
is O
weaker O
than O
steroids O
, O
and O
needs O
4-8 O
weeks O
to O
reach O
optimal O

effect O
. O
* O
UVB O
light O
. O
Effective O
for O
most O
people O
, O
but O
there O
s O
only O
a O
limited O
amount O
you O
can O
do O
per O
year O
. O
You O
can O
also O
get O
good O
effect O
from O
just O
sunlight O
. O
* O
Coal O
tar O
OTC O
or O
prescription O
works O
well O
for O
many O
people O
. O
It O
slows O
down O
skin O
cell O
activity O
. O
Lastly O
, O
see O
a O
dermatologist O
. O

I O
had O
some O
Prednisone B-DRUG
tablets I-DRUG
for O
a O
few O
weeks O
after O
having O
seen O
the O
ENT O
in O
February O
and O
it O
didn O
t O
seem O
to O
make O
any O
difference O
. O
My O
hearing B-DIS
seemed I-DIS
to I-DIS
fluctuate I-DIS
till O
around O
mid O
April O
, O
then O
I O
started O
Betahistine B-DRUG
and O
a O
low O
salt O
diet O
, O
and O
for O
2 O
weeks O
it O
seemed O
to O
go O
away O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
d O
solved O
the O
issue O
. O
However O
this O
week O
has O
been O
a O
nightmare O
, O
nearly O
everyday O
with O
tinnitus B-DIS
much O
much O
louder O
and O
hearing B-DIS
severely I-DIS
reduced I-DIS
. O
My O
ENT O
said O
it O
was O
due O
to O
swelling B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
ear I-DIS
and O
the O
diet O
and O
tablets O
would O
help O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
searching O
for O
a O
trigger O
for O
it O
but O
it O
seems O
completely O
random O
. O
Good O
to O
know O
I O
m O
not O
alone O
with O
this O
I O
couldn O
t O
find O
any O
information O
on O
it O
anywhere O
Do O
you O
have O
a O
hearing O
aid O
for O
when O
it O
is O
bad O

TIL O
That O
was O
very O
informative O

My O
fourth O
go-round O
with O
the O
internal O
Botox B-DRUG
injections O
was O
this O
morning O
. O
So O
right O
now O
I O
m O
firmly O
in O
the O
pissing O
razor O
blades O
phase O
because O
scope O
and O
needles O
... O
. O
but O
I O
have O
me O
some O
oxy B-DRUG
and O
I O
m O
looking O
forward O
to O
the O
glorious O
weeks O
months O
in O
which O
urination B-DIS
or O
the O
lack O
of O
it O
does O
not O
rule O
my O
life O
. O
The O
first O
time O
I O
had O
this O
done O
, O
it O
was O
like O
frickin O
magic O
. O
The O
second O
time O
, O
not O
so O
much O
. O
The O
third O
was O
pretty O
good O
, O
but O
not O
quite O
the O
magic O
of O
the O
first O
. O
Cross O
your O
fingers O
for O
me O
about O
this O
time O
. O

Sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
. O
It O
s O
quite O
a O
harsh O
thing O
to O
stomach O
, O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
about O
six O
month O
ago O
, O
too O
. O
It O
took O
a O
little O
bit O
of O
time O
for O
me O
to O
realize O
, O
that O
life O
won O
t O
stop O
just O
because O
I O
can O
t O
get O
my O
head O
around O
the O
idea O
, O
that O
I O
will O
have O
this O
sickness O
for O
the O
rest O
of O
my O
life O
. O
But O
you O
know O
, O
eventually O
you O
will O
bite O
the O
bullet O
and O
go O
on O
. O
IMO O
, O
it O
s O
absolutely O
normal O
that O
you O
actively O
want O
to O
do O
something O
about O
it O
and O
not O
just O
rely O
on O
doctors O
and O
medication O
- O
but O
it O
s O
extremely O
hard O
to O
recommend O
s.th O
. O
for O
each O
and O
everyone O
of O
us O
, O
because O
it O
s O
such O
a O
diverse O
disease O
. O
For O
me O
, O
I O
radically O
changed O
my O
diet O
no O
more O
animal O
fat O
, O
as O
little O
fat O
as O
possible O
, O
stopped O
drinking O
alcohol O
and O
started O
with O
regular O
fitness O
training O
lang O
walks O
and O
things O
like O
that O
. O
I O
feel O
great O
since O
I O
did O
. O
Whether O
or O
not O
it O
will O
change O
the O
course O
of O
the O
MS B-DIS
itself O
I O
can O
t O
tell O
. O
I O
read O
much O
about O
the O
Swank O
Diet O
and O
it O
s O
benefits O
for O
many O
MS-patients B-DIS
- O
but O
it O
seems O
like O
something O
you O
have O
to O
believe O
in O
, O
to O
make O
it O
work O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
would O
strongly O
recommend O
, O
is O
to O
start O
with O
a O
medical O
treatment O
. O
I O
live O
in O
germany O
and O
have O
the O
great O
benefit O
of O
a O
functioning O
health O
care O
system O
, O
so O
I O
don O
t O
have O
to O
pay O
the O
extreme O
medical-bills O
by O
myself O
. O
I O
can O
t O
help O
but O
wonder O
how O
you O
Americans O
do O
it O
... O

A1c B-DIS
is O
a O
good O
indication O
of O
your O
bg O
control O
over O
the O
previous O
few O
months O
. O
So O
the O
rise O
is O
showing O
that O
your O
bg O
control O
is O
not O
as O
good O
as O
the O
months O
leading O
up O
to O
your O
previous O
one O
, O
and O
that O
all O
comes O
down O
to O
carbs O
in O
your O
diet O
. O

We O
ve O
had O
people O
in O
the O
sub O
with O
TSHs B-DIS
in I-DIS
the I-DIS
triple I-DIS
digits I-DIS
... O
that O
being O
said O
, O
my O
last O
tests O
came O
in O
about O
the O
same O
and O
I O
ve O
felt B-DIS
HORRID I-DIS
. O
My O
healthy O
TSH O
was O
.05 O
ish O
pre-op O
and O
about O
1 O
post-op O
. O
Everyone O
is O
different O
. O
A O
TSH O
of O
5 O
for O
me O
means O
depression B-DIS
, O
paranoia B-DIS
, O
severe B-DIS
aches I-DIS
and I-DIS
pains I-DIS
, O
pure B-DIS
exhaustion I-DIS
, O
and O
bad B-DIS
brain I-DIS
fog I-DIS
. O
Your O
TSH O
is O
certainly O
in O
the O
range O
where O
a O
doctor O
may O
want O
to O
start O
putting O
you O
on O
meds O
and O
see O
how O
you O
feel O
. O
Remember O
to O
listen O
to O
your O
body O
, O
not O
your O
numbers O
. O

I O
am O
very O
happy O
your O
girlfriend O
has O
found O
something O
that O
helps O
her O
But O
for O
anyone O
who O
s O
thinking O
of O
doing O
this O
- O
please O
give O
it O
a O
try O
, O
but O
please O
please O
please O
don O
t O
stop O
your O
medications O
. O
If O
you O
find O
you O
feel O
better O
, O
talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
about O
slowly O
tapering O
off O
of O
them O
if O
that O
s O
the O
direction O
you O
want O
to O
go O
in O
. O
I O
thought O
I O
had O
improved O
on O
a O
similar O
diet O
and O
was O
symptom O
free O
for O
almost O
6 O
months O
without O
medication O
, O
but O
it O
came O
back O
with O
a O
vengeance O
. O
There O
s O
a O
reason O
for O
the O
medicine O
- O
if O
the O
majority O
could O
be O
cured O
through O
lifestyle O
changes O
they O
would O
be O
. O

hey O
i O
also O
suffer O
from O
vertigo B-DIS
attacks I-DIS
lasting O
hours O
, O
can O
you O
recommend O
an O
ent O
in O
houston O
i O
see O
you O
live O
here O
as O
well O
. O
thank O
you O

It O
relates O
to O
what O
I O
avoid O
as O
trigger O
foods O
and O
has O
some O
great O
recipes O
. O
I O
recommend O
it O
to O
anyone O
who O
avoids O
trigger O
foods O
. O
Thanks O

Thanks O
for O
the O
help O
He O
s O
recently O
started O
riding O
the O
bike O
at O
the O
gym O
. O
He O
s O
a O
bit O
overweight B-DIS
so O
I O
hope O
he O
starts O
to O
take O
exercising O
seriously O
. O
I O
will O
take O
a O
look O
at O
the O
foundation O

Understood O
completely O
. O
I O
have O
tried O
to O
do O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
research O
on O
apnea B-DIS
and O
she O
fits O
a O
bunch O
of O
the O
symptoms O
but O
she O
doesn O
t O
stop B-DIS
breathing I-DIS
every O
night O
. O
I O
will O
start O
looking O
into O
the O
snoring B-DIS
symptoms O
and O
see O
what O
we O
can O
do O
with O
those O
. O
Is O
there O
such O
thing O
as O
intermittent B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
As O
that O
is O
what O
i O
would O
have O
to O
describe O
what O
she O
does O
. O
The O
first O
night O
she O
had O
the O
home O
machine O
on O
she O
slept O
so O
peaceful O
and O
never O
stopped O
breathing O
. O
The O
night O
after O
was O
horrible O
enough O
for O
me O
to O
put O
the O
machine O
back O
on O
her O
even O
though O
it O
was O
supposed O
to O
be O
for O
one O
night O
only O
use O
. O
Makes O
it O
hard O
to O
sleep O
for O
me O
as O
well O
when O
i O
want O
to O
stay O
awake O
to O
make O
sure O
she O
starts O
breathing O
again O
. O

The O
first O
time O
I O
noticed O
vertigo B-DIS
was O
waking O
up O
one O
night O
with O
it O
. O
I O
would O
recommend O
seeing O
an O
ent O
. O
You O
may O
need O
a O
referral O
from O
your O
GP O
depending O
on O
your O
insurance O
. O
Tell O
them O
your O
family O
history O
of O
the O
meniere O
s O
and O
your O
symptoms O
. O
You O
will O
probably O
have O
to O
do O
a O
few O
balance O
tests O
. O
If O
you O
have O
insurance O
. O
It O
will O
be O
covered O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
where O
in O
Minnesota O
you O
are O
. O
if O
your O
close O
to O
the O
Twin O
Cities O
there O
are O
a O
ton O
of O
good O
clinics O
. O
I O
see O
a O
great O
doctor O
in O
Saint O
Paul O
and O
did O
my O
testing O
through O
the O
nstional O
dizzy O
and O
balance O
center O
. O
The O
have O
clinics O
throughout O
the O
Twin O
Cities O
. O

I O
have O
vulvodynia B-DIS
vulvar B-DIS
pain I-DIS
as O
well O
as O
IC B-DIS
. O
I O
ve O
done O
a O
bunch O
of O
different O
things O
to O
combat O
it O
. O
Cotton O
underwear O
only O
or O
none O
at O
all O
, O
baths O
in O
Instant O
Ocean O
salt O
, O
pelvic O
floor O
PT O
, O
and O
antibiotics B-DRUG
for O
ureaplasma B-DIS
treatment O
. O
The O
things O
that O
help O
the O
most O
are O
PT O
and O
antibiotics B-DRUG
. O
If O
you O
haven O
t O
been O
tested O
for O
ureaplasma B-DIS
, O
it O
might O
be O
worth O
asking O
your O
doc O
. O
The O
first O
time O
I O
was O
tested O
, O
it O
came O
back O
negative O
. O
I O
saw O
a O
new O
gyne O
and O
he O
cultured O
a O
different O
location O
which O
came O
back O
positive O
. O
I O
have O
noticed O
that O
when O
I O
have O
trigger B-DIS
points I-DIS
, O
they O
can O
refer O
itchiness B-DIS
and I-DIS
pain I-DIS
to I-DIS
other I-DIS
areas I-DIS
. O
I O
normally O
feel O
relief O
after O
my O
PT O
appointments O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
re O
able O
to O
determine O
the O
root O
of O
the O
problem O
so O
you O
can O
get O
some O
relief O
. O

I O
try O
to O
tell O
them O
my O
skin O
tries O
to O
heal O
a O
cut O
, O
even O
if O
I O
hadn O
t O
cut O
myself.. O
otherwise O
I O
just O
tell O
them O
I O
fell O
off O
my O
skateboard O
. O

You O
can O
stomach O
sleep O
I O
do O
you O
just O
have O
to O
turn O
your O
head O
to O
the O
side O
. O

Sorry O
to O
hear O
you O
family O
member O
is O
having O
problems O
I O
am O
not O
a O
Dr O
but O
just O
based O
on O
my O
experience O
with O
my O
dad O
. O
1 O
Double O
check O
the O
rytary B-DRUG
dosing O
conversion O
chart O
on O
the O
rytary B-DRUG
website O
. O
My O
dad O
wound O
up O
going O
up O
40 O
dose O
because O
of O
being O
prescribed O
wrong O
dose O
. O
It O
gave O
him O
a O
manic B-DIS
episode I-DIS
and O
hallucinations B-DIS
. O
2 O
It O
could O
be O
psychiatric B-DIS
issues I-DIS
creeping O
up O
. O
Talk O
to O
your O
neuro O
. O
Don O
t O
let O
him O
brush O
off O
your O
concerns O
. O
Best O
luck O
and O
best O
health O
to O
you O
and O
your O
family O
. O

The O
point O
is O
that O
early B-DIS
stage I-DIS
breast I-DIS
cancer I-DIS
can O
be O
caught O
with O
a O
degree O
of O
reliability O
. O
Unlike O
say O
... O
. O
pancreatic B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
. O
The O
survival O
rates O
for O
stage O
0 O
1 O
2 O
3 O
4 O
breast B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
are O
approx O
100 O
100 O
93 O
72 O
22 O
So O
. O
Regardless O
of O
the O
stage O
, O
my O
point O
was O
to O
be O
in O
a O
position O
where O
we O
can O
catch O
RA B-DIS
as O
early O
as O
we O
traditionally O
catch O
breast B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
You O
seem O
to O
have O
misread O
my O
comment O
entirely O
, O
as O
survival O
rate O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
what O
I O
said O
. O
Catching O
RA B-DIS
early O
would O
be O
brilliant O
Speaking O
from O
experience O
- O
pancreatic B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
stage O
2A O
; O
much O
worse O
survival O
rates O
than O
breast B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
- O
because O
it O
can O
t O
be O
found O
in O
time O

We O
have O
no O
trains O
around O
here O
and O
although O
it O
s O
excellent O
to O
hear O
a O
plane O
wouldn O
t O
cause O
me O
to O
have O
a O
dramatic O
embarrassing O
episode O
, O
I O
know O
any O
destinations O
after O
the O
plane O
will O
involve O
a O
lot O
of O
motion O
. O
I O
used O
to O
be O
able O
to O
take O
on O
some O
pretty O
extreme O
rides O
as O
kid O
also O
until O
one O
year O
as O
an O
older O
teen O
it O
made O
my O
head O
go O
insane O
on O
something O
pretty O
basic O
and O
I O
just O
thought O
I O
was O
losing O
my O
edge O
. O
The O
symptoms O
progressed O
slowly O
over O
the O
years.. O
to O
where O
I O
just O
thought O
I O
was O
getting O
old O
a O
little O
faster O
than O
others O
then O
hit O
me O
pretty O
hard O
out O
of O
nowhere O
with O
a O
bucket O
list O
of O
vestibular O
type O
issues O
. O
But O
besides O
the O
tinnitus B-DIS
and O
full B-DIS
ears I-DIS
I O
can O
still O
hear O
well O
... O
incredibly O
well O
... O
to O
the O
point O
it O
hurts O
well O
. O
And O
it O
seemed O
to O
progress O
and O
then O
hit O
which O
I O
ve O
heard O
doesn O
t O
happen O
with O
meniere O
s O
it O
hits O
you O
out O
of O
nowhere O
with O
no O
slow O
progression O
at O
first O
so O
I O
hope O
I O
m O
atleast O
going O
in O
the O
right O
direction O
with O
medical O
care O
. O

It O
really O
could O
be O
any O
number O
of O
things O
, O
a O
movement O
specialist O
is O
the O
way O
to O
go O
when O
you O
can O
afford O
to O
. O
Keep O
at O
it O
until O
you O
get O
solid O
results O
, O
I O
was O
under O
misdiagnosed O
for O
15 O
years O
. O
That O
s O
a O
long O
battle O
, O
without O
meds O
or O
a O
definitive O
diagnosis O
. O
Contrary O
to O
popular O
belief O
, O
there O
IS O
a O
test O
for O
Parkinson O
s O
Disease O
. O
I O
had O
a O
DaTScan O
done O
, O
because O
I O
show O
symptoms O
of O
both O
Essential B-DIS
Tremors I-DIS
and O
Parkinson O
s O
Disease O
. O
I O
ve O
got O
both O
, O
early O
onset O
for O
the O
neurological O
hat O
trick O
I O
couldn O
t O
feed O
myself O
2 O
years O
ago O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
m O
on O
the O
proper O
meds O
and O
working O
out O
3 O
times O
a O
week O
, O
high O
intensity O
. O
I O
finally O
feel O
good O
. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
atypical O
to O
have O
the O
vertigo B-DIS
symptoms O
worsen O
after O
ten O
years O
, O
mostly O
Meniere B-DIS
sufferers O
have O
their O
worst O
bouts O
of O
dizziness B-DIS
in O
the O
first O
months O
after O
the O
onset O
. O
This O
is O
not O
worrying O
in O
itself O
, O
you O
can O
just O
have O
some O
atypical O
symptoms O
or O
another O
cause O
can O
be O
in O
play O
. O
Anyway O
, O
visiting O
a O
ENT O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
good O
idea O
. O
Unfortunately O
it O
took O
me O
over O
25 O
years O
to O
get O
the O
right O
diagnosis O
always O
being O
told O
I O
had O
Menieres O
, O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
Ramsay B-DIS
Hunt I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
- O
not O
that O
it O
makes O
much O
difference O
for O
everyday O
life O
. O
My O
point O
being O
, O
there O
is O
not O
much O
in O
the O
doctor O
s O
toolbox O
to O
fix O
dizziness B-DIS
, O
but O
you O
should O
be O
able O
to O
get O
a O
diagnosis O
. O

Clobetasol B-DRUG
helped O
me O
. O

Are O
you O
currently O
on O
any O
medications O

Every O
time O
I O
get O
a O
flu B-DIS
shot I-DRUG
, O
I O
m O
down O
for O
2 O
weeks O
sick B-DIS
. O
Every O
time O
I O
don O
t O
get O
the O
flu B-DRUG
shot I-DRUG
, O
I O
never O
get O
the O
flu O
. O
Regardless O
of O
what O
people O
tell O
me O
, O
I O
know O
my O
own O
body O
and O
its O
reactions O
. O
Having O
RA B-DIS
will O
suppress B-DIS
your I-DIS
immune I-DIS
system I-DIS
badly I-DIS
, O
so O
if O
you O
think O
the O
shots B-DRUG
will O
help O
, O
go O
ahead O
and O
get O
them O
, O
as O
I O
m O
just O
speaking O
from O
my O
own O
personal O
experience O
. O

Ok O
, O
so O
keeping O
the O
body O
cool O
is O
mandatory O
, O
got O
it O
, O
thank O
you O

Yeah O
I O
try O
not O
to O
ask O
a O
million O
questions O
to O
her O
because O
I O
know O
she O
already O
has O
enough O
on O
her O
plate O
. O
To O
your O
situation O
she O
went O
through O
the O
same O
scenario O
. O
Went O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O
Was O
on O
a O
steroid B-DRUG
for O
five O
days O
. O
Then O
was O
released O
only O
to O
relapse O
again O
and O
thats O
when O
her O
sight B-DIS
got I-DIS
worse I-DIS
. O
They O
didnt O
get O
her O
into O
the O
clinic O
for O
five O
weeks O
and O
in O
the O
span O
of O
three O
weeks O
of O
going O
to O
said O
clinic O
where O
she O
has O
had O
to O
fight O
the O
insurance O
company O
for O
medicine O
and O
short O
term O
disability O
. O
So O
I O
know O
exactly O
where O
you O
come O
from O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
the O
that O
whole O
thing O
. O
Well O
at O
least O
the O
outsider O
looking O
in O
. O
I O
dont O
expect O
her O
to O
be O
treated O
special O
because O
everyone O
has O
had O
worse O
cases O
and O
what O
not O
. O
I O
just O
wish O
these O
steroids B-DRUG
would O
help O
. O
They O
dont O
seem O
to O
be O
doing O
much O
. O
When O
she O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
they O
actually O
worked O
but O
now O
not O
so O
much O
. O
Ill O
look O
into O
that O
book O
for O
her O
Maybe O
Ill O
see O
if O
their O
is O
an O
audiobook O
haha O
. O
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
response O
though O
. O
Its O
crazy O
that O
all O
this O
can O
happen O
in O
such O
a O
short O
period O
of O
time O
. O
It O
seems O
surreal O
honestly O
but O
I O
wish O
you O
luck O
to O
you O
as O
well O

The O
Humira B-DRUG

saved O
my O
life O
. O
They O

the O

Humira B-DRUG

Oh O
wow O
thats O
crazy O
it O
took O
four O
years O
to O
diagnose O
. O
How O
has O
the O
botox B-DRUG
injections I-DRUG
helped O
I O
heard O
if O
them O
but O
never O
tried O
it O
. O
Yea O
your O
diet O
is O
pretty O
important O
with O
GP B-DIS

True O
, O
Thanks O
for O
the O
quick O
and O
informative O
replies O

Yes O
mine O
are O
getting B-DIS
larger I-DIS
and O
like O
forming B-DIS
together I-DIS
almost O
. O
some O
are O
peeling B-DIS
and O
some O
are O
like O
yellowish B-DIS
on I-DIS
the I-DIS
inside I-DIS
now O
but O
still O
looks O
horrible O
. O
how O
long O
did O
it O
take O
to O
go O
away O

The O
process O
failed O
me O
hard O
on O
the O
patient O
education O
piece O
and O
the O
followup O
was O
horrible O
. O
I O
started O
using O
sleepyhead B-DRUG
and O
went O
back O
through O
my O
Numbers O
... O
My O
doctor O
pushed O
for O
surgery O
and O
I O
did O
not O
understand O
why O
, O
he O
would O
not O
tell O
me O
what O
his O
expectations O
were O
. O
He O
would O
not O
give O
me O
any O
expectations O
. O
He O
never O
mentioned O
mask O
or O
what O
its O
importance O
was O
. O
I O
doubt O
he O
knew O
what O
machine O
I O
had O
Why O
I O
didn O
t O
figure O
it O
out O
sooner O
is O
a O
long O
story O
, O
but O
the O
bottom O
line O
is O
that O
its O
disgusting O
that O
I O
ve O
had O
to O
teach O
myself O
, O
through O
trial O
and O
error O
and O
a O
few O
idiotic O
mistakes O
. O
For O
months O
I O
just O
thought O
this O
is O
how O
it O
is O
**TLDR** O
a O
year O
wasted O
because O
I O
did O
not O
know O
something O
was O
horribly O
wrong O
. O

Thanks O
Just O
got O
back O
from O
the O
surgery B-DIS
and O
no O
vertigo B-DIS
attacks I-DIS
today O
, O
hopefully O
this O
will O
continue O

My O
teenage O
son O
has O
psoriasis B-DIS
just O
as O
I O
do O
. O
When O
we O
buzz O
his O
hair O
short O
the O
scalp B-DIS
psoriasis I-DIS
nearly O
disappears O
. O
Let O
it O
get O
just O
a O
little O
longer O
not O
even O
an O
inch O
and O
the O
psoriasis B-DIS
comes O
back O
. O
Must O
be O
that O
air O
and O
sun O
getting O
to O
the O
skin O
We O
ask O
the O
barber O
for O
a O
4 O
on O
top O
and O
2 O
on O
the O
back O
sides O
. O
Any O
longer O
and O
it O
doesn O
t O
seem O
to O
clear O
his O
skin O
. O
I O
imagine O
going O
with O
a O
2 O
blade O
all O
over O
would O
improve O
it O
even O
more O
, O
but O
he O
likes O
a O
little O
more O
on O
top O
. O

I O
use O
them O
during O
allergy B-DIS
season O
. O
They O
don O
t O
fix O
my O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
on O
their O
own O
, O
but O
they O
make O
PAP O
treatment O
much O
more O
effective O

I O

in O
the O
affected O
ear O
is O
still O
relatively O
good O
. O
I O
would O
be O
willing O
to O
sacrifice O
a O
little O
hearing O
to O
stop O
the O
attacks B-DIS
though O
. O

I O
track O
my O
stuff O
with O
a O
phone O

Best O
decision O
-- O
when O
I O
remember O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
info O
. O
I O
also O
realized O
that O
my O
allergies B-DIS
have O
been O
acting O
up O
this O
winter O
and O
I O
seem O
to O
have O
more O
issues O
with O
dizziness B-DIS
when O
I O
m O
super B-DIS
congested I-DIS
runny B-DIS
nose I-DIS
, O
face B-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
etc O
. O
However O
, O
my O
doctor O
didn O
t O
think O
there O
was O
a O
connection O
. O

Welcome O
The O
first O
months O
tend O
to O
be O
the O
most O
hard O
and O
confusing O
. O
Try O
to O
relax O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
after O
diagnosis O
and O
made O
it O
much O
harder O
for O
me O
. O
I O
also O
researched O
myself O
silly O
and O
that O
was O
not O
good O
at O
all O
. O
If O
you O
have O
any O
questions O
or O
symptoms O
you O
can O
t O
make O
sense O
of O
, O
call O
your O
neurologist O
. O
For O
everything O
MS B-DIS
related O
you O
should O
talk O
about O
with O
a O
neuro O
. O
GPs O
aren O
t O
specialized O
enough O
. O
My O
GP O
sees O
me O
as O
the O
medical O
expert O
on O
MS B-DIS
when O
we O
two O
are O
talking O
- O
he O
freely O
admits O
he O
doesn O
t O
have O
the O
specific O
knowledge O
required O
to O
give O
more O
than O
very O
broad O
advice O
. O
If O
you O
need O
to O
vent O
, O
we O
are O
here O
Good O

As O

I O

the O

Just O
an O
easy O
fix O

Now O
that O
I O
have O
my O

in O
check O
, O
I O
have O
so O
much O
less O
issues O
. O
I O
know O
it O
s O
annoying O
to O
hear O
but O
trust O
me O
, O
it O
s O
so O
worth O
it O
to O
change O
your O
diet O
and O
get O
your O
symptoms O
under O
control O
. O
Either O
way O
I O
wish O
you O
the O

My O
RA O
dr O
said O
the O
goal O
was O
pain B-DIS
less O
than O
3 O
10 O
and O
no O
stiffness B-DIS
. O
Flares B-DIS
will O
happen O
and O
can O
be O
treated O
, O
but O
anything O
above O
the O
threshold O
she O
set O
meant O
the O
meds O
were O
not O
working O
- O
3 O
DMARDs O
and O
3 O
biologicals O
later O
and O
I O
m O
close O
to O
that O
goal O
. O
It O
took O
2 O
years O
of O
changing O
meds O
though O
. O

If O
it O
s O
a O
good O
ENT O
, O
he O
will O
refer O
you O
to O
get O
an O
MRI O
, O
EConch O
and O
C-Vemp O
tests O
these O
are O
Meniere O
s O
Specific O
as O
well O
as O
a O
comprehensive O
audiology O
exam O
. O
I O
had O
those O
done O
and O
it O
resulted O
in O
the O
discovery O
of O
my O
Meniere O
s. O
good O

may O
you O

Trazodone B-DRUG
Normally O

as O
an O
anti-depressant O

I O
had O
taken O
Paxil B-DRUG
for O
years O
as O
an O
Anti-Depressant O
, O
it O
helped O
with O
depression B-DIS
but O
man O
that O
stuff O
had O
some O
really O
weird O
side O
effects O
for O
me O
and O
took O
forever O
to O
wean O
off O
that O
. O
These O
days O
to O
keep O

best O

It O

just O

a I-DIS
little I-DIS

out I-DIS
the I-DIS
urethra I-DIS
, O
then O
sweet O
relief O
for O
a O
while O
. O
About O
20 O
minutes O
later O
it O
started O
to O
hurt O
, O
and O
it O
got O
worse O
until O
it O
was O
worse B-DIS
than I-DIS
with I-DIS
the I-DIS
stent I-DIS
in I-DIS
. O
Stayed O
that O
way O
for O
about O
2 O
hours O
, O
then O
slowly O
started O
to O
get O
better O
. O
I O
suspect O
removing O
it O
irritated B-DIS
everything O
enough O
to O
swell B-DIS
shut I-DIS
temporarily I-DIS
. O
Now O
I O
m O
just O
generally O
sore B-DIS
all I-DIS
through I-DIS
my I-DIS
abdomen I-DIS

nothing O
like O

I O

I O

this O

my O

the O
worst O
you O
could O
imagine O

was O
just O
there O
yesterday O

more O
seem O
to O
lie O

the O
beneficial O
side O

I O
get O
severe B-DIS
seasonal I-DIS
allergies I-DIS

around O
60 O
times O
a O
day O

blowing B-DIS
my I-DIS
nose I-DIS
maybe O
200 O
times O

right O
now O
it O
s O
covered O

I O
did O

it O

I O

go O
for O
weekly O
allergy O
shots O
with O
the O
occasional O
Zyrtec B-DRUG
I O
have O
to O
really O
say O
that O
if O
your O
allergies O
are O
making O
you O
miserable O
, O
get O
rid O
of O
them O
... O
You O
might O
find O
out O
that O
your O
Meniere O
s O
is O
allergy-related O
and O
you O
will O
be O
much O
happy O
not O
dropping O
so O
much O
money O
on O

... O
among O
other O
things O

I O
wish O
I O
had O
a O
suggestion O
to O
help O
you..but O
I O
do O
have O
a O
related O
comment O
. O
I O
had O
an O
increase O
in O
depression B-DIS
and O
anxiety B-DIS
that O
I O
realized O
had O
occured O
when O
I O
started O
on O
lyrica B-DRUG
. O
lyrica B-DRUG
has O
helped O
my O
pain B-DIS
immensely O
and O
allowed O
me O
to O
quit O
daily O
opiod B-DRUG
use O
. O
I O
am O
currently O
working O
to O
slowly O
decrease O
the O
dosage O
of O
lyrica B-DRUG
to O
help O
with O
the O
depression B-DIS
. O
There O
are O
so O
many O
drugs O
to O
help O
us O
with O
autoimmune B-DIS
diseases I-DIS
but O
the O
side O
effects O
unfortunately O
add O
new O
problems O
for O
us O
to O
deal O
with O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
find O
a O
way O
to O
get O
past O
your O
issues O
, O
just O
remember O
there O
are O
thousands O
of O
us O
that O
share O
your O

are O

lots O

good O
tips O
over O
there O

i O
don O
t O
know.. O
i O
think O
it O
probably O
shows O
up O
as O
a O
symptom O
for O
several O
things O
... O
I O
ve O
had O
moments O
when O
i O
can O
t O
talk O
to O
someone O
and O
need O
to O
go O
lay O
down O
for O
a O
bit O
and O
it O
s O
as O
much O
dizziness B-DIS
as O
it O
is O
confusion B-DIS
or O
a O
sort O
of O
numbness.. B-DIS
like B-DIS
i I-DIS
just I-DIS
got I-DIS
kicked I-DIS
in I-DIS
the I-DIS
head I-DIS
. O
go O
around O
in O
circles O
for O
a O
long O
time O
and O
see O
how O
clear O
your O
thoughts O
are O
. O
like O
a O
balloon O
being O
expanded O
in O
my O
head O
. O
the O
vestibular B-DIS
system I-DIS
is O
a O
weird O
thing O
. O

ResMed B-DRUG
provide O
a O
12-to-24 O

my O
stupid O

One O
of O
the O
worst O
symptoms O
of O
IBS B-DIS
is O
its O
impact O
on O
a O
patient O
s O
quality O
of O
life O
. O
This O
disease O
is O
truly O
awful O
and O
because O
we O
look O
ok O
normally O
people O
don O
t O
tend O
to O
play O
down O
our O
experiences O
. O
There O
are O
ways O
you O
can O
work O
toward O
taking O
your O
life O
back O
piece O
by O
piece O
. O
You O
might O
not O
get O
back O
everything O
you O
want O
, O
but O
you O
need O
to O
fight O
for O
the O
things O
that O
are O
important O
to O
you O
. O
Here O
is O
an O
article O
about O
living O
with O
IBS B-DIS
and O
still O
living O
I O
like O
that O
it O
talks O
about O
how O
much O
food O
is O
ingrained O
in O
our O
culture O
and O
that O
this O
causes O
so O
many O
problems O
for O
us O
. O

Symptoms O
include O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
urinary I-DIS
tract I-DIS
always O
and O
puss B-DIS
in I-DIS
urination I-DIS
and O
frequent B-DIS
urination I-DIS
. O
What O
kind O
of O
foods O
do O
I O
need O
to O
eat O

throws O
the O

a O
line O

have O
taken O
him O
one O

him O
a O

not O
bash O

At O

for O
me O

Now O
I O
use O
this O
which O
isn O

quite O
as O
comfortable O

completely O
eliminates O
the O

Ehlers B-DIS
Danlos I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
It O
s O
a O
disease O

of O
its O
own O

most O
types O
having O
distinct B-DIS
genetic I-DIS
mutations I-DIS

I O
haven O
t O
tried O
them O
Someone O
said O
something O
about O
them O

system O

since O
my O
ana O
is O
positive O
and O
I O
have O
low O
C3 O
and O
C4 O
factors O
it O
seems O
my O
immune O
system O
is O
probably O
over O
active O
as O
it O
is O
. O
It O
s O
just O
so O
insane O
because O
we O
might O
not O
even O
all O
have O
the O
same O
disease O
. O
I O
was O
reading O
an O
article O
about O
how O
they O
started O
to O
suspect O
an O
autoimmune O
link O
when O
they O
realised O
that O
patients O
undergoing O
chemo O
experienced O
a O
remission O
of O
their O
CFS B-DIS
symptoms O
. O
But O
I O
ve O
also O
read O
other O
articles O
and O
studies O
that O
state O
an O
autoimmune O
link O
is O
unlikely O
. O
I O
ve O
read O
a O
few O
things O
here O
and O
there O
that O
people O
with O
CFS O
sometimes O
have O
the O
same O
blood O
work O
as O
me O
, O
but O
not O
all O
do O
obviously O
. O
Maybe O
we O
just O
have O
the O
same O
symptoms O
and O
something O
else O
entirely O
. O
I O
guess O
we O
can O
all O
just O
do O
whatever O
seems O
to O
help O
. O

Mine O
is O
atrocious O
. O
It O
s O
a O
mix O
of O
cursive O
and O
print O
and O
varies O
a O
lot O
depending O
on O
so O
many O
factors O
. O
Which O
is O
strange O
, O
because O
I O
ve O
devoted O
so O
much O
time O
to O
art O
and O
hand-eye O
coordination O
during O
my O
career O
. O
And O
illustration O
is O
my O
hobby O

Yeah O
I O
just O
finished O
blocking O
him O
on O
everything O
. O
If O
I O
find O
someone O
who O
s O
worth O
stressing B-DIS
this O
much O
for O
, O
maybe O
I O
ll O
try O
harder O
. O
But O
for O
lots O
of O
reasons O
, O
he O
s O
not O
worth O
it O
. O

This O
attitude O
is O
ridiculous O
. O
Crohn O
s O
is O
only O
part O
of O
my O
life O
and O
I O
don O
t O
need O
to O
run O
around O
telling O
everyone O
I O
know O
. O
I O
talk O
about O
it O
when O
it O
s O
relevant O
. O
Otherwise O
you O
re O
just O
annoying O
people O
or O
making O
them O
uncomfortable O
always O
pronouncing O
about O
your O
illness O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
people O
have O
something O
going O

us O

For O
the O
dryness B-DIS

try O
using O
a O
bit O

lube O
for O
a O
quick O
fix O

to O
stop O
the O
chaffing B-DIS

for O
the O

uncomfortable B-DIS
as O

what O
it O

you O
don O
t O
like O
it O
If O
it O
s O
painful O

then O
ignore O
me O

I O
have O
lumps B-DIS

that O
as O
well O
on O
the O
top O
of O
my O
labia O
majora O
that O
I O
can O
slide O

After O
. O
We O
met O
in O
2010 O
, O
not O
long O
before O
I O
quit O
grad O
school O
. O
We O
got O
together O
not O
long O
after O
I O
d O
given O
up O
the O
program O
. O
- O

I O
have O
these O
delusions B-DIS
that O
I O
ve O
become O
intrisically O
spiritually O
connected O
with O
a O
woman O
. O
So O
much O
so O
that O
the O
world O
around O
me O
is O
responding O
to O
her O
and O
our O
connection O
. O
I O
am O
emotionally B-DIS
disconnecting I-DIS
because O
it O
s O
exhausting O
and O
because O
I O
can O
t O
see O
her O
and O
don O
t O
care O
. O
this O
shit O
is O
probably O
all O
in O
my O
head O
and O
god O
put O
me O
through O
it O
to O
make O
me O
think O
and O
teach O
me O
lessons O
so O
that O
when O
I O
enter O
the O
romantic O
and O
sexual O
stratosphere O
, O
i O
don O
t O
end O
up O
in O
shit O
situations O
that O
I O
can O
t O
get O
out O
of O
. O
i O
also O
think O
i O
m O
understanding O
her O
pain O
. O
perhaps O
she O
would O
have O
taken O
my O
side O
in O
all O
of O
this O
if O
she O
could O
see O
me O
. O
i O
definitely O
would O
have O
taken O
her O
side O
if O
she O
went O
through O
this O
before O
we O
met O
. O
but O
, O
she O
didn O
t O
know O
me O
back O
then O
, O
and O
she O
can O
t O
help O
me O
right O
now O
. O
i O
get O
what O
it O
feels O
like O
to O
be O
blamed O
for O
a O
bunch O
of O
shit O
that O
wasn O
t O
your O
fault O
and O
to O
go O
further O
and O
further O
down O
a O
hole O
until O
you O
have O
no O
one O
who O
gives O
a O
shit O
about O
you O
. O
then O
i O
type O
shit O
like O
that O
and O
well O
up O
a O
bit O
and O
feel O
like O
we O
have O
an O
incredible O
understanding O
of O
eachother O
and O
sort O
of O
hope O
to O
see O
her O
again O
. O
that O
makes O
me O
feel O
as O
though O
i O
m O
feeding O
a O
karpman O
drama O
triangle O
and O
will O
drive O
her O
further O
into O
the O
victim O
role O
. O
i O
would O
be O
the O
rescuer O
in O
that O
scenario O
but O
in O
no O
other O
possible O
triangles O
that O
i O
m O
a O
part O
of O
i O
have O
no O
fucking O
clue O
what O
everyone O
thinks O
about O
me O
and O
i O
keep O
getting O
worse O
and O
worse O
so O
i O
emotionally B-DIS
disconnect I-DIS
from O
everyone O
. O
things O
are O

simple O
and O
i O
can O
have O
fun O
until O
i O
m O
better O
and O
could O
handle O
a O
relationship O
. O
i O
assume O
i O
ll O
never O
see O
her O
again O
and O
don O
t O
hold O
out O
hope O
. O
i O
forgive O
and O
wish O
her O
the O
best O
. O
then O
i O
speak O
with O
god O
and O
make O
the O
right O
decision O
by O
getting O
out O
of O
here O
. O
i O
ve O
been O
conditioned O
. O
pavlovian O
shit O
. O
this O
might O
be O
the O
basis O
of O
all O
emotional B-DIS
addiction I-DIS
it O
rained O
heavily O
briefly O
and O
i O
assume O
something O
fucked O
up O
happened O
. O
now O
it O
s O
sunny O
again O
. O

Just O
got O
my O
second O
ileostomy B-DIS
last O
Monday O
, O
and O
today O
is O
the O
first O
day O
that O
I O
am O
starting O
to O
feel O
like O
myself O
. O
I O
m O
certainly O
still O
sore B-DIS
ugh O
, O
that O
sneeze O
this O
morning O
but O
I O
m O
able O
to O
hobble O
around O
the O
house O
and O
get O
myself O
out O
of O
bed O
, O
so O
that O
s O
a O
start O
I O
actually O
felt O
remarkably O
good O
the O
two O
days O
immediately O
after O
surgery O
, O
but O
being O
on O
IV O
pain O
meds O
and O
using O
an O
automatic O
bed O
shields O
the O
difficulty O
of O
recovery O
a O
bit O
. O
I O
m O
currently O
staying O
at O
my O
mom O
s O
to O
recover O
, O
but O
hope O
to O
be O
back O
to O
my O
own O
place O
between O
3-4 O
weeks O
. O
I O
can O
t O
quite O
tell O
if O
you O
also O
had O
your O
rectum O
removed O
, O
I O
had O
that O
done O
with O
my O
first O
ileostomy B-DIS
surgery I-DIS
, O
and O
it O
definitely O
made O
the O
recovery O
a O
bit O
longer O
. O
I O
had O
an O
infected B-DIS
incision I-DIS
that O
prolonged O
my O
recovery O
a O
bit O
, O
but O
I O
was O
able O
to O
travel O
internationally O
about O
2 O
months O
later O
albeit O
not O
at O
my O
full O
strength O
, O
but O
I O
managed O
Good O
luck O
with O
your O
recovery O

I O
won O
t O
say O
it O
was O
easy O
but O
I O
have O
one O
thing O
that O
has O
kept O
me O
out O
of O
being O
bedbound B-DIS
and O
basically O
giving O
up O
bloody O
mindedness O
. O
Which O
is O
ironic O
and O
makes O
me O
want O
to O
slap O
people O
when O
they O
then O
trot O
out O
the O
well O
if O
you O
tried O
harder O
and O
We O
all O
have O
difficulty O
with O
exercise O
, O
you O
just O
have O
to O
push O
past O
it O
. O
If O
i O
didn O
t O
already O
do O
that O
then O
I O
d O
be O
bedbound O
, O
in O
Depends O
and O
a O
near O
vegetable O
. O
If O
they O
felt O
the O
pain B-DIS
and O
exhaustion B-DIS
I O
and O
most O
of O
us O
felt O
on O
a O
day O
to O
day O
basis O
they O
d O
be O
bitching O
far O
worse O
than O
I O
ever O
do O
. O

Not O
sad O
, O
beautiful O
and O
mysterious O
. O

My O
hyper-fixations B-DIS
are O
really O
embarrassing O
. O
I O
ll O
think O
and O
daydream O
about O
and O
reference O
my O
particular O
obsession O
constantly O
- O
it O
s O
hard O
not O
to O
openly O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
but O
sometimes O
when O
the O
topic O
is O
brought O
up O
I O
can O
t O
stop O
talking O
. O

That O
s O
awesome O
What O

Fellow O
CNA O
here O
I O
always O
get O
asked O
when O
I O
m O
going O
to O
nursing O
school O
or O
furthering O
my O
education O
. O
I O
m O
always O
at O
a O
loss O
though O
as O
I O
love O
being O
an O
aide O
. O
I O
feel O
it O
s O
more O
personal O
than O
being O
a O
nurse O
. O
Do O
you O
ever O
get O
the O
same O
questions O
or O
feel O
pressured O
to O
be O
more O
Do O
you O
want O
to O
go O
further O
into O
nursing O

Do O
you O
have O
BPD B-DIS
Somethingsomethingdichotomousthinking O
. O

We O
run O
a O
group O
for O
carers O
and O
people O
with O
dementia B-DIS
, O
and O
the O
two O
go O
in O
separate O
rooms O
for O
1.5 O
hours O
so O
that O
the O
carers O
can O
get O
support O
. O
The O
outbursts B-DIS
tend O
to O
happen O
in O
the O
last O
half O
hour O
, O
and O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
need O
for O
comfort O
because O
she O
s O
been O
without O
her O
husband O
. O
I O
ve O
always O
assumed O
that O
s O
what O
it O
is O
. O
I O
m O
only O
thinking O
about O
the O
blood O
sugar O
now O
because O
we O
have O
snacks O
, O
and O
this O
week O
she O
ate O
a O
lot O
of O
biscuits O
cookies O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
session O
and O
then O
was O
a O
lot O
more O
unsettled B-DIS
than O
usual O
towards O
the O
end O
. O
Actually O
became O
rather O
aggressive B-DIS
. O
It O
just O
got O
me O
thinking O
about O
whether O
it O
could O
be O
a O
spike B-DIS
in I-DIS
blood I-DIS
sugar I-DIS
that O
causes O
her O
to O
become O
unsettled O
towards O
the O
end O
. O
Or O
even O
if O
it O
contributes O
a O
small O
amount O
. O
It O
could O
be O
a O
coincidence O
of O
course O
, O
but O
I O
just O
thought O
I O
d O
see O
if O
anyone O
else O
had O
noticed O
any O
similar O
behaviours O
related O
to O
blood O
glucose O
levels O
. O
Planning O
to O
speak O
to O
her O
husband O
next O
week O
about O
how O
the O
diabetes B-DIS
is O
managed O
, O
and O
maybe O
try O
to O
find O
some O
low O
carb O
snacks O
for O
her O
to O
try O
. O
Thanks O
for O
your O
input O

It O
sounds O
like O
you O
might O
have O
a O
mild O
version O
of O
CFS B-DIS
. O
The O
loperamide B-DRUG
may O
or O
may O
not O
have O
affected O
your O
previous O
test O
. O
Measuring O
ACTH O
and O
cortisol O
in O
CFS B-DIS
isn O
t O
terribly O
useful O
, O
as O
they O
are O
usually O
normal O
, O
and O
only O
sometimes O
low O
. O
It O
is O
only O
the O
ACTH B-DIS
or I-DIS
cortisol I-DIS
rise I-DIS
in O
response O
to O
a O
stressor O
that O
generally O
tends O
to O
be O
low O
in O
CFS B-DIS
. O
That O
s O
what O
the O
ITT O
tests O
for O
. O
The O
HPA O
axis O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
positive O
and O
negative O
feedback O
and O
compensatory O
mechanisms O
, O
so O
it O
s O
not O
quite O
as O
simple O
as O
low O
ACTH O
resulting O
in O
low B-DIS
cortisol I-DIS
. O
See O
for O
example O
You O
were O
asking O
in O
another O
thread O
about O
what O
to O
do O
to O
increase O
cortisol O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
looking O
into O
this O
for O
about O
16 O
years O
, O
and O
there O
are O
no O
medications O
or O
supplements O
that O
will O
have O
any O
effect O
whatsoever O
. O
All O
those O
adrenal O
support O
supplements O
are O
basically O
bullshit O
. O
The O
problem O
is O
central O
in O
the O
brain O
, O
and O
if O
you O
just O
increase O
cortisol O
or O
ACTH O
it O
will O
cause O
more O
problems O
due O
to O
negative O
feedback O
. O
Only O
behavioural O
interventions O
will O
have O
any O
effect O
... O
reducing O
chronic B-DIS
stress I-DIS
which O
is O
what O
causes O
low O
cortisol O
, O
and O
then O
increasing O
positive O
activities O
which O
increases O
normalises O
HPA O
axis O

I O

3 O

my O

stayed O

that O

for O

minutes O
. O

Wow O
thanks O
for O
the O
response O
I O
had O
the O
exact O
same O
experience O
. O
Trying O
to O
work O
out O
when O
I O
was O
a O
skinny O
15 O
year O
old O
kid O
, O
not O
understanding O
why O
I O
would O
get O
sick O
every O
time O
I O
tried O
exercising O
when O
I O
had O
done O
sports O
4-5 O
times O
a O
week O
just O
a O
few O
years O
earlier O
. O
When O
I O
got O
sick O
the O
internet O
was O
around O
and O
there O
was O
probably O
ample O
information O
around O
, O
but O
the O
gradual O
onset O
made O
it O
much O
harder O
for O
doctors O
my O
own O
family O
and O
even O
for O
myself O
to O
take O
the O
illness O
serious O
. O
At O
which O
age O
did O
you O
get O
ill O
Also O
at O
what O
speed O
has O
your O
illness O
progressed O
And O
are O
you O
still O
constantly O
getting O
worse O
I O
am O
kinda O
worried O
I O
will O
be O
close O
to O
bedbound O
in O
10 O
years O
time O
, O
especially O
because O
I O
already O
spend O
around O
16 O
hours O
a O
day O
in O
bed O
on O
the O
couch O
at O
least O

Of O
course O
you O
are O
. O
You O
are O
just O
have O
wrong O
existential O
belief O
. O
But O
don O
t O
you O
worry O
. O
A O
round O
of O
CBT B-DIS
that O
you O
love O
so O
much O
will O
fix O
it O
in O
no O
time O
. O
Maybe O
then O
you O
will O
stop O
trashing O

Uhh O
, O
hello O
everyone O
. O
It O
s O
my O
first O
time O
here O
. O
I O
already O
made O
a O
post O
but O
I O
guess O
I O
should O
gives O
this O
a O
try O
as O
well O
. O
Today O
is O
just O
loneliness B-DIS
setting O
. O
The O
realization O
of O
how O
things O
are O
as O
opposed O
to O
how O
I O
wish O
they O
would O
be O
. O
Hopefully O
I O
ll O
wake O
up O
in O
a O
better O
mood O
tomorrow O
. O

It O
sounds O
like O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
put O
you O
in O
a O
good O
mindset O
. O
I O
can O
relate O
since O
, O
I O
believe O
my O
CFS B-DIS
symptoms O
are O
from O
Sinusitis B-DIS
, O
and O
won O
t O
be O
able O
to O
fully O
fix O
it O
for O
a O
month O
or O
two O
, O
So O
I O
can O
either O
push O
on O
my O
HW O
and O
try O
to O
pass O
my O
classes O
or O
give O
in O
and O
browse O
reddit O
all O
day O
. O

I O
m O
not O
sure O
I O
even O
kinda O
want O
it O
... O
I O
don O
t O
want O
it O
, O
I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
do O
. O
I O
don O
t O
even O
want O
accommodations O
. O
I O
deserve O
punishment O
for O
my O
failings O
. O
I O
don O
t O
deserve O
the O
support O
system O
I O
have O
, O
they O
re O
all O
wasting O
their O
time O
and O
maybe O
if O
I O
die O
they O
can O
focus O
on O
someone O
who O
wants O
to O
get O
better O
. O
This O
sounds O
so O
pessimistic O
and O
self-defeating O
lol O
. O
I O
just O
think O
I O
m O
, O
like O
, O
a O
fundamentally O
broken O
person O
mental B-DIS
illness I-DIS
, O
bad O
personality O
traits O
an O
d O
I O
m O
trying O
to O
do O
my O
best O
and O
make O
ppeople O
happy O
before O
I O
bail O
on O
this O
pitiful O
existence O
I O
gues O

They O
wouldn O
t O
do O
anything O
anyway O
, O
been O
there O
, O
it O
s O
got O
ta O
be O
the O
best O
government O
job O
ever O
. O
Sit O
on O
your O
ass O
in O
an O
air O
conditioned O
building O
and O
get O
paid O
for O
nothing O
. O

I O
recently O
did O
two O
weeks O
in O
Europe O
. O
I O
was O
worried O
about O
the O
same O
thing O
however O
I O
was O
fine O
for O
most O
of O
the O
trip O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
get O
sick B-DIS
until O
I O
got O
back O
to O
the O
states O
. O
I O
guess O
my O
body O
crashed O
a O
bit O
but O
I O
recovered O
fairly O
quickly O
. O

Wait O
is O
this O
a O
serious O
or O
sarcastic O
comment O
I O
ve O
never O
had O
a O
doctor O
tell O
me O
I O
m O
likely O
repressing O
something O
. O
In O
fact O
, O
I O
ve O
been O
warned O
against O
doctors O
who O
do O
this O
. O
But O
, O
either O
way O
, O
I O
m O
not O
so O
sure O
it O
s O
about O
blame O
as O
much O
as O
causation O
. O
I O
have O
never O
told O
anyone O
that O
I O
was O
abused O
, O
most O
definitely O
not O
my O
family O
. O
I O
have O
just O
brought O
this O
up O
to O
doctor O
s O
because O
I O
m O
concerned O
as O
to O
why O
my O
mind O
does O
this O
and O
why O
it O
brings O
relief O
when O
I O
accept O
it O
. O
I O
really O
want O
to O
forgive O
and O
move O
on O
. O
But O
you O
can O
t O
forgive O
your O
family O
when O
they O
ve O
done O
you O
no O
wrong O
. O
So O
I O
m O
left O
feeling B-DIS
shameful I-DIS
, O
stupid B-DIS
, O
and O
invaludated O

don O
t O
have O
the O
right O
to O
bring O

I O

Thank O
you O
for O
sharing O
. O
I O
agree O
, O
it O
can O
still O
feel O
pretty O
isolating B-DIS
. O
I O
know O
I O
m O
not O
the O
only O
person O
to O
ever O
go O
through O
this O
but O
it O
feels O
like O
I O
am O
sometimes O
. O
It O
feels O
good O
to O
get O
this O
off O
my O
chest O
, O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
feel O
a O
bit O
of O
relief O
as O
well O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
the O
absolute O
best O
, O
and O
I O
m O
sure O
your O
mom O
would O
as O
well O
. O

You O
would O
probably O
get O
real O
low- O
like O
probably O
low O
enough O
that O
brain B-DIS
damage I-DIS
is O
a O
possibility- O
unless O
you O
realized O
it O
quick O
enough O
to O
consume O
enough O
carbs O
to O
counteract O
all O
that O
insulin B-DRUG
. O
If O
you O
re O
wondering O
if O
it O
would O
be O
fatal O
, O
it O
possibly O
could O
, O
but O
insulin B-DRUG
is O
actually O
remarkably O
ineffective O
as O
a O
method O
for O
that O
. O

Think O
of O
the O
positives O
of O
BPD.BPD B-DIS
is O
the O
exact O
opposite O
of O
a O
Narcissist B-DIS
so O
you O
feel B-DIS
too I-DIS
much I-DIS
empathy I-DIS
which O
means O
you O
are O
a O
good O
person.I O
had O
the O
same O
feeling O
too O
until O
I O
realized O
there O
are O
positives.Manipulation O
is O
a O
defense O
mechanism O
and O
you O
just O
have O
to O
try O
to O
find O
a O
new O
one.If O
you O
feel O
threatened O
wait O
48 O
hours O
before O
resorting O
to O
that O
tactic.After O
48 O
hours O
you O
will O
either O
have O
a O
mood B-DIS
swing I-DIS
OR O
you O
will O
realize O
the O
person O
isn O
t O
worth O
manipulating.I O
d O
add O
BPD B-DIS
people O
like O
us O
often O
draw O
people O
with O
NPD B-DIS
who O
are O
our O
exact O
opposite O
so O
eventually O
they O
will O
abandon O
us O
no O
matter O
what O
because O
they O
get O
off O
on O
it.Learn O
to O
avoid O
toxic O
people O
and O

yourself O

I O

basic I-DIS

Did O
you O
ever O
manage O
to O
get O
a O
confirmed O
diagnosis O
for O
h-pots B-DIS
My O
fiance O
has O
been O
confirmed O
as O
having O
pots B-DIS
by O
mayo O
twice O
, O
but O
we O
have O
strong O
reason O
to O
believe O
that O
it O
might O
be O
h-pots B-DIS
, O
but O
we O
can O
t O
seem O
to O
get O
any O
testing O
done O
for O
it O
because O
the O
facilities O
here O
are O
ill-equipped O
or O
we O
only O
get O
replies O
of O
lol O
what O
s O
pots B-DIS
. O
Mayo O
has O
been O
less O
than O
helpful O
with O
us O
too O
. O
They O
were O
the O
first O
ones O
we O
contacted O
that O
knew O
of O
the O
blood O
test O
that O
s O
needed O
but O
refused O
to O
perform O
it O
. O
Hell O
she O
finally O
had O
a O
blood O
test O
to O
be O
done O
today O
for O
it O
, O
only O
for O
the O
lab O
to O
call O
her O
and O
her O
doctor O
and O
say O
they O
won O
t O
use O
the O
standing O
blood O
draw O
for O
testing O
because O
it O
s O
unusual O
and O
they O
don O
t O
know O
what O
pots B-DIS
is O
. O
Even O
after O
talking O
to O
her O
and O
her O
doctor O
again O
they O
refuse O
. O
As O
per O
why O
we O
think O
it O
s O
h-pots B-DIS
it O
s O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
same O
things O
you O
mention O
. O
her O
blood B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
and I-DIS
heart I-DIS
rate I-DIS
will I-DIS
spike I-DIS
, O
often O
so O
high O
that O
it O
causes O
fainting B-DIS
spells I-DIS
. O
she O
s O
lit O
up O
twice O
on O
a O
tilt O
table O
for O
pots B-DIS
, O
and O
in O
the O
past O
they O
ve O
tried O
the O
typical O
treatment O
of O
beta B-DRUG
blockers I-DRUG
with O
her O
and O
she O
responded O
very O
poorly O
to O
it O
, O
something O
to O
my O
understanding O
is O
very O
typical O
with O
h-pots B-DIS
sufferers O
. O
It O
just O
feels O
like O
we O
re O
running O
out O
of O
options O
here O
with O
something O
that O
might O
be O
an O
answer O
that O
s O
staring O
us O
in O
the O
face O
. O
Even O
if O
it O
s O
not O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
it O
ruled O
out O
so O
we O
can O
move O
on O
. O
She O
s O
unable O
to O
work O
because O
of O
the O
fainting B-DIS
, O
and O
because O
of O

her O
young O
age O
any O
chance O
at O
disability O
is O
a O
long O
way O
away O
, O
had O
to O
have O
a O
lawyer O
to O
appeal O
for O
a O
court O
case O
due O
to O
several O
rejections O
for O
disability O
, O
they O
don O
t O
expect O
to O
actually O
see O
her O
until O
early O
next O
year O
. O
So O
please O
any O
info O
at O
all O
you O
could O
share O
could O
make O
a O
life O
altering O
difference O
for O
her O
. O

Echoing O

I O
personally O
just O
can O
t O
eat O

much O
veggies O
, O
whole O
grains O
that O
aren O
t O
rice O
, O
or O
other O

are O

Red O

also O
trigger O
me O
more O
often O
than O
not O
. O
I O
eat O
tuna O
fish O
with O
rice-based O
crackers O
to O
boost O
my O
protein O
intake O
on O

I O
don O
t O
want O
a O
lot O
of O
carbs O
or O
even O
on O
bad O
Crohns B-DIS
days O
I O
also O
tend O
to O
snack O
more O
- O
big O
meals O
are O
too O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
portion O
control O
. O
If O
you O
*can* O
exercise O
it O
s O
great O
but O
I O
generally O
just O
try O
to O
walk O
as O
much O
as O
I O
can O
. O

It O
s O
really O
hard O
because O
my O
grandpa O
is O
really O
stubborn O
. O
He O
will O
barely O
let O
me O
help O
him O
with O
anything O
. O
I O
basically O
have O
to O
trick O
him O
into O
doing O
things O
that O
I O
need O
him O
to O
do O
like O
take O
his O
medicine O
eat O
food O
stuff O
like O
that O
. O
So O
I O
don O
t O
know O
how O
much O
help O
a O
random O
person O
coming O
to O
the O
house O
would O
really O
do O
. O
What O
exactly O
do O
those O
people O
do O
im O
not O
really O
sure O
I O
haven O
t O
looked O
into O
it O
at O
all O
. O

I O
don O
t O
know O
if O
you O
re O
in O
a O
legal O
area O
, O
but O
Marijuana B-DRUG
had O
been O
the O
go O
to O
medicine O
for O
me O
with O
my O
severe B-DIS
GP I-DIS
. O
It O
relieves O
the O
nausea B-DIS

reduces O
the O

issues I-DIS
I O
suffer O
. O

You O
are O
definitely O
not O
alone O
among O
people O
who O
have O
this O
disease O
, O
me O
included O
, O
but O
i O
find O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
parts O
about O
having O
Meniere O
s O
is O
being O
alone O
outside O
of O
those O
people O
who O
understand O
what O
it O
s O
like O
. O
Social B-DIS
isolation I-DIS
, O
irritability B-DIS
, O
and O
anxiety B-DIS
are O
very O
hard O
to O
overcome O
while O
suffering O
constant O
symptoms O
and O
people O
just O
can O
t O
understand O
what O
having O
an O
invisible O
illness O
is O
like O
. O
My O
best O
advice O
is O
to O
find O
the O
people O
you O
trust O
and O
sit O
down O
with O
them O
and O
explain O
what O
it O
s O
like O
until O
they O
understand O
. O
It O
could O
take O
awhile O
. O
Don O
t O
give O
up O
Meniere O
s O
from O
what O
i O
d O
read O
eventually O
burns O
itself O
out O
and O
most O
symptoms O
fade O
in O
intensity O
eventually O
. O

Sounds O
like O
plain O
fainting B-DIS
to O
me O
. O
It O
s O
always O
pretty O
draining O
. O

I O
just O
feel O

soul O

Thanks O
for O
your O

, O
it O

a O
lot O

Now O
when O
I O
think O
of O
it O
, O
this O
is O
technically O
a O
crime O
. O
But O
then O
it O
took O
me O
years O
to O
even O
call O
this O
technically O
being O
raped O
. O
Stupidity O
at O
its O
fullest O

Pain B-DIS
after O
removal O
-- O
discomfort B-DIS
for O
48 O
hours O
then O
it O
was O
like O
it O
ever O
happened O
. O

That O
s O
great O
I O
just O
started O
an O
MMO O
with O
some O
friends O
I O
never O
see O
and O
it O
is O
a O
much O
needed O
social O
outlet O
. O
Once O
you O
get O
past O
the O
nerd O
barrier O
and O
focus O
on O
the O
game O
mechanics O
, O
it O
s O
just O
like O
playing O
a O
regular O
team O
game O
. O

I O
think O
this O
blog O
post O
will O
help O
shed O
some O
light O
on O
what O
you O
re O
experiencing O
. O
Maybe O
you O
can O
ask O
your O
doctor O
for O
the O
same O
catecholamine O
test O
, O
although O
when O
I O
did O
, O
my O
doctor O
said O
it O
wouldn O
t O
be O
worth O
in O
my O
area O
because O
many O
labs O
aren O
t O
trained O
to O
don O
t O
properly O
. O

And O
it O
s O
still O
so O
so O
cool O
Kinda O
like O
the O
surgeons O
answer O
to O
playstation O

Maybe O
ask O
her O
GP O
, O
if O
she O
has O
one O
, O
to O
call O
her O
in O
for O
a O
general O
checkup O
and O
then O
do O
an O
evaluation O
of O
her O
mental O
state O
I O
think O
if O
the O
country O
she O
is O
in O
has O
poor O
healthcare O
, O
maybe O
getting O
a O
diagnosis O
sooner O
than O
later O
would O
allow O
you O
to O
get O
her O
placed O
on O
the O
waiting O
list O
for O
whatever O
State O
care O
home O
facilities O
there O
are O
, O
with O
more O
chance O
of O
actually O
being O
placed O
. O

I O
ve O
contacted O
a O
suicide B-DIS
prevention O
line O
but O
I O
feel O
like O
nothing O
they O
can O
say O
or O
do O
can O
help O
me O
. O
I O
m O
really O
struggling O
and O
I O
had O
prexisting O
depression B-DIS
ptsd B-DIS
anxiety B-DIS
prior O
to O
getting O
sick O
. O
Now O
this O
diagnosis O
has O
put O
me O
over O
the O
edge O
and O
I O
m O
kind O
of O
fighting O
the O
urge O
to O
jump O
out O
a O
window O

I O
have O
never O
used O
one O
, O
but O
I O
find O
that O
my O
pain B-DIS
levels O
often O
directly O
relate O
to O
the O
severity O
of O
MY O
dysautonomia B-DIS
symptoms O
. O
Have O
EDS B-DIS
. O

Could O
you O
post O
about O
this O
explain O
further O

Thanks O
for O
sharing O
. O
I O
understand O
those O
feelings O
all O
to O
well O
. O
The O
fact O
that O
you O
won O
t O
accept O
love O
from O
your O
supporting O
people O
doesn O
t O
mean O
that O
they O
do O
not O
love O
you O
. O
They O
do O
. O
They O
don O
t O
see O
you O
as O
useless O
, O
you O
do O
. O
You O
need O
help O
. O
The O
good O
thing O
here O
is O
that O
there O
is O
treatment O
. O
You O
can O
find O
self O
acceptence O
. O
It O
takes O
guts O
to O
admid O
that O
you O
have O
good O
qualities O
. O
Degrading O
yourself O
is O
easy O
. O
It O
is O
the O
safest O
option O
. O
Sorry O
for O
the O
spelling O
and O
grammar O
, O
English O
is O
not O
my O
first O
language O

Thanks O
for O
the O
tip O
but O
I O
just O
could O
never O
bring O
myself O
to O
eat O
drink O
anything O
called O
Soylent O
... O

Yes O
I O
m O
pretty O
sure O
. O
Just O
oxygen B-DIS
starved I-DIS
convulsions I-DIS
. O

I O
understand O
what O
you O
are O
saying O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
been O
helped O
by O
redditors O
before O
with O
my O
supplies O
. O
I O
m O
happy O
to O
pass O
that O
forward O
. O
While O
it O
would O
be O
super O
disappointing O
for O
someone O
to O
lie O
about O
needing O
free O
supplies O
, O
I O
m O
ok O
taking O
that O
chance O
. O
Plus O
, O
I O
can O
stalk O
people O
s O
post O
history O
to O
see O
if O
their O
need O
seems O
legit O

Thank O
you O
I O
m O
sorry O
you O
re O
in O
a O
similar O
situation O
, O
it O
can O
be O
really O
rough O
. O

Perfect O
. O
I O
ll O
try O

That O
makes O
more O
sense O
. O
Thought O
you O
were O
just O
hiding O
going O
to O
the O
bathroom O
, O
which O
I O
didn O
t O
understand O
. O

gt O
; O
walking O
for O
20 O
minutes O
will O
cause O
me O
to O
become O
ill B-DIS
the O
next O
day O
or O
days O
and O
visiting O
the O
doctor O
that O
is O
20 O
minutes O
of O
slow O
walking O
combined O
with O
answering O
questions O
for O
30 O
minutes O
will O
have O
lasting O
effects O
for O
a O
week O
give O
or O
take O
. O
That O
sounds O
like O
post-exertional B-DIS
malaise I-DIS
, O
one O
of O
the O
hallmarks O
of O
ME B-DIS
CFS B-DIS
. O
Your O
ongoing O
mission O
will O
be O
to O
self-pace O
so O
you O
don O
t O
live O
a O
push-cruch O
cycle O
all O
the O
time O
. O

Just O
plain O
old O
hypothryoidsm B-DIS
I O
think O
can O
be O
cured O
in O
a O
sense O
if O
you O
can O
find O
the O
triggers O
. O
Hashimotos B-DIS
on O
the O
otherhand O
which O
is O
autoimmune O
disease O
CAN O
NOT O
be O
cured O
and O
anyone O
who O
tells O
you O
otherwsise O
is O
a O
snake O
. O
You O
can O
t O
cure O
autoimmune O
diseases O
... O
..Possible O
to O
put O
them O
them O
hashimotos B-DIS
in O
remission O
but O
you O
can O
not O
cure O
them O
it O
. O

Usually O
it O
s O
dosage O
based O
. O
They O
know O
approximately O
what O
you O
should O
take O
for O
a O
certain O
weight O
. O
So O
if O
you O
re O
taking O
2 O
or O
3 O
times O
that O
, O
then O
you O
ve O
probably O
also O
got O
resistance O
. O

Very O
exciting O
, O
any O
idea O
when O
this O
would O
become O
available O
though O
I O
m O
in O
pain B-DIS
now O

Find O
different O
doctors O
Please O

I O
had O
gone O
to O
so O
many O
regular O
GIs O
and O
they O
all O
threw O
up O
their O
hands O
and O
told O
me O
to O
go O
see O
this O
specialist O
. O
He O
was O
by O
far O
the O
biggest O
help O
. O
My O
insurance O
did O
cover O
him O
though O
so O
it O
s O
not O
exactly O
the O
same O
situation O
but O
we O
would O
have O
paid O
out O
of O
pocket O
too O
for O
relief O

I O
m O
sorry O
you O
re O
feeling O
that O
way O
x O
I O
know O
sometimes O
a O
good O
mood O
feels O
too O
high O
to O
be O
normal O
and O
it O
s O
often O
followed O
by O
a O
crash O
, O
like O
a O
chemical O
in O
the O
brain O
floods O
into O
it O
and O
then O
suddenly O
leaves O
and O
the O
party O
is O
over O
Do O
you O
have O
any O
self-care O
activities O
that O
help O
you O
during O
tough O
times O

It O
is O
, O
and O
Byram O
does O
. O
It O
s O
just O
that O
they O
have O
a O
specific O
name O
for O
it O
and O
, O
when O
I O
had O
them O
, O
it O
was O
the O
only O
way O
I O
could O
reliably O
get O
them O
to O
have O
all O
the O
insurance O
details O
worked O
out O
before O
shipment O
. O

Didn O
t O
even O
think O
of O
that O

Exactly O
, O
what O
do O
they O
even O
think O
is O
so O
glamorous O
about O
it O

I O
feel O
you O
. O
I O
too O
have O
tried O
all O
the O
things O
. O
I O
still O
haven O
t O
found O
a O
total O
fix O
, O
but O
I O
m O
following O
Dr. O
McDougall O
s O
recommendations O
of O
a O
starch O
based O
diet O
and O
have O
felt O
the O
best O
of O
all O
the O
things O
I O
ve O
tried O
. O
More O
energy O
and O
motivation O
to O
continue O
and O
giving O
up O
dairy O
has O
made O
a O
big O
difference O
for O
me O
. O
You O
also O
might O
want O
to O
look O
into O
your O
liver O
function O
. O
I O
know O
this O
often O
times O
is O
an O
issue O
for O
others O
with O
Hashimotos B-DIS
, O
tend O
to O
have O
non-alcoholic B-DIS
fatty I-DIS
liver I-DIS
, O
which O
can O
really O
affect O
your O
overall O
constitution O
, O
and O
may O
be O
a O
missing O
link O
to O
address O
. O

This O
was O
the O
first O
PVFS B-DIS
symptom O
I O
had O
, O
and O
it O
kept O
on O
recurring O
. O
There O
seem O
to O
be O
a O
few O
posts O
about O
it O
on O
Phoenix O
rising O
too O
, O
so O
I O
reckon O
it O
is O
normal O
. O
A O
pain O
though O
- O

Eh O
I O
had O
a O
couple O
years O
of O
tripping O
monthly O
bi-monthly B-DIS
. O
No O
judgement O
here O
. O
P O
Now O
I O
m O
even O
more O
eager O
to O
trip O
again O
. O
... O
You O

for O

I O
did O
just O
get O

The O
two O
definitely O
complicate O

It O

How O
much O
water O
do O
you O

You O

you O
have O
an O

there O
is O
another O

You O

told O

; O
it O
s O
a O
very O
weird O

give O
you O

you O
re O
not O
alone O
on O
this O

imo O

like O

But O
, O
would O
be O
sure O
to O
see O
doc O
monday O
as O
you O
said O
. O

I O
usually O
drink O
cider O
and O
sometimes O
mixed O
drinks O
. O
Also O
wine O
on O
occasion O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
I O
ve O
noticed O
is O
I O
will O
go B-DIS
to I-DIS
the I-DIS
bathroom I-DIS
a I-DIS
lot I-DIS
. O
Otherwise O
, O
I O
have O
had O
a O
few O
flare B-DIS
ups I-DIS
on O
my O
first O
drink O
but O
I O
m O
sure O
that O
was O
in O
combination O
from O
drinking O
coffee O
that O
day O
or O
eating O
something O
acidic O
. O
Getting O
drunk O
usually O
doesn O
t O
make O
it O
worse O
for O
me O
. O

Who O
s O
your O
main O
provider O
right O
now O
... O
neuro B-DIS
Cardiovascular O
Pulmonary O
I O
think O
you O
need O
a O
cpet O
bc O
it O
could O
help O
figure O
out O
the O
fatigue B-DIS
. O
I O
also O
think O
that O
you O
need O
biochemical O
and O
neuro O
chemical O
testing O
. O

It O
might O
seem O
easy O
but O
it O
s O
hard O
for O
everyone O
at O
first O
I O
m O
doing O
the O
same O
kind O
of O
thing O
now O
. O
Cooking O
food O
usually O
makes O
it O
easier O
to O
digest O
. O
You O
probably O
know O
about O
the O
low O
fiber O
and O
low O
residue O
diets O
right O
The O
lists O
of O
food O
to O
avoid O
on O
those O
diets O
should O
give O
you O
a O
good O
starting O
point O
to O
know O
what O
s O
likely O
to O
bother O
you O
. O
I O
start O
with O
those O
diets O
and O
eliminate O
all O
those O
foods O
right O
away O
. O
That O
will O
also O
be O
the O
last O
stuff O
I O
introduce O
back O
. O
Avoiding O
those O
foods O
has O
really O
helped O
me O
. O
From O
what O
I O
understand O
, O
food O
will O
take O
about O
6-8 O
hours O
to O
actually O
reach O
your O
intestines O
, O
so O
things O
you O
eat O
theoretically O
shouldn O
t O
bother O
you O
after O
only O
2 O
hours O
unless O
you O
have O
stomach B-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O
But O
gas O
can O
travel O
quicker O
than O
food O
I O
think O
, O
and O
that O
can O
cause O
pain B-DIS
, O
so O
keep O
an O
eye O
out O
for O
gassy O
foods O
. O

I O
m O
39 O
now O
, O
been O
depressed B-DIS
for O
longer O
than O
17 O
years O
, O
but O
that O
s O
when O
it O
really O
started O
to O
ruin O
me O
. O
Countless O
medications O
, O
therapists O
, O
other O
, O
and O
I O
m O
worse O
than O
I O
ever O
have O
been O
. O
For O
some O
, O
they O
find O
something O
that O
helps O
them O
. O
For O
others O
... O
well O
, O
they O
don O
t O
call O
it O
the O
sweet O
release O
of O
death O
for O
no O
reason O
. O

I O
found O
it O
was O
a O
great O
sleep O
aid O
. O
First O
time O
in O
over O
20 O
years O
I O
actually O
slept O
8 O
hours O
. O
One O
time O
deal O
, O
so O
have O
to O
wait O
until O
a O
Colorado O
road O
trip O
to O
try O
it O
again O
. O
Unlike O

I O
was O
functional O
the O
next O
day O

Zero O
interest O
in O

, O
so O
only O
edible O
. O
Zero O
interest O
in O
getting O
high O
, O
or O
drunk O
, O
life O
is O
enough O
for O
a O
trip O
for O
me O

Can O
confirm O
I O
ve O
had O
and O
witnessed O
huge O
improvements O
at O
my O
RSB O
gym O
. O
More O
than O
just O
a O
workout O

Papaya B-DRUG
enzyme I-DRUG
is O
supposed O
to O
stimulate O
digestion O
, O
you O
can O
get O
it O
over O
the O
counter O
at O
a O
pharmacy O
. O
A O
little O
cannabis B-DRUG
can O
get O
me O
to O
stop O
throwing B-DIS
up I-DIS
usually O
. O
Sometimes O
chewing O
gum O
can O
help O
stimulate O
digestion O
. O
Maybe O
planning O
a O
liquid O
diet O
around O
when O
you O
usually O
get O
attacks O
. O
Sometimes O
light O
walks O
can O
help O
. O
I O
ll O
take O
my O
dog O
out O
where O
the O
good O
smells O
and O
let O
him O
sniff O
every O
thing O
he O
wants O
. O
But O
if O
I O
feel O
too B-DIS
sick I-DIS
to I-DIS
be I-DIS
standing I-DIS
that O
long O
I O
just O
lay O
down O
with O
a O
cool O
wash O
cloth O
over O
my O
eyes O
out O
over O
my O
neck O
. O

I O
ve O
had O
Raynaud O
s O
since O
2006 O
, O
diagnosed O
with O
T1D B-DIS
in O
2009 O
. O
There O
is O
evidence O
that O
Raynaud O
s O
is O
an O
autoimmune B-DIS
disease I-DIS
although O
there O
are O
other O
causes O
as O
well O
. O
There O
have O
been O
studies O
that O
suggest O
that O
individuals O
who O
have O
one O
autoimmune O
disease O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
get O
additional O
ones O
. O
So O
, O
do O
you O
have O
Raynaud O
s O
Maybe O
. O
It O
s O
not O
an O
absurd O
guess O
since O
you O
already O
have O
an O
autoimmue O
disorder O
. O
But O
go O
check O
with O
a O
doctor O
- O
. O
If O
you O
do O
, O
or O
even O
if O
you O
don O
t O
invest O
in O
some O
expensive O
, O
good O
quality O
wool O
socks O
. O
Sometimes O
I O
wear O
fingerless O
gloves O
when O
typing O
on O
my O
computer O
to O
keep O
my O
hands O
warm O
. O

Agreed O
. O
I O
kind O
of O
left O
that O
sentiment O
out O
. O
Some O
people O
aren O
t O
worth O
the O
time O
. O
But O
if O
you O
can O
find O
a O
few O
that O
you O
feel O
like O
you O
might O
can O
explain O
to O
, O
it O
really O
is O
worth O
the O
shot O
. O
I O
have O
a O
few O
friends O
who O
kind O
of O
get O
it O
and O
some O
who O
never O
will O
. O
It O
makes O
a O
big O
difference O
because O
you O
wind O
up O
just O
not O
really O
communicating O
with O
those O
people O
at O
all O
. O

There O
are O
online O
derms O
I O
won O
t O
link O
to O
any O
since O
I O
can O
t O
vouch O
for O
them O
but O
google O
will O
give O
you O
some O
options O
with O
prices O
starting O
around O
25 O
. O

MRI O
with O
contrast O
isn O
t O
always O
conclusive O
. O
There O
are O
lots O
of O
things O
that O
can O
cause O
lesions B-DIS
like O
the O
ones O
they O
call O
MS B-DIS
. O
Sometimes O
the O
spinal O
tap O
will O
come O
back O
with O
no O
results O
, O
true O
. O
This O
happened O
on O
my O
first O
one O
actually O
. O
When O
it O
DOES O
come O
back O
positive O
though O
, O
it O
is O
a O
very O
, O
very O
solid O
positive O
, O
and O
very O
, O
very O
specifically O
for O
MS B-DIS
. O
There O
s O
little O
else O
that O
holds O
the O
same O
certainty O
. O
Of O
course O
all O
the O
other O
tests O
corroborate O
, O
and O
they O
can O
diagnose O
MS B-DIS
even O
without O
the O
spinal O
tap O
. O
I O
d O
have O
one O
anyway O
, O
and O
defo O
get O
a O
second O
opinion O
. O
They O
do O
really O
push O
to O
diagnose O
MS B-DIS
much O
more O
and O
earlier O
these O
days O
, O
and O
that O
means O
putting O
people O
on O
drugs O
with O
debilitating O
side O
effects O
, O
that O
might O
not O
have O
otherwise O
been O
diagnosed O
with O
it O
at O
all O
. O
If O
someone O
only O
has O
very O
minor O
symptoms O
, O
or O
there O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
doubt O
, O
I O
d O
rather O
err O
on O
the O
side O
of O
caution O
. O
In O
that O
case O
I O
d O
really O
want O
the O
spinal O
tap O
to O
come O
back O
positive O
before O
starting O
on O
a O
program O
of O
drugs O
and O
all O
the O
horrors O
that O
can O
bring O
with O
it O
. O

Instead O
of O
being O
in O
the O
hospital O
for O
your O
steroid B-DRUG
IV I-DRUG
, O
can O
you O
get O
a O
visiting O
nurse O
to O
do O
it O
after O
work O
at O
night O
At O
least O
to O
potentially O
get O
you O
through O
the O
4 O
month O
wait O
for O
FMLA O
. O

That O
is O
great O
to O
hear O
about O
Marriott O
, O
thanks O
. O
When O
a O
3* O
has O
a O
hot O

and O
I O
can O
get O
bacon O

eggs O
or O
a O
veggie O
omelet O
made O

I O
m O
fine O

When O

it O

diabetic-friendly B-DIS
looking O
at O

Hampton O

and O
I O
just O
get O
coffee O
. O
A O
healthy O
low-carb O
option O
in O
among O
the O

would O
be O
really O

In O

, O
even O
modest O

I O
was O
at O
a O
4* O
Bay O

Hyatt O
awhile O
ago O
where O
the O
continental O
buffet O
was O
lavish O
but O
totally O
T2-unfriendly B-DIS
and O
the O
hot O
options O
required O
some O
insane O
upcharge O
, O
so O
I O
went O
hungry O
. O

this O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
looking O
all O
over O
this O
subReddit O
waiting O
for O
someone O
to O
mention O
the O
obvious O
. O
Nausea B-DIS
and I-DIS
upset I-DIS
stomach I-DIS
are O
two O
of O
the O
biggest O
things O
that O
s O
marijuana B-DRUG
is O
known O
to O
help O
. O
My O
bf O
has O
debilitating B-DIS
GP I-DIS
and O
CBD B-DRUG
oils I-DRUG
are O
by O
FAR O
the O
best O
medicine O
prescribed O
or O
not O
that O
he O
s O
taken O
. O
Granted O
his O
is O
quite O
awful O
and O
he O
still O
gets O
sick O
3-4 O
times O
a O
week O
, O
but O
that O
s O
cut O
down O
from O
literally O
every O
meal O
with O
the O
prescription O
meds O
. O

gt O
; O
the O
last O
measurement O
was O
with O
35 O
hours O
of O
fasting O
. O
why O
were O
you O
fasting O
for O
so O
long O
The O
blood O
lab O
I O
use O
won O
t O
do O
a O
fasting O
bg O
after O
about O
14 O
hours O
because O
they O
say O
the O
result O
won O
t O
be O
accurate O
. O
but O
yes O
, O
having O
a O
small O
elevation O
with O
fasting O
bg O
and O
a O
normal O
a1c O
isn O
t O
unusual O
with O
prediabetes B-DIS
. O

Yes O
, O
but O
I O
m O
not O
really O
sure O
why O
. O
I O
stopped O
taking O
B12 B-DRUG
and O
that O
helped O
. O
Dr O
doesn O
t O
think O
it O
has O
anything O
to O
do O
with O
each O
other O
, O
but O
that O
s O
the O
2nd O
time O
I O
ve O
stopped O
B12 B-DRUG
supplements I-DRUG
because O
of O
adverse O
reactions O
. O
I O
suspect O
I O
ve O
been O
toxic O
from O
living O
in O
moldy O
houses O
for O
several O
years O
as O
well O
, O
dizziness B-DIS
greatly O
reduced O
when O
moved O
out O

I O
also O
have O
an O
extremely B-DIS
sensitive I-DIS
vagus I-DIS

Dizzy B-DIS
when I-DIS
too I-DIS
hot I-DIS
, O
heart B-DIS
rate I-DIS
high I-DIS
, O
environmental B-DIS
triggers I-DIS
. O
Leads O
to O
fainting B-DIS

Treatment O
is O
eating O
a O

of O
salt O

Keeping O
stable O
electrolytes O
is O
very O
important O
... O
salt O
, O
water O
, O
potassium B-DRUG
, O

So O
many O
possible O
factors O
, O
still O

nothing O

Agree O

Death O
is O
way O
down O
on O
my O
list O
of O
shit O
to O
be O
afraid O
of O
. O
For O
nearly O
3 O
years O
I O
ve O
been O
dealing O
with O
the O
DLB B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
and O
every O
day O
scares O
me O
. O

I O
am O
. O
I O
actually O
don O
t O
usually O
have O
especially O
heavy B-DIS
periods I-DIS
. O
I O
did O
have O
irregular O
ones O
for O
a O
very O
long O
time O
, O
though O
. O
It O
s O
regular O
now O
that O
I O
m O
using O
BC B-DRUG
. O
The O
low B-DIS
Vitamin I-DIS
D I-DIS
wasn O
t O
my O
biggest O
concern O
. O
One O
of O
my O
doctors O
saw O
that O
and O
just O
said O
Yeah O
, O
this O
is O
the O
Northeast O
, O
everyone O
s O
at O
least O
a O
little O
Vitamin B-DIS
D I-DIS
deficient I-DIS
. O
I O
hit O
basically O
every O
one O
of O
those O
points O
except O
dark O
skin O
- O
I O
m O
pale B-DIS
as O
a O
ghost O
, O
which O
is O
why O
I O
wear O
so O
much O
sunscreen O
and O
long O
sleeve O
shirts O
and O
pants O
even O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
summer O
I O
haven O
t O
talked O
to O
my O
PCP O
about O
it O
yet O
. O
He O
was O
bought O
out O
by O
another O
practice O
recently O
, O
so O
it O
s O
been O
really O
hard O
to O
get O
in O
for O
appointments O
. O
I O
ll O
definitely O
have O
to O
bring O
it O
up O
with O
him O
, O
though O

I O
was O
put O
on O
it O
a O
month O
ago O
, O
or O
, O
I O
should O
say O
I O
started O
it O
a O
month O
ago O
. O
I O
had O
to O
fight O
with O
the O
insurance O
company O
and O
specialty O
pharmacy O
for O
about O
3 O
weeks O
to O
get O
it O
filled O
. O
I O
was O
put O
on O
it O
because O
Enbrel B-DRUG
did O
very O
little O
, O
and O
Humira B-DRUG
stopped O
working O
after O
a O
cortisone B-DRUG
shot I-DRUG
for O
a O
bad B-DIS
rotator I-DIS
cuff I-DIS
. O
In O
the O
month O
I O
have O
been O
on O
it O
my O
psoriasis B-DIS
and O
psoriatic B-DIS
arthritis I-DIS
are O
definitely O
much O
better O
. O

I O
m O
actually O
a O
girl O
, O
haha O
. O
No O
biggie O
. O
Honestly O
mine O
have O
been O
back O
and O
forth O
. O
I O
m O
almost O
always O
D O
and O
go O
to O
the O
bathroom O
4 O
times O
a O
day O
but O
lately O
it O
switches O
between O
that O
and O
going O
2-3 O
days O
without O
a O
BM O
. O
Bloating B-DIS
is O
really O
bad O
and O
I O
m O
just O
worried O
I O
m O
going O
to O
have O
to O
be O
on O
a O
really O
strict O
diet O
to O
see O
improvement O

I O
had O
a O
sales O
job O
where O
I O
was O
a O
representative O
from O
an O
outside O
vendor O
working O
in O
retail O
stores O
. O
You O
know O
the O
people O
walking O
around O
the O
warehouse O
clubs O
telling O
you O
about O
cabinet O
refacing O
That O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O
But O
I O
didn O
t O
walk O
around O
, O
I O
would O
set O
up O
a O
table O
with O
brochures O
and O
information O
and O
sit O
there O
. O
It O
was O
a O
great O
college O
job O
because O
they O
weren O
t O
relying O
on O
me O
to O
be O
a O
certain O
place O
at O
a O
certain O
time O
on O
any O
kind O
of O
regular O
basis O
. O
So O
I O
told O
them O
when O
I O
could O
work O
wanted O
to O
work O
and O
got O
good O
hourly O
money O
plus O
commissions O
. O
The O
hourly O
money O
alone O
made O
it O
worth O
the O
work O
. O
I O
averaged O
18ish O
an O
hour O
and O
that O
was O
quite O
a O
while O
ago O
. O
As O
an O
outside O
vendor O
no O
one O
at O
the O
store O
was O
my O
boss O
which O
was O
good O
too O
. O

Thanks O
man O
I O
hope O
you O
re O
right O
. O
I O
will O
just O
have O
to O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
it O
. O

I O
m O
the O
same O
as O
you O
. O
I O
also O
take O
Magnesium B-DRUG
and I-DRUG
B6 I-DRUG
, O
I O
had O
my O
first O
stone B-DIS
in O
2006 O
and O
had O
my O
second O
in O
2016 O
. O
I O
was O
really O
slacking O
on O
taking O
my O
Magnesium B-DRUG
and O
B6 B-DRUG
in O
2015 O
amp O
; O
2016 O
and O
I O
paid O
for O
it O
with O
surgery O

Thanks O

Also O
the O

No O
relationship O
or O
anything O
else O
for O
that O
matter O
can O
be O
perfect O
, O
but O
you O
must O
set O
boundaries O
on O
what O
is O
acceptable O
for O
you O
, O
as O
well O
as O
what O
is O
a O
deal-breaker O
. O
Ultimately O
your O
health O
must O
come O
first O
. O
At O
23 O
and O
25 O
, O
I O
would O
not O
say O
you O
are O
hormonal O
. O
I O
would O
say O
you O
are O
just O
going O
through O
some O
emotionally O
loaded O
problems O
at O
the O
moment O
. O
It O
s O
incredibly O
normal O
to O
have O
sex O
daily O
, O
even O
multiple O
times O
a O
day O
, O
when O
the O
two O
of O
you O
are O
healthy O
and O
still O
in O
the O
early O
limerance O
of O
a O
relationship O
, O
however O
as O
with O
all O
relationships O
spanning O
over O
a O
number O
of O
years O
, O
your O
lifestyle O
will O
change O
and O
then O
life O
gets O
in O
the O
way O
as O
well O
as O
familiarity O
which O
will O
inevitably O
change O
your O
sexual O
habits O
. O
If O
your O
libido O
was O
compatible O
with O
his O
in O
the O
beginning O
, O
that O
would O
have O
simply O
masked O
his O
own O
problems O
and O
expectations O
of O
his O
partner O
you O
, O
and O
those O
problems O
are O
now O
coming O
out O
into O
the O
open O
. O
Difficult O
situations O
like O
IC B-DIS
and O
other O
health O
or O
legal O
financial O
troubles O
, O
kids O
, O
etc O
can O
be O
heavy O
personal O
tests O
for O
both O
parties O
and O
show O
whether O
the O
other O
person O
is O
ready O
to O
change O
, O
or O
is O
resistant O
. O
It O
also O
shows O
the O
baggage O
and O
values O
that O
they O
bring O
into O
the O
relationship O
- O
the O
values O
are O
fluid O
, O
but O
the O
baggage O
usually O
isn O
t. O
The O
responsibility O
is O
now O
in O
your O
hands O
to O
manage O
the O
situation O
and O
educate O
him O
on O
the O
most O
important O
piece O
of O
the O
puzzle O
, O
which O
is O
you O
. O
If O
he O
can O
t O
deal O
with O
that O
, O
then O
the O
answer O
and O
best O
solution O
is O
clear O
. O
Intimacy O
is O
not O
something O
IC B-DIS
affects O
if O
you O
feel O
safe O
communicating O
your O
condition O
to O
him O
. O
By O
intimacy O
, O
I O
mean O

talking O
in O
a O
way O
that O
shows O
the O
shared O
knowledge O
the O
two O
of O
you O
have O
for O
example O
the O
in-jokes O
all O
couples O
create O
or O
discussing O
your O
personal O
lives O
, O
pasts O
, O
wants O
, O
desires O
, O
or O
delving O
deep O
into O
loaded O
topics O
you O
are O
passionate O
about O
. O
It O
is O
also O
physical O
affection O
which O
shows O
vulnerability O
and O
comfort O
with O
one O
another O
. O
It O
s O
also O
talking O
about O
sex O
analytically O
- O
knowing O
each O
others O
past O
for O
example O
. O
Intimacy O
can O
be O
brought O
into O
sex O
, O
but O
sex O
itself O
is O
not O
intimacy O
, O
which O
is O
what O
I O
try O
to O
highlight O
when O
speaking O
about O
these O
topics O
. O
Both O
are O
sources O
of O
recreation O
and O
if O
used O
correctly O
, O
sources O
of O
pleasure O
, O
but O
neither O
should O
be O
used O
as O
a O
bargaining O
tool O
or O
force O
, O
blackmail O
or O
coercion O
. O
Romantic O
relationships O
are O
about O
having O
a O
good O
time O
- O
when O
they O
stop O
being O
about O
that O
and O
that O
symmetry O
is O
lost O
, O
then O
they O
are O
no O
longer O
romantic O
relationships O
, O
but O
codependency O
. O
Love O
and O
dependency O
even O
emotional O
dependency O
are O
different O
things O
. O
As O
far O
as O
sex O
is O
concerned O
, O
if O
orgasm O
alone O
doesn O
t O
set O
off O
PFD B-DIS
or O
other O
symptoms O
for O
you O
, O
then O
oral O
and O
manual O
sex O
are O
both O
very O
acceptable O
alternatives O
to O
penetrative O
sex O
, O
as O
somebody O
else O
mentioned O
. O
I O
would O
suggest O
being O
firm O
with O
him O
and O
stressing O
to O
him O
that O
for O
a O
while O
, O
you O
will O
be O
the O
one O
to O
initiate O
it O
- O
and O
it O
will O
be O
entirely O
on O
your O
terms O
until O
you O
can O
figure O
out O
the O
balance O
. O
That O
is O
not O
unreasonable O
. O
His O
expectations O
need O
to O
be O
controlled O
and O
if O
anything O
, O
he O
should O
not O
value O
your O
high O
libido O
solely O
in O
ways O
that O
serve O
him O
to O
start O
with O
. O
It O
s O
a O
property O
of O
you O
. O
It O
is O
not O
a O
property O
he O
owns O
. O

You O
also O
need O
a O
sex O
life O
with O
yourself O
outside O
of O
the O
relationship O
and O
he O
should O
give O
you O
the O
space O
to O
maintain O
that O
- O
it O
s O
also O
key O
in O
figuring O
out O
how O
to O
work O
around O
IC B-DIS
and O
what O
you O
can O
truly O
still O
enjoy O
, O
what O
you O
must O
modify O
and O
what O
you O
must O
avoid O
, O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
having O
a O
good O
time O
within O
the O
relationship O
and O
in O
the O
future O
of O
your O
sex O
life O
with O
others O
. O
I O
truly O
believe O
when O
I O
say O
that O
these O
adversities O
can O
make O
us O
stronger O
and O
more O
psychologically O
resilient O
than O
the O
general O
population O
, O
because O
we O
need O
to O
sort O
our O
shit O
out O
stat O
and O
the O
pain O
itself O
can O
make O
us O
face O
uncomfortable O
realities O
about O
our O
often O
irrational O
notions O
of O
what O
is O
fairness O
is O
. O
We O
can O
t O
keep O
putting O
it O
off O
like O
we O
used O
to O
before O
IC B-DIS
and O
other O
chronic O
health O
conditions O
arrived O
into O
the O
picture O
. O
Unfortunately O
part O
of O
that O
for O
many O
has O
been O
to O
uncover O
many O
gender O
based O
political O
and O
social O
inequalities O
, O
but O
unless O
we O
speak O
of O
the O
elephant O
in O
the O
room O
, O
there O
s O
no O
way O
to O
make O
it O
leave O
. O
Waiting O
around O
for O
it O
to O
die O
on O
its O
own O
isn O
t O
always O
going O
to O
result O
in O
you O
making O
the O
most O
out O
of O
your O
life O
and O
enjoying O
as O
much O
of O
it O
as O
you O
can O
. O
This O
requires O
proactivity O
and O
doing O
what O
it O
takes O
to O
achieve O
what O
you O
need O
to O
achieve O
, O
rather O
than O
submitting O
to O
external O
pressures O
without O
trying O
to O
change O
them O
first O
. O

Its O
different O
for O
everyone O
, O
but O
worth O
a O
shot O
at O
least O
once O
. O
I O
ve O
found O
that O
when O
I O
m O
in O
a O
bad O
flare-up B-DIS
, O
masturbation O
with O
ONLY O
clitorus O
stimulation O
helps O
temporarily O
to O
ease O
the O
pain B-DIS
. O
It O
seems O
to O
relax O
my O
vaginal O
muscles O
and O
cause O
them O
to O
stop O
contracting O
for O
a O
little O
window O
of O
relief O
. O

I O
was O
thinking O
that O
. O
I O
m O
trying O
to O
get O
in O
to O
see O
an O
OT O
at O
the O
moment O
, O
so O
maybe O
it O
is O
worth O
waiting O
That O
s O
a O
really O
good O
tip O
. O
Thankyou O

Ironically O
im O
setting O
up O
sinus O
work O
too O
. O
I O
saw O
an O
ENT O
3 O
years O
ago O
due O
to O
eye B-DIS
pain I-DIS
with O
no O
actual O
eye O
issues O
, O
cleared O
by O
eye O
doctor O
and O
sinus B-DIS
issues I-DIS
related O
to O
flying O
and O
was O
told O
I O
have O
multiple O
issues O
that O
needed O
to O
be O
addressed O
, O
including O
polyps B-DIS
and O
a O
deviated B-DIS
septum I-DIS
. O
I O
never O
got O
the O
surgery O
, O
but O
I O
am O
seeing O
that O
Doc O
again O
next O
week O
to O
start O
things O
over O
. O
Due O
to O
sinus B-DIS
issues I-DIS
, O
I O
need O
a O
full O
face O
mask O
. O
I O
am O
thinking O
a O
trying O
a O
Quattro B-DRUG
FX I-DRUG
. O
It O
seems O
to O
be O
well O
received O
and O
its O
smaller O
should O
be O
easier O
to O
adapt O
to O
. O
I O
also O
have O
sensitive B-DIS
skin I-DIS
, O
so O
hopefully O
it O
works O
. O
I O
may O
need O
to O
go O
to O
a O
cloth O
mask O
though O
. O

Alright O
thanks O
, O
what O
s O
the O
treatment O
for O

more O
than O
one O
over O

I O
suggest O
maybe O
going O
for O
a O
walk O
and O
exploring O
. O
I O
was O
in O
the O
hospital O
last O
week O
and O
discovered O
a O
room O
where O
the O
long O
wall O
was O
entirely O

Spent O
my O
boring O
days O
watching O
people O
drive O

They O
are O
still O

we O

we O

In O

The O
camera O
keeps O
a O
video O
journal O
of O
when O
the O
mailman O
came O
and O
when O
my O
father-in-law O
left O
home O
for O
a O
walk O
. O
That O
day O
, O
I O
left O
home O
to O
pick O
up O
my O
kids O
from O
school O
. O
The O
ride O
was O
only O
10 O
minutes O
. O
When O
we O
arrived O
home O
, O
we O
smelt O
something O
unpleasant O
and O
disturbing O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
see O
anything O
suspicious O
, O
so O
I O
opened O
the O
app O
and O
checked O
motion O
detection O
videos O
. O
I O
saw O
my O
father-in-law O
in O
the O
hallway O
, O
dropped O
his O
pants O
, O
and O
literally O
squatted O
down O
, O
and O
defecated B-DIS
and I-DIS
urinated I-DIS
right I-DIS
on I-DIS
the I-DIS
floor I-DIS
. O
Then O
he O
grabbed O
feces O
into O
his O
hands O
and O
threw O
away O
into O
the O
trash O
can O
. O
After O
doing O
it O
, O
he O
simply O
walked O
away O
as O
nothing O
happened O
. O
He O
didn O
t O
tell O
anything O
about O
it O
to O
me O
as O
well O
. O
I O
was O
flooded O
with O
too O
many O
emotions O
disgust O
, O
I O
have O
to O
admit O
, O
as O
well O
as O
frustration O
and O
curiosity O
. O
Is O
this O
the O
first O
time O
Who O
even O
knows O
I O
told O
my O
husband O
about O
this O
that O
evening O
. O
He O
thought O
his O
dad O
was O
probably O
incontinent B-DIS
, O
like O
the O
scene O
where O
Julianne O
Moore O
s O
character O
couldn O
t O
find O
the O
washroom O
and O
peed O
on O
herself O
in O
the O
movie O
Still O
Alice O
. O
Reluctantly O
because O
I O
know O
how O
devastating O
it O
can O
be O
for O
him O
, O

I O
showed O
him O
the O
recording O
. O
I O
could O
see O
that O
he O
was O
trying O
to O
hold O
his O
tears O
when O
he O
said O
Sorry O
, O
you O
weren O
t O
exaggerating O
. O
We O
ll O
take O
him O
to O
dementia B-DIS
assessment O
. O
I O
think O
observation O
and O
early O
identification O
is O
really O
important O
. O
Hope O
my O
story O
helps O
. O

Isn O
t O
high B-DIS

a O
factor O
for O
calcium B-DIS
oxalate I-DIS

too O
Crystal O
Light O
, O
the O

, O
has O
a O
fair O
bit O

content O
. O
Seems O
like O
a O
trade O
off O
. O

Yeah O
I O
think O
any O
improvement O
at O
this O
point O
would O
be O
awesome O
. O
It O
sucks O
knowing O
how O
you O
used O
to O
feel O
vs O
how O
you O
feel O
now O
. O

Interesting O
fact O
beano B-DRUG
enzyme I-DRUG
is O
the O
same O
enzyme O
released O
by O
Aspergillus O
oryzae O
, O
the O
mold O
used O
to O
make O
sake O
and O
miso O
. O
It O
breaks O
the O
starch O
in O
the O
rice O
soybean O
down O
to O
fermentable O
sugars O
. O
The O
enzyme O
is O
also O
used O
to O
make O
hfcs O
from O
corn O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
if O
there O
s O
ever O
been O
any O
research O
but O
I O
ve O
always O
supposed O
that O
comsuming O
raw O
miso O
sake O
would O
be O
full O
of O
enzymes O
. O
It O
s O
also O
in O
traditional O
soysauce O
but O
soysauce O
in O
the O
u.s. O
is O
not O
fermented O
but O
produced O
more O
like O
hfcs O
. O

That O
s O
actually O
incredibly O
helpful O
. O
Thank O
you O

The O
process O
of O
getting O
my O
stent O
out O
was O
miserable O
lol O

never O
hurt O
, O
but O
sitting O
in O

all O
lubed O
up O

with O
an O
alien-like O
contraption O
being O
shoved O

somethign O
you O
ll O
never O
forget O
. O
Feeling O
the O
scope O
go O
through O
me O
, O
and O
the O
pressure B-DIS
, O
was O
terrible O
. O
Afterwards O
I O
felt O
great O
, O
but O
as O
soon O
as O
I O
had O
my O
first O
piss O
post O
stent O
removal O
, O
it O
was O
rough O
. O

How O
do O
you O
know O
that O
your O
thyroid B-DIS
is O
the O
source O
of O
your O
problems O
Have O
you O
had O
other O
things O
checked O
out O
Is O
your O
B12 O
at O
least O
500 O
Are O
your O
iron O
and O
ferritin B-DIS
at O
least O
mid-range O
Is O
your O
vitamin O
D O
normal O
Low B-DIS
iron I-DIS
ferritin B-DIS
or I-DIS
low I-DIS
B12 I-DIS
can O
both O
cause O
symptoms O
that O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
thyroid B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
. O
Also O
have O
you O
been O
checked O
for O
allergies B-DIS
What O
about O
for O
celiac B-DIS

So O
we O
still O
should O
take O
it O
even O
with O
the O

Jerky O
I O
like O
turkey O
jerky O
, O
and O
it O
has O
a O
tiny O
amount O
of O
carbs O
. O
I O
eat O
it O
at O
my O
desk O
if O
I O
want O
something O
with O
no O
carbs O
. O
I O
just O
made O
fathead O
pizza O
last O
night O
for O
the O
first O
time O
and O
it O
was O
AMAZING O
. O
It O
has O
carbs O
, O
BUT O
you O
could O
take O
just O
the O
dough O
and O
make O
some O
sort O
of O
cracker O
out O
of O
it O
, O
and O
dip O
in O
something O
. O
I O
thought O
the O
dough O
would O
be O
delicious O
with O
garlic O
sprinkled O
on O
it O
, O
and O
maybe O
brushed O
with O
melted O
butter O
. O
Or O
sprinkle O
some O
cheese O
and O
bake O
it O
. O
I O
know O
you O
say O
you O
re O
over O
cheese O
, O
but O
some O
cheeses O
are O
not O
as O
bothersome O
as O
others O
, O
like O
mozarella O
for O
me O
. O
I O
don O
t O
have O
an O
issue O
with O
that O
or O
Babybel O
cheeses O
which O
are O
super O
convenient O
. O

Oh O
yeah O
. O
The O
free O
vests O
from O
MS B-DIS
society O
or O
cheap O
elsewhere O
aren O
t O
that O
great O
if O
you O
re O
in O
a O
humid O

. O
I O
ve O
been O
thinking O
about O
upgrading O

That O
must O
be O

why O

I O
asked O
my O

if O

all O

said O
I O
could O
take O
it O

All O
at O
once O

spread O
out O

it O
doesn O

I O
just O
take O
it O
all O
in O
the O

that O
I O
won O
t O
forget O

multiple O

figured O
I O
d O
just O
take O
the O
next O

so O
good O

Ultimately O
, O
I O
just O
took O
one O

in O

that O
was O
the O

seemed O
to O

feeling O
briefly O

ended O
up O

can O

was O
definitely O
stressing O

d O
never O
missed O

m O
still O
newly O

probably O
2 O

I O
appreciate O

can O

basically O
you O

any O
possible O
reduced B-DIS

function I-DIS
. O
It O
should O
be O
fine O
, O
but O
6 O
months O
is O
a O
long O
time O
for O
your O
kidney O
to O
nap O
. O

yes O
maybe O
so O
. O
i O
am O
just O
really O
self O
aware O
and O
and O
always O
think O
people O
can O
tell O
i O
had O
a O
sluggy B-DIS
bowel I-DIS
movement I-DIS
. O
wet O

can O
give O
you O
a O
sense O
of O
reassurance O
and O
comfort O
; O
that O
everything O
is O
fresh O
and O
as O
clean O
as O
a O
shower O
. O
i O
heavily O
recommend O
you O
to O
keep O
some O
in O
your O
bag O
purse O
. O
i O
use O
water O
wipes O
from O
amazon O
. O
they O
are O
not O
expensive O
and O
only O
have O
water O
with O
a O
dash O
of O
citrus O
. O
no O
chems O
or O
anything O
that O
gives O
allergies O
. O
so O
they O
re O
good O
for O
all O
areas O
. O

I O
swim O
. O
Few O
times O

read O
that O

appreciate O

makes O
this O
seem O
less O
bizarre O

am O

proud O

what O
you O

a O

casts O

that O
on O

any O

doubt O

sucks O

also O
realize O
those O

don O

don O

if O

the O

I O
guess O
a O

that O
I O
no O

Shit O

it O

. O
Like O
I O
ve O
said O
DBS O
isn O
t O
for O
everyone O
, O
but O
for O
me O
it O
made O
a O
hell O
of O
a O
difference O
. O
Just O
wondering O
if O
my O
PD B-DIS
is O
really O
LBD B-DIS
or O
PDD B-DIS
. O

Why O
are O
you O
on O
prednisone B-DRUG
I O
ve O
been O
looking O
into O
the O
mthfr B-DIS
gene I-DIS
mutations I-DIS
and O
it O
seems O
interesting O
. O
Thinking O
about O
doing O
the O
23 O
and O
me O
genetic O
testing O
. O
I O
started O
taking O
a O
B B-DRUG
Complex I-DRUG
with I-DRUG
methylated I-DRUG
folate I-DRUG
about O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
it O
does O
seem O
to O
help O
a O
little O
. O
I O
can O
t O
even O
remember O
what O
exactly O
it O
was O
now O
but O
I O
think O
it O
was O
the O
number B-DIS
of I-DIS
red I-DIS
blood I-DIS
cells I-DIS
was I-DIS
always I-DIS
low I-DIS
. O
Is O
that O
the O
one O
that O
signals O
folate B-DIS
deficiency I-DIS
My O
brain O
no O
works O
good O
today.. O

I O
m O
feeling O
a O
lot O
better O
. O
I O
feel O
like O
I O
completely O
lost O
the O
month O
of O
April O
though O
. O
It O
was O
crazy O
, O
I O
ve O
never O
been O
that O
sick B-DIS
before O
. O
Not O
only O
did O
I O
have O
the O
kidney B-DIS
infection I-DIS
but O
I O
had O
an O
emergency O
root B-DIS
canal I-DIS
; O
two B-DIS
major I-DIS
fillings I-DIS
; O
and O
the O
last O
molar O
on O
the O
upper O
left O
pulled O
due O
to O
infection B-DIS
. O
Oh O
, O
and O
strep B-DIS
throat I-DIS
. O
I O
m O
still O
not O
100 O
but O
doing O
a O
lot O
better O
. O
It O
took O
a O
solid O
7 O
days O
of O
antibiotics B-DRUG
before O
I O
started O
to O
feel O
a O
bit O
better O
from O
the O
kidney B-DIS
infection I-DIS
and O
had O
another O
7 O
days O
of O
antibiotics B-DRUG
for O
that O
. O
Then O
BLAM O
gt O
; O
dental B-DIS
abscess I-DIS
So O
I O
had O
to O
go O
on O
antibiotics B-DRUG
again O
. O
That O
s O
a O
total O
of O
14 O
consecutive O
days O
on O
the O
strong O
antibiotic B-DRUG
for O
my O
kidney B-DIS
infection I-DIS
; O
and O
2 O
rounds O
of O
7 O
days O
on O
Amoxicillin B-DRUG
for O
my O
teeth O
in O
a O
period O
of O
5 O
weeks O
. O
All O
of O
the O
doctors O
and O
my O
dentist O
couldn O
t O
tell O
if O
the O
infection B-DIS
was O
systemic O
from O
my O
teeth O
but O
I O
think O
it O
was O
. O
Once O
the O
tooth O
was O
pulled O
a O
week O
ago O
Monday O
I O
started O
to O
feel O
better O
than O
I O
have O
in O
a O
while O
. O
Oh O
and O
on O
top O
of O
it O
all O
when O
I O
had O
the O
root O
canal O
my O
dentist O
was O
on O
vacation O
. O
So O
I O
went O
to O
his O
on O
call O
Dentist O
. O
She O
fixed O
me O
up O
and O
asked O
me O
if O
any O
other O
teeth O
were O
bothering O
me O
. O
I O
had O
been O
having O
dental B-DIS
pain I-DIS
for O
a O
long O
time O
so O
I O
told O
her O
about O
it O
. O
I O
had O
seen O
my O
old O
dentist O
frequently O
and O
when O
I O
d O
tell O
him O
I O
was O
in O
pain B-DIS
he O
d O
say O
that O
it O
wasn O
t O
that O
bad O
and O
there O
was O
no O
point O
in O
drilling O
if O

he O
didn O
t O
have O
to O
. O
So O
the O
new O
dentist O
took O
a O
bunch O
of O
X-rays O
and O
it O
turns O
out O
that O
I O
need O
about O
12000 O
worth O
of O
dental O
work O
. O
I O
have O
cavities B-DIS
in O
every O
single O
tooth O
. O
I O
was O
shocked O
. O
I O
have O
to O
report O
him O
for O
negligence O
. O
The O
upper O
left O
side O
is O
done O
and O
now O
I O
move O
on O
to O
the O
next O
quadrant O
of O
my O
mouth O
. O
It O
s O
been O
pretty O
rough O
but O
I O
m O
hanging O
in O
there O
. O
I O
have O
an O
appointment O
with O
my O
urologist O
next O
week O
thank O
god O
and O
I O
ll O
find O
out O
if O
he O
will O
do O
lithotripsy O
. O
I O
am O
still O
having O
pain O
in O
my O
kidney O
s O
and O
mild B-DIS
renal I-DIS
colic I-DIS
. O
So O
yeah O
... O
very O
long O
story O
short O
I O
am O
feeling O
better O
. O
Lol O
Sorry O
for O
the O
novel O
I O
just O
wrote O
. O
It O
s O
just O
been O
so O
insane O
. O
I O
still O
can O
t O
believe O
the O
whole O
thing O
. O
How O
are O
you O
doing O
Edit O
spacing O
Edit O
added O
a O
sentence O

All O
the O
time O
. O
My O
cousin O
s O
wife O
s O
dentist O
s O
dog O
walker O
had O
that O
and O
she O
took O
a O
bath O
in O
chamomile O
tea O
and O
it O
cleared O
right O
up O
It O
used O
to O
really O
piss O
me O
off O
but O
I O
think O
you O
re O
right O
about O
people O
just O
trying O
to O
deal O
with O
the O
awkwardness O
, O
and O
I O
usually O
tell O
myself O
they O
re O
just O
being O
compassionate O
. O

gt O
; O
And O
since O
I O
know O
you O
like O
science O
Cheeky O
; O

I O
use O
the O
My O
RA B-DIS
app O
on O
my O
phone O
. O
It O
tracks O
my O
meds O
and O
they O
have O
a O
picture O
of O
a O
person O
and O
you O
tap O
on O
the O
joints B-DIS
that I-DIS
are I-DIS
bugging I-DIS
you I-DIS
and O
indicate O
how O
severe O
the O
pain B-DIS
is O
. O
It O
also O
sets O
a O
daily O
reminder O
to O
track O
your O
sumptoms O
. O

i O
just O
got O
this O
stuff O
two O
weeks O
ago.. O
i O
used O
it O
one O
time O
on O
my O
scalp O
once.. O
its O
working O
rather O
well O
if O
i O
do O
say O
so O
myself O
. O
at O
least O
on O
my O
older O
flare B-DIS
up I-DIS
spots I-DIS
... O

The O
last O
time O
I O
had O
a O
bad O
episode O
I O
decided O
to O
learn O
about O
cricket O
, O
so O
I O
got O
a O
free O
trial O
to O
a O
cricket O
channel O
. O
It O
s O
kind O
of O
ideal O
for O
that O
kind O
of O
situation O
- O
it O
s O
mellow O
, O
you O
can O
tune O
it O
out O
or O
concentrate O
on O
it O
as O
you O
like O
and O
still O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
up O
with O
things O
, O
there O
s O
lots O
of O
little O
details O
to O
learn O
, O
and O
the O
games O
go O
on O
forever O
. O

I O
ve O
had O
one O
root B-DIS
canal I-DIS
with O
a O
ceramic O
crown O
put O
over O
it O
so O
at O
least O
it O
looks O
normal O
. O
Im O
with O
you O
, O
legit O
concern O
. O
The O
vomiting B-DIS
becomes O
second O
nature O
and O
I O
can O
cope O
with O
it O
, O
but O
to O
lose B-DIS
teeth I-DIS
... O
If O
i O
get O
any O
sensitivity B-DIS
I O
start O
thinking O
the O
worst O
. O
Hope O
everything O
is O
ok O
long O
term O
with O
your O
teeth O
. O

You O
always O
have O
calcium O
in O
your O
body O
, O
you O
need O
it O
for O
bones O
. O
I O
would O
still O
lean O
towards O
calcium B-DRUG
oxalate I-DRUG
until O
you O
know O
for O
sure O
, O
especially O
since O
you O
are O
a O
vegetarian O
. O
Drink O
lots O
of O
water O
and O
try O
to O
put O
some O
lemon O
juice O
in O
your O
water O
. O
It O
can O
t O
hurt O
you O
and O
it O
will O
help O
if O
your O
stones B-DIS
actually O
are O
calcium O
oxalate O
. O

Some O
people O
that O
suffer O
from O
BFS B-DIS
have O
severe B-DIS
twitching I-DIS
and O
some O
might O
expirience O
just O
a O
few O
per O
minute O
. O
I O
suggest O
you O
go O
read O
up O
on O
some O
info O
BFS B-DIS
forums O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
share O
their O
take O
on O
the O
syndrome O
. O
Could O
you O
elaborate O
on O
how O
the O
numbness B-DIS
presents O
itself O
in O
your O
case O

Pallidotomy O
and O
Thalamotomy O
are O
two O
types O
of O
ablative O
brain O
surgery O
. O
Historically O
this O
was O
either O
a O
scalpel O
1930 O
s O
or O
using O
an O
electronic O
scalpel O
heated O
element O
to O
perform O
the O
cut O
in O
the O
brain O
to O
help O
with O
movement B-DIS
disorders I-DIS
. O
You O
need O
to O
cut O
a O
hole O
into O
the O
skull O
, O
then O
insert O
the O
scalpel O
to O
perform O
the O
cuts O
. O
The O
focused O
ultrasonic O
is O
still O
ablative O
brain O
surgery O
, O
but O
can O
be O
done O
without O
having O
to O
cut O
a O
hole O
into O
the O
skull O
. O
No O
chance O
of O
infection B-DIS
, O
but O
remember O
once O
the O
cut O
is O
done O
there O
is O
no O
recourse O
. O
So O
there O
isn O
t O
any O
chance O
of O
changing O
the O
outcome O
. O
DBS O
deep O
brain O
stimulation O
does O
allow O
for O
electrodes O
to O
be O
removed O
in O
the O
future O
. O
So O
there O
is O
a O
possibility O
of O
reversal O
if O
not O
successful O
. O
Admitted O
higher O
chance O
of O
infection O
, O
and O
also O
complications O
. O
Focused O
Ultra O
Sound O
cost O
about O
6000 O
for O
the O
surgery O
. O
DBS O
Deep O
Brain O
Surgery O
is O
about O
125,000 O
168,000 O
for O
the O
surgery O
. O
I O
suspect O
we O
will O
see O
insurance O
companies O
pushing O
us O
towards O
Focus O
Ultra O
Sound O
due O
to O
cost O
savings O
. O
So O
do O
your O
research O
before O
committing O
to O
surgery O
. O
Cool O
XRAY O
Showing O
the O
leads O
that O
are O
in O
the O
brain O
a O
friend O
didn O
t O
realize O
how O
deep O
they O
are O
, O
and O
it O
is O
a O
slight O
thalamotomy O
when O
inserting O
the O
leads O
. O

You O
should O
see O
a O
doctor O
who O
is O
board-certified O
in O
sleep O
medicine O
. O
This O
is O
typically O
a O
pulmonologist O
, O
but O
doesn O
t O
need O
to O
be O
. O
Any O
doctor O
can O
order O
a O
sleep O
study O
, O
but O
you O
should O
really O
find O
one O
who O
knows O
what O
they O
re O
doing O
. O

I O
did O
my O
trial O
with O
a O
dreamstation O
and O
amara B-DRUG
view I-DRUG
mask I-DRUG
, O
ended O
up O
buying O
a O
resmed O
airsense O
10 O
with O
a O
f20 O
mask O
, O
wouldnt O
recomend O
the O
f20 O
the O
cushion O
tears O
just O
by O
looking O
at O
it O
But O
anyway O
theres O
a O
pressure O
releif O
on O
exhale O
called O
cflex O
on O
your O
machine O
, O
drops O
up O
to O
3cm O
on O
exhale O
helps O
alot O
I O
also O
turn O
off O
the O
heated O
hose O
cos O
i O
found O
it O
suffocating O
with O
the O
warm O
air O
Had O
the O
same O
probs O
as O
you O
ive O
just O
persevered O
with O
it O
, O
it O
does O
get O
easier O
, O
to O
the O
point O
now O
where O
i O
wouldnt O
sleep O
without O
it O

Hey O
buddy O
, O
you O
ain O
t O
got O
nothin O

t O
seen O
before O
. O
In O
fact O
they O
ve O
probably O
seen O
far O
, O
far O
worse O
. O
They O
re O
just O
people O
doing O
their O
jobs O
. O
If O
they O
worked O
at O
a O
pizza O
place O
, O
you O
re O
another O
can O
of O
tomato O
sauce O
. O
During O
their O
schooling O
they O
saw O
and O
did O
stuff O
that O
would O
make O
your O
stomach O
turn O
every O
day O
. O
There O
s O
really O
nothing O
to O
be O
embarrassed O
about O
. O
Good O
for O
you O
for O
seeing O
a O
professional O
. O
I O
hope O
it O
works O
out O
for O
you O
and O
makes O
you O
feel O
less O
isolated O
. O
And O
if O
it O
helps O
any O
, O
ball B-DIS
flakes I-DIS
are O
the O
worst O
, O
except O
maybe O
when O
you O
get O

That O
shit O

had O
a O
few O

That O

very O
interesting O

That O

be O
somehow O
using O

Since O

the O

Are O

Thanks O
for O
posting O
that O
. O
I O
had O
not O
seen O
it O
before O
. O

You O
re O
welcome O
and O
thank O
you O
for O
your O
kind O
words O
. O
I O
won O
t O
lie O
it O
sucked O
, O
but O
I O
look O
at O
it O
as O
I O
got O
18 O
really O
good O
years O
, O
but O
life O
isn O
t O
horrible O
by O
any O
means O
. O

I O
am O
using O
Triamcinolone B-DRUG
cream I-DRUG
which O
is O
somewhat O
toning O
down O
the O
the O
itching B-DIS
as O
well O
as O
the O
redness B-DIS
on O
my O
face O
, O
toes O
, O
eyebrows O
amp O
; O
genitals O
. O
I O
also O
developed O
severe O
plaques O
on O
my O
back O
around O
my O
surgery O
site O
which O
are O
real O
thick O
and O
scaly O
. O

Mine O
started O
in O
my O
feet O
. O
One O
day O
I O
woke O
up O
and O
noticed O
it O
hurt B-DIS
on I-DIS
both I-DIS
balls I-DIS
of I-DIS
my I-DIS
feet I-DIS
when I-DIS
I I-DIS
walked I-DIS
. O
I O
thought O
, O
hmmm O
, O
maybe O
I O
over O
did O
it O
with O
heels O
. O
So O
I O
wore O
flats O
for O
a O
week O
. O
The O
pain B-DIS
kept I-DIS
getting I-DIS
worse I-DIS
, O
so O
I O
wore O
my O
Nike O
s O
and O
added O
arch O
supports O
. O
A O
few O
weeks O
later O
I O
could O
barely O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
my O
feet B-DIS
hurt I-DIS
so O
much O
to O
stand O
on O
my O
hardwood O
floor O
. O
Around O
this O
time O
my O
hands B-DIS
started I-DIS
to I-DIS
hurt I-DIS
. O
A O
week O
or O
so O
later O
my O
hands B-DIS
started I-DIS
to I-DIS
feel I-DIS
frozen I-DIS
upon I-DIS
waking I-DIS
. O
My O
symptoms O
presented O
themselves O
withing O
6 O
weeks O
, O
and O
after O
blood O
tests O
amp O
; O
x-rays O
I O
was O
diagnosed B-DIS
with I-DIS
RA I-DIS
. O
I O
m O
lucky O
that O
I O
caught O
it O
so O
quickly O
. O
I O
tell O
everyone O
who O
has O
foot B-DIS
pain I-DIS
in I-DIS
both I-DIS
feet I-DIS
to O
get O
checked O
out O
immediately O
Good O
luck O

Keep O
trying O
different O
combinations O
of O
medicines O
until O
you O
find O
which O
work O
for O
you O
. O
Try O
changing O
your O
diet O
, O
vegan O
worked O
for O
me O
, O
low O
fat O
and O
fibre O
helps O
lots O
of O
people O
. O
Keep O
exercising O
, O
I O
personally O
can O
t O
do O
anything O
high O
intensity O
so O
I O
stick O
to O
walking O
, O
swimming O
, O
and O
bouldering O
. O
Look O
after O
your O
mental O
health O
, O
if O
you O
think O
you O
have O
serious O
problems O
see O
a O
therapist O
this O
helped O
a O
lot O
for O
me O
, O
otherwise O
just O
get O
out O
and O
see O
your O
friends O
, O
stay O
active O

Dealing O
with O
a O
chronic O
health O
condition O
is O
so O
much O
easier O
when O
you O
re O
happy O
and O
distracted O
. O
GP B-DIS
can O
take O
a O
long O
time O
to O
get O
on O
top O
of O
, O
stress O
can O
make O
it O
worse O
. O
I O
ended O
up O
taking O
over O
a O
year O
out O
of O
work O
. O
Make O
your O
university O
aware O
of O
the O
issues O
now O
, O
and O
if O
you O
need O
to O
take O
a O
year O
out O
don O
t O
be O
afraid O
to O
do O
it O
. O

Untreated O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
is O
a O
lot O
worse O
than O
most O
people O
think O
, O
and O
people O
need O
to O
understand O
that O
its O
effects O
can O
be O
devastating O
. O
However O
, O
it O
s O
not O
untreatable O
and O
not O
incurable O
, O
so O
in O
general O
I O
don O
t O
think O
it O
s O
fair O
to O
say O
that O
it O
s O
one O
of O
the O
worst O
diseases O
out O
there O
. O

I O
also O
use O
insulin B-DRUG
needles O
, O
a O
box O
of O
like O
100 O
8mm O
needles O
was O
about O
20 O
with O
insurance O
at O
Costco O
. O
I O
don O
t O
like O
auto O
injectors O
of O
any O
kind O
, O
and O
my O
MTX B-DRUG
comes O
in O
a O
vial O
. O
I O
do O
MTX B-DRUG
and O
Enbrel B-DRUG
shots O
once O
a O
week O
. O
The O
first O
few O
times O
are O
a O
little O
emotional O
, O
and O
that O
s O
okay O
. O
Go O
slow O
with O
the O
plunger O
until O
you O
get O
used O
to O
it O
, O
and O
then O
it O
really O
does O
become O
routine O
. O
I O
usually O
give O
myself O
5 O
minutes O
alone O
in O
a O
quiet O
part O
of O
the O
house O
typically O
the O
bathroom O
to O
do O
my O
shots O
, O
typically O
on O
a O
Friday O
evening O
. O
I O
originally O
planned O
this O
so O
that O
A O
I O
could O
sleep O
through O
the O
worst O
of O
the O
potential O
side O
effects O
, O
and O
B O
if O
you O
re O
the O
type O
to O
get O
a O
MTX B-DRUG
hangover O
, O
Saturday O
s O
are O
typically O
less O
taxing O
than O
weekdays O
. O
I O
second O
the O
other O
advice O
in O
letting O
it O
warm O
up O
. O
What O
I O
ll O
usually O
do O
with O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
is O
keep O
it O
in O
the O
fridge O
, O
and O
then O
when O
I O
get O
home O
from O
classes O
work O
on O
Friday O
I O
set O
up O
the O
syringe O
and O
leave O
it O
out O
to O
warm O
up O
for O
a O
couple O
of O
hours O
until O
it O
gets O
to O
room O
temperature O
. O
Doing O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
injections O
with O
a O
small O
insulin B-DRUG
needle O
is O
probably O
the O
biggest O
difference O
you O
can O
make O
in O
making O
the O
injections O
suck O
less O
. O
My O
Enbrel B-DRUG
comes O
in O
an O
inch O
long O
needle O
which O
I O
think O
is O
27mm O
, O
so O
what O
you O
have O
, O
and O
that O
hurts O
but O
only O
for O
a O
few O
seconds O
during O
and O
maybe O
a O
minute O
or O
two O
after O
. O

My O
sister O
in O
law O
went O
into O
remission B-DIS
with O
her O
first O
pregnancy B-DIS
and O
did O
get O
some O
relief O
during O
her O
second O
, O
but O
not O
remission O
. O
It O
came O
back O
with O
a O
vengeance O
shortly O
after O
giving O
birth O
. O
She O
was O
able O
to O
take O
plaquenil B-DRUG
during O
both O
pregnancies O
and O
had O
no O
issues O
, O
but O
had O
to O
stop O
methotrexate B-DRUG
. O

You O
have O
good O
reason O
to O
be O
skeptical O
about O
them O
. O
I O
don O
t O
take O
them O
. O

May O
be O
a O
stupid O
question O
but O
how O
does O
your O
back O
feel O
Do O
you O
get O
pins B-DIS
and I-DIS
needles I-DIS
in I-DIS
your I-DIS
feet I-DIS
and O
is O
one O
foot O
worse O

Oh O
wow O
, O
I O
definitely O
need O
to O
put O
a O
system O
in O
place O
so O
I O
can O
keep O
track O
of O
everything O
. O
Thanks O
for O
sharing O
your O
experience O
. O
It O
s O
wild O
how O
medications O
can O
affect O
everyone O
so O
differently O
. O

These O
are O
all O
good O
ideas O
, O
I O
ve O
been O
checked O
for O
just O
about O
everything O
I O
ve O
had O
a O
colonoscopy O
and O
bloodwork O
, O
my O
current O
nutritional O
program O
had O
me O
cleanse O
a O
couple O
times O
a O
month O
which O
helps O
some O
. O
I O
can O
t O
really O
fast O
very O
well O
, O
I O
was O
anorexic B-DIS
as O
a O
teen O
and O
faint O
if O
my O
blood O
sugar O
drops O

Mine O
started B-DIS
on I-DIS
my I-DIS
scrotum I-DIS
, O
then B-DIS
my I-DIS
back I-DIS
, O
scalp B-DIS
, O
legs B-DIS
, O
knees B-DIS
, O
elbows B-DIS
, O
back B-DIS
of I-DIS
ears I-DIS
, O
groin B-DIS
, O
fingers B-DIS
, O
and B-DIS
belly I-DIS
button I-DIS
. O
My O
belly O
button O
is O
the O
worst O
because O
I O
scratch O
it O
and O
the O
skin O
falls O
out O
and O
just O
burns O
. O

I O
was O
on O
neoral B-DRUG
cyclosporin B-DRUG
for O
a O
little O
while O
before O
I O
started O
MTX B-DRUG
. O
It O
made O
me O
realllllly O
ill O
, O
like O
, O
vomiting B-DIS
most O
days O
not O
just O
nausea B-DIS
. O
It O
did O
clear O
up O
my O
P O
in O
zero O
time O
at O
all O
though O
. O
As O
a O
result O
, O
when O
I O
went O
onto O
MTX B-DRUG
, O
I O
felt O
so O
much O
better O
in O
comparison O
. O
At O
the O
time O
I O
didn O
t O
have O
the O
best O
lifestyle O
, O
bit O
overweight B-DIS
, O
drinking O
eating O
the O
wrong O
things O
etc O
. O
though O
, O
so O
I O
always O
felt O
a O
bit O
meh O
. O
Sluggish B-DIS
etc O
. O
So O
when O
I O
started O
losing O
weight O
intentionally O
and O
living O
more O
healthier O
, O
I O
noticed O
I O
was O
still O
groggy B-DIS
. O
I O
came O
off O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
for O
several O
months O
over O
a O
summer O
period O
in O
2015 O
when O
it O
had O
cleared O
up O
almost O
fully O
. O
When O
I O
restarted O
the O
MTX B-DRUG
I O
noticed O
it O
made O
me O
very B-DIS
groggy I-DIS
and O
similar O
to O
the O
things O
j0npau1 O
has O
said O
. O
I O
had O
muscle B-DIS
ache I-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS
legs I-DIS
a O
lot O
, O
my O
ALT O
levels O
something O
they O
monitor O
from O
the O
liver O
shot O
up O
to O
over O
200 O
should O
be O
under O
20ish O
I O
think O
, O
for O
a O
normal O
adult O
. O
Migraines B-DIS
frequently O
. O
I O
think O
it O
affected B-DIS
my I-DIS
mood I-DIS
a O
little O
too O
but O
this O
is O
hard O
to O
say O
for O
sure O
. O
I O
was O
on O
12.5mg O
once O
a O
week O
. O
I O
came O
off O
it O
towards O
the O
end O
of O
last O
summer O
as O
decided O
it O
wasn O
t O
doing O
my O
body O
any O
favours O
, O
at O
the O
time O
it O
wasn O
t O
too O
bad O
again O
. O
Sadly O
I O
found O
myself O
pregnant O
in O
the O
winter O
, O
despite O
having O
the O
coil O
. O
I O
took O
advice O
and O
although O
it O
wasn O
t O
the O
best O
time O
practically O
anyway O
, O
I O
had O
to O
abort O
at O
an O
early O
stage O
. O
Over O
winter O
and O
at O
the O
start O
of O
this O
year O
lack O
of O

sun O
lack O
of O
meds O
stress O
my O
skin B-DIS
is I-DIS
looking I-DIS
pretty I-DIS
awful I-DIS
again O
. O
I O
go O
to O
the O
gym O
3x O
a O
week O
, O
eat O
super O
healthy O
, O
don O
t O
drink O
, O
and O
lead O
what O
I O
think O
is O
a O
good O
healthy O
lifestyle O
, O
none O
of O
it O
makes O
a O
difference O
. O
I O
m O
starting O
on O
biologics B-DRUG
in O
the O
next O
couple O
of O
weeks O
, O
I O
m O
told O
these O
are O
a O
lot O
more O
targeted O
and O
much O
less O
side O
effects O
. O
I O
really O
don O
t O
mean O
to O
scare O
you O
off O
but O
in O
my O
opinion O
MTX B-DRUG
is O
a O
clusterfuck O
drug O
. O
Its O
weighing O
up O
whether O
you O
want O
to O
have O
the O
clear B-DIS
skin I-DIS
but O
also O
a O
quite O
toxic O
drug O
in O
your O
system O
. O
I O
do O
understand O
both O
sides O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
didn O
t O
mind O
and O
I O
was O
very O
glad O
of O
the O
clear B-DIS
skin I-DIS
, O
but O
as O
time O
went O
on O
, O
I O
just O
felt O
miserable O
knowing O
the O
medication O
was O
making O
me O
feel O
so O
ill. O
Any O
good O
feelings O
of O
clear O
skin O
went O
by O
the O
wayside O
to O
nausea B-DIS
, O
tiredness B-DIS
, O
etc O
. O
Add O
those O
considerations O
onto O
wanting O
a O
baby O
in O
a O
few O
years O
, O
I O
personally O
don O
t O
think O
it O
is O
worth O
the O
risk O
. O
Bonerstorm O
has O
a O
good O
idea O
. O
Try O
not O
taking O
them O
and O
pushing O
the O
issue O
with O
your O
derm O
. O

If O
you O
know O
for O
sure O
hot O
water O
is O
a O
no-no O
, O
then O
they O
must O
have O
provided O
you O
with O
cleaning O
instructions O
, O
right O
If O
this O
is O
a O
hard O
plastic O
piece O
, O
you O
should O
buy O
some O
denture O
bubbling O
cleaning O
tablets O
. O
You O
drop O
the O
piece O
into O
a O
glass O
of O
water O
with O
the O
bubbling O
tablets O
. O
If O
it O
s O
a O
more O
pliable O
or O
rubbery O
type O
material O
, O
I O
d O
wash O
it O
with O
a O
toothbrush O
, O
just O
as O
if O
it O
were O
your O
teeth O
. O

PT O
can O
help O
a O
lot O
, O
speech O
therapy O
too O

yup O

Sounds O
similar O
to O
what O
I O
was O
dealing O
with O
as O
I O
was O
being O
diagnosed O
with O
POTS B-DIS
... O

Nice O
comment O
from O
an O
educator O
. O
As O
a O
teacher O
myself O
, O
I O
m O
kind O
of O
shocked O
. O
How O
did O
you O
feel O
about O
that O
Did O
the O
lecturer O
apologise O

They O
think O
of O
themselves O
way O
*too* O
much O
even O
for O
my O
own O
tastes O
, O
greedy O
hoarders O
, O
sickly O
prideful O
a O
bit O
racist O
and O
look O
on O
everyone O
else O
like O
you O
are O
nothing O
while O
not O
doing O
anything O
themselves O
. O
Also O
huge O
, O
over-evolved O
lizards O
You O
know O
what O
they O
are O
good O
for O
Crafting O
armours O
, O
weapons O
from O
their O
scales O
, O
bones O
, O
etc O
. O
other O
their O
parts O
for O
magical O
artifacts O
, O
plus O
their O
blood O
and O
some O
other O
liquids O
and O
ehm O
... O
material O
for O
alchemic O
potions O
elixirs O
and O
some O
other O
experiments O
. O
Sure O
there O
are O
exceptions O
and O
you O
can O
make O
a O
friend O
one O
or O
two O
of O
them O
through O
hardship O
and O
stuff O
, O
but O
overall O
my O
first O
reaction O
will O
be O
the O
same O
- O
i O
don O

I O
had O
midazolam B-DRUG
for O
my O
colonoscopy O
and O
it O
had O
absolutely O
no O
effect O
on O
me O
. O
I O
was O
wide O
awake O
and O
fully O
aware O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
what O
dose O
they O
gave O
me O
. O
I O
also O
had O
fentanyl B-DRUG
and O
that O
worked O
pretty O
good O
. O
I O
know O
because O
for O
my O
flexi O
sigmoidoscopy O
I O
didn O
t O
have O
any O
sedation O
or O
pain O
relief O
and O
it O
hurt O
sooo O
bad O
but O
my O
colonoscopy O
wasn O
t O
really O
painful O
. O

No O
. O
I O
couldn O
t O
even O
get O
mine O
to O
try O

Your O
road O

are O
going O

finding O
a O
physician O
to O
prescribe O
it O
and O
trying O
to O
get O
insurance O
to O
pay O
for O
it O
. O
It O
s O
likely O
not O
on O
their O
formulary O
and O
or O
in O
their O
medical O
necessity O
criteria O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
dysautonomia B-DIS
, O
so O
I O
would O
not O
anticipate O
it O
being O
eligible O
for O
insurance O
. O
That O
said O
, O
you O
can O
appeal O

Broth O
has O
more O

Sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
your O
stricture B-DIS

how O
long O
have O
you O
had O

Really O

Honestly O
this O
Reddit O
and O
you O
guys O
are O
what O
s O
keeping O
me O
sane O
though O
this O

It O
s O
so O
good O
to O
know O
that O
no O
one O

knows O
exactly O
what O
to O

Helps O

Thanks O
for O
your O
perspective O
- O
when O
I O
say O
forgiveness O
, O
I O
don O
t O
mean O
reconciliation O
or O
contact O
. O
I O
mean O
forgiveness O
that O
we O
feel O
in O
our O
hearts O
, O
where O
we O
are O
able O
to O
release O
ourselves O
from O
the O
stubborn O
energy O
formed O
by O
resentment O
. O
Non-forgiveness O
choosing O
who O
gets O
it O
and O
who O
doesn O
t O
gives O
us O
an O
illusion O
of O
control O
that O
our O
egos O
desperately O
cling O
onto O
. O
It O
also O
keeps O
us O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
separate O
self O
, O
which O
is O
why O
so O
many O
BPD B-DIS
sufferers O
feel O
separate O
and O
disconnected O
from O
others O
. O
I O
would O
never O
discount O
someone O
s O
story O
of O
victimization O
- O
indeed O
, O
people O
with O
BPD B-DIS
have O
likely O
suffered O
more O
victimizing O
situations O
than O
most O
. O
But O
to O
me O
, O
spirituality O
has O
been O
about O
releasing O
the O
story O
of O
betrayal O
, O
wrongdoing O
, O
unfairness O
, O
etc O
and O
instead O
embracing O
something O
higher O
. O
If O
we O
only O
forgave O
people O
who O
deserve O
it O
, O
it O
d O
be O
easy O
as O
pie O
. O
For O
me O
, O
real O
healing O
began O
when O
I O
forgave O
the O
people O
who O
didn O
t O
feel O
remorse O
or O
guilt O
for O
what O
they O
d O
done O
. O
Of O
course O
the O
lessons O
remain O
, O
and O
I O
d O
never O
make O
contact O
with O
them O
. O
But O
my O
body O
no O
longer O
carries O
the O
heaviness B-DIS
and I-DIS
dread I-DIS
of I-DIS
the I-DIS
trauma I-DIS
, O
because O
it O
is O
not O
mine O
to O
carry O
. O

Welcome O

Feel O
free O

anything O
there O
can O

no O

The O

is O
two O

away O
, O
I O
live O
in O
a O
basically O
unincorporated O
township O

Lol O
whatever O
... O
The O
point O
WAS O
that O
IDGAF O
about O
making O
online O
friends O
that O
s O
not O
real O
, O
that O
doesn O
t O
get O
me O
out O
of O
the O

, O
that O
just O
let O
s O
me O
sink O
further O
into O

weird O
hermit O
despressive B-DIS
bs O
. O
The O
internet O
here O
isn O
t O
even O
solid O
enough O
to O
play O
hearthstone O
, O
let O
alone O
attempt O
any O
kind O
of O
real O
time O
audio O

To O
paint O
you O
a O
better O
picture O
, O
my O
graduating O

was O
less O
than O
70 O

, O
I O
know O
most O
people O
my O
age O
within O
the O
area O
already O
Edit O
sorry O
that O
was O
kinda O
rude O
, O
I O
m O
having O
a O
really O
bad O
day O
. O
My O
point O
is O
simply O
this O
, O
I O
ve O
lived O
here O
a O
long O
time O
, O
I O
ve O
never O
met O
another O
gamer O
, O
people O
here O
mostly O
are O
into O
ATVs O
and O
mud O
, O
or O
are O
part O
of O
the O
nearby O
city O
music O
scene O
. O
In O
addition O
for O
me O
politics O
DO O
matter O
as O
I O
am O
a O
homosexual O
and O
many O
of O
the O
people O
around O
me O
hate O
me O
for O
it O
. O

I O
m O
a O
T1 B-DIS
for O
26 O
years O
now O
, O
and O
this O
shit O
still O
happens O
to O
me O
. O
Don O
t O
beat O
yourself O
up O
over O
it O
. O

Whether O
or O
not O
it O
s O
a O
waste O
for O
you O
, O
you O
were O
giving O
advice O
to O
someone O
who O
is O
new O
to O
managing O
their O
and O
has O
no O
baseline O
. O
So O
telling O
them O
to O
do O
more O
useless O
testing O
and O
not O
even O
mentioning O
testing O
post O
meals O
is O
pretty O
poor O
advice O
. O

Do O
you O
believe O
this O
can O
be O
hashimotos B-DIS
swing I-DIS
vs O
nodules B-DIS

There O
are O
many O
types O
of O
jobs O
you O
can O
get O
, O
like O
having O
a O
PHD O
would O
definitely O
open O
so O
many O
doors O
for O
you O
in O
terms O
of O
even O
having O
specialized O
jobs O
without O
many O
hours O
. O
I O
think O
it O
s O
about O
finding O
a O
job O
or O
career O
that O
suits O
your O
type O
of O
BPD B-DIS
, O
which O
might O
be O
the O
type O
that O
comes O
out O
the O
most O
during O
times O
of O
stress B-DIS
. O
Like O
you O
just O
need O
to O
be O
self O
aware O
, O
to O
know O
your O
own O
triggers O
and O
your O
own O
ability O
to O
cope O
in O
stressful O
situations O
. O
Like O
if O
you O
re O
in O
a O
situation O
where O
you O
re O
going O
to O
be O
in O
a O
high O
level O
stress O
job O
like O
a O
doctor O
or O
a O
lawyer O
, O
maybe O
you O
re O
in O
the O
wrong O
field O
. O
Really O
I O
m O
just O
speculating O
, O
but O
it O
feels O
from O
your O
post O
and O
that O
added O
extra O
info O
about O
you O
doing O
a O
PHD O
that O
you O
are O
a O
high O
achiever O
or O
have O
the O
all O
or O
nothing O
approach O
to O
success O
and O
jobs O
, O
or O
are O
putting O
yourself O
under O
more O
stress O
than O
you O
can O
handle O
and O
breaking O
under O
it O
and O
therefore O
seeing O
yourself O
as O
a O
failure O
. O
Also O
BPD B-DIS
isn O
t O
exactly O
a O
mental B-DIS
illness I-DIS
, O
it O
s O
a O
personality B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
, O
there O
is O
a O
slight O
difference O
because O
a O
personality B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
can O
be O
dealt O
with O
without O
pills O
and O
things O
while O
a O
real O
mental B-DIS
illness I-DIS
, O
like O
skizophrenia B-DIS
or O
bipolar B-DIS
, O
is O
really O
out O
of O
a O
person O
s O
control O
and O
they O
always O
need O
meds O
. O
Consider O
finding O
aspects O
about O
life O
that O
you O
might O
enjoy O
that O
you O
ve O
never O
thought O
of O
doing O
before O
. O
Such O
as O
going O
on O
a O
6 O
month O
volunteering O
trip O
to O
Kenya O
or O
doing O
a O
course O
in O
some O
kind O
of O
craft O
making O
, O
like O
jewelry O
, O
just O
to O
sort O
of O
mix O
up O
your O
life O
a O
bit O
to O
find O
new O
potential O

paths O
that O
are O
less O
stressful O
than O
the O
one O
you O
re O
clearly O
walking O
now O
which O
is O
blown O
up O
your O
BPD B-DIS
. O
Your O
BPD B-DIS
will O
make O
you O
think O
that O
just O
because O
you O
re O
not O
finding O
one O
thing O
easy O
, O
or O
you O
might O
even O
not O
be O
doing O
well O
in O
something O
, O
automatically O
means O
you O
re O
an O
all O
round O
failure O
while O
a O
healthy O
person O
would O
see O
it O
as O
they O
re O
just O
not O
suited O
for O
whatever O
they O
re O
doing O
right O
now O
and O
they O
need O
to O
look O
for O
something O
else O
to O
do O
instead O
. O
They O
wouldn O
t O
feel O
the O
failure O
like O
we O
do O
, O
because O
that O
is O
just O
our O
black O
and O
white O
, O
all O

nothing O

Does O
she O
remember O
you O
at O
all O

What O
about O
one O
of O
those O

where O
you O

one O

did O
you O

Thanks O
, O
that O
a O
great O
idea O
. O
We O
use O
fake O
bacon O
bits O
on O
lots O
of O
stuff O

Yes O
, O
I O
ll O
use O
straws O
sometimes O
to O
drink O
if O
I O
am O
super B-DIS
thirsty I-DIS
and O
don O
t O
want O
to O
wait O
until O
I O
can O
actually O
hold O
the O
cup O
. O
We O
aren O
t O
alone O
in O
these O
difficulties O
Sometimes O
it O
feels O
like O
I O
am O
the O
only O
person O
in O
the O
world O
with O
this O
, O
and O
that O
the O
experiences O
other O
people O
have O
with O
CFS B-DIS
are O
so O
different O
from O
mine O
that O
maybe O
they O
got O
the O
diagnoses O
wrong O
. O
But O
again O
then O
the O
EMG O
tests O
ruled O
out O
other O
causes O
of O
the O
muscle B-DIS
weakness I-DIS
. O

I O
m O
not O
sure O
. O
Is O
there O
a O
way O
to O
call O
her O
doctor O
to O
ask O
them O
to O
assess O
her O
while O
she O
s O
there O
Or O
would O
I O
ask O
her O
to O
ask O
her O
doctor O
That O
s O
really O
awkward O
Lol O

Bystolic B-DRUG
is O
a O
beta O
blocker O
. O
It O
only O
effects O
my O
heart O
rate O

My O
blood B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
was I-DIS
normal I-DIS
to I-DIS
very I-DIS
low I-DIS
before O
starting O

has O
stayed O
the O
same O
since O
. O
I O
got O
dysautonomia B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
immediately O
after O
my O
first O
and O
only O
C.diff B-DIS
infection O

After O
a O

I O
never O

my O
old O
self O
, O
it O
was O
as O
if O
everything O
in O
my O
body O
way O
going O
haywire O

I O
was O
extremely O
lucky O
that O
I O
happened O
to O
be O
working O
for O
a O
Cardiologist O
at O
the O
time O
. O
He O
gave O
me O
samples O
of O
Bystolic B-DRUG
after O
listing O
off O
my O
symptoms O
and O
while O
I O
never O
feel O
100 O
full O
of O
energy O
, O
I O
do O
feel O
it O
s O
vastly O
better O
than O
not O
being O
on O
it O
. O
I O
was O
a O
total B-DIS
zombie I-DIS
and O
it O
made O
it O
possible O
to O
work O
again O
without O
falling B-DIS
asleep I-DIS
at I-DIS
my I-DIS
desk I-DIS
. O
I O
never O
noticed O
any O
bad O
side O
effects O
too O
. O
I O
started O
out O
on O
2.5mg O
first O
thing O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
felt O
more O
relief O
when O
I O
tried O
the O
5mg O
to O
compare B-DIS
. O
Samples O
are O
just O
awesome O
Nothing O
I O
take O
helps O
my O
symptoms O
more O
than O
Bystolic B-DRUG
. O
Cannibis B-DRUG
being O
next O
in O
line O
; O
it O
seriously O
helps O
with O
a O
wide O
range O
of O
problems O
. O
I O
hope O
this O
helps O
. O
Please O
feel O
free O

I O
can O

t O
take O
in O
what O

All O
you O

of O
her O
soothing O
herself O
. O
Or O
play O
music O
white O
noise O
machine O
around O
you O
to O
see O
if O
it O
helps O
drown O
her O
out O
I O
d O
say O
earplugs O
, O
but O
if O
you O
re O
the O
caretaker O
you O
ll O
probably O
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
hear O
if O
she O
needs O
help O
. O
Not O
sure O
how O
advanced O
she O
is O
, O
but O
maybe O
giving O
her O
laundry O
to O
fold O
See O
if O
that O
distracts O
her O
Maybe O
putty O
or O
play O
doh O
to O
keep O
her O
hands O
busy O
Or O
maybe O
a O
doll O
to O
see O
if O
that O
is O
a O
comfort O
Or O
maybe O
even O
a O
rocking O
chair O
See O
if O
the O
repetitive O
movement O
helps O
soother O
her O
instead O
of O
the O
whistling O
. O

My O
first O
therapist O
never O
ever O
told O
me O
. O
She O
never O
mentioned O
BPD B-DIS
or O
any O
diagnosis O
at O
all O
. O
But O
she O
wrote O
it O
in O
her O
report O
to O
my O
second O
therapist O
, O
which O
my O
second O
therapist O
let O
me O
read O
. O
Then O
my O
new O
therapist O
spent O
a O
lot O
of O
time O
giving O
me O
materials O
to O
read O
and O
explaining O
things O
. O

Healthy O
people O
get O
an O
unlimited O
amount O
of O
spoons O
what O
they O
can O
accomplish O
in O
a O
day O
. O
Chronically O
ill O
people O
have O
a O
limited O
amount O
of O
spoons O
we O
can O
only O
do O
so O
much O
in O
a O
day O
before O
feeling O
exhausted B-DIS
. O

Yeah O
I O
agree O
with O
you O
, O
it O
s O
definitely O
not O
the O
most O
sound O
science O
available O
but O
all O
it O
really O
shows O
that O
there O
is O
something O
more O
going O
on O
behind O
the O
scenes O
then O
just O
serum O
thyroid O
levels O
. O
I O
think O
doing O
thyroid O
hormone O
supplementation O
should O
be O
way O
before O
trying O
a O
form O
of O
antidepressant O
. O
I O
ll O
be O
sure O
to O
let O
everyone O
here O
know O
if O
I O
find O
anything O
to O
be O
very O
helpful O
. O

It O
is O
an O
awful O
thing O
. O
I O
m O
just O
constantly O
alone O
with O
my O
thoughts O
, O
there O
s O
just O
too O
much O
of O
my O
own O
voice O
in O
my O
head O
. O
I O
completely O
get O
you O
. O
You O
know O
, O
even O
hanging O
around O
the O
people O
who O
have O
abused O
me O
makes O
me O
feel O
better O
, O
but O
only O
sometimes O
. O
Just O
interacting O
with O
them O
socially O
makes O
me O
feel O
like O
I O
m O
not O
alone O
, O
even O
though O
what O
they O
say O
hurts O
me O
even O
more O
. O

Same O
here O
. O
And O
when O
I O
m O
unable B-DIS
to I-DIS
stomach I-DIS
anything I-DIS
and O
am O
starving O
but O
know O
if O
I O
eat O
shots O
gon O
na O
go O
wild O
and O
everyone O
around O
me O
is O
eating O
... O
..bad O
bms O
ruin O
me O
... O
I O
m O
drained B-DIS
of I-DIS
energy I-DIS
and O
my O
whole B-DIS
body I-DIS
aches I-DIS
. O
This O
disease O
sucks O
big O
time O
but O
everyday O
I O
m O
finding O
more O
ways O
to O
cope O
. O
Remember O
it O
s O
okay O
to O
stay O
in O
bed O
for O
a O
whole O
day O

In O
some O
cases O
probably O
but O
my O
natropath O
has O
a O
medical O
degree O
as O
well O
. O
And O
honestly O
she O
s O
figured O
out O
a O
problem O
that O
multiple O
doctors O
and O
specialists O
haven O
t O
. O

Well O
, O
we O
re O
not O
infectious O
As O
far O
as O
I O
know O
... O
so O
don O
t O
call O
the O
CDC O
just O
yet O
A O
normal O
endo O
will O
do O
, O
at O
least O
that O
s O
what O
I O
got O
sent O
to O
after O
eliminating O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
. O
There O
s O
no O
clear O
cut O
tests O
for O
us O
yet O
, O
but O
eliminating O
various O
nasty O
stuff O
along O
with O
putting O
on O
EKG O
pads O
and O
doing O
some O
time O
on O
an O
ergometer O
bike O
seems O
to O
be O
way O
they O
test O
for O
it O
. O
There O
seems O
to O
be O
some O
news O
about O
biomarkers O
coming O
from O
Australian O
scientists O
, O
but O
I O
ll O
believe O
it O
when O
I O
see O
it O
; O

Honestly O
not O
sure O
. O
It O
can O
vary O
based O
on O
the O
drug O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
biologics B-DRUG
for O
GI O
use O
are O
approved O
for O
arthritis B-DIS
or O
psoriasis B-DIS
first O
so O
they O
tend O
to O
be O
shorter O
than O
a O
brand O
new O
drug O
. O

That O
s O
what O
they O
are O
wanting O
to O
do O
now O
. O
I O
m O
thinking O
I O
ll O
go O
forward O
with O
the O
double O
balloon O
and O
let O
them O
get O
what O
they O
need O
. O
Def O
classic B-DIS
crohns I-DIS
. O
Every O
morning O
, O
I O
wake O
up O
in O
pain B-DIS
and O
now O
I O
m O
typing O
this O
message O
from O
the O
throne O
. O
Lol O
. O

That O
s O
really O
sad O
for O
all O
concerned O
, O
so O
sorry O
you O
and O
your O
family O
went O
through O
this O
. O
20 O
years O
is O
such O
a O
very O
long O
time O
to O
linger O
through O
a O
devastating O
disease O
. O

Which O
one O
did O
you O
use O

I O
have O
seen O
plenty O
of O
stories O
of O
doctors O
saying O
we O
re O
faking O
it O
in O
the O
UK O
too O
. O
I O
read O
an O
article O
in O
the O
Independent O
that O
was O
written O
by O
a O
14 O
year O
old O
girl O
whose O
GP O
had O
started O
shouting O
at O
her O
that O
she O
needed O
to O
grow O
up O
and O
stop O
playing O
these O
games O
if O
she O
ever O
wanted O
to O
amount O
to O
anything O
. O
We O
re O
winning O
the O
war O
though O
. O
Attitudes O
are O
really O
changing O
. O
A O
neurologist O
was O
doing O
an O
AMA O
the O
other O
day O
, O
and O
I O
asked O
him O
what O
he O
thought O
about O
ME B-DIS
. O
He O
said O
that O
he O
understood O
that O
there O
had O
been O
some O
debate O
over O
it O
for O
quite O
a O
long O
time O
, O
but O
that O
he O
was O
now O
confident O
it O
is O
a O
physiological B-DIS
condition I-DIS
. O
We O
re O
on O
the O
frontline O
of O
a O
revolution O
, O
whether O
we O
like O
it O
or O
not O
. O
History O
is O
being O
made O
and O
these O
years O
will O
go O
down O
as O
the O
pivotal O
moment O
in O
the O
history O
of O
ME O
. O

Black B-DIS
, O
smelly B-DIS
, O
tar B-DIS
like I-DIS
stools I-DIS
can O
indicate O
bleeding B-DIS
. O
If O
it O
keeps O
happening O
I O
would O
definitely O
see O
a O
doctor O
. O
I O
ve O
never O
had O
black B-DIS
stools I-DIS
from O
vegetables O
or O
blueberries O
, O
but O
you O
can O
always O
change O
what O
you O
are O
eating O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

You O
re O
very O
welcome O
Periods O
of O
transient B-DIS
hyperthyroidism I-DIS
are O
common O
with O
Hashimoto O
s. O
I O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
as O
hyperthyroid B-DIS
and O
then O
a O
month O
or O
so O
later O
hypo B-DIS
Hashi O
s. O
I O
wish O
someone O
would O
have O
told O
me O
that O
at O
the O
time O
- O
it O
s O
good O
to O
be O
aware O
of O
all O
of O
the O
possibilities O
. O
Good O
luck O
to O
ya O

thats O
great O
to O
read O
, O
progression O
is O
always O
nice O
try O
to O
maintain O
it O
, O
as O
its O
safe O
to O
know O
that O
there O
will O
be O
times O
like O
those O
you O
came O
from O
. O
i O
feel O
rather O
shallow O
to O
write O
that O
stuff O
, O
but O
when O
i O
learned O
one O
thing O
the O
hard O
way O
is O
, O
to O
not O
indulge O
too O
much O
into O
remission O
. O
as O
a O
matter O
of O
fact O
, O
remission O
is O
no O
one O
way O
road O
. O
there O
are O
lots O
of O
snares O
. O

And O
you O
thought O
4 O
weeks O
was O
delayed O
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
support O
. O
I O
saw O
some O
improvement O
with O
my O
gut O
, O
but O
in O
my O
last O
of O
the O
4 O
weeks O
of O
my O
anti-SIBO B-DRUG
diet I-DRUG
came O
down O
with O
a O
really O
, O
really O
nasty B-DIS
infection I-DIS
that O
required O
2 O
weeks O
of O
antibiotics B-DRUG
. O
And O
then O
final O
exams O
. O
And O
then O
changed O
jobs O
. O
And O
then O
my O
boyfriend O
moved O
in O
with O
me O
. O
Needless O
to O
say O
, O
I O
m O
almost O
back O
at O
square O
one O
in O
terms O
of O
diet O
and O
health O
because O
I O
just O
didn O
t O
have O
the O
time O
for O
almost O
2 O
months O
, O
I O
m O
just O
hoping O
I O
actually O
managed O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
my O
SIBO B-DIS
and O
that O
it O
s O
an O
easier O
fix O
this O
time O
. O
I O
went O
back O
to O
see O
my O
naturopath O
before O
I O
went O
on O
antibiotics O
, O
and O
she O
clarified O
that O
I O
didn O
t O
need O
to O
worry O
so O
much O
about O
dextrose O
and O
stuff O
in O
foods O
, O
but O
to O
stick O
to O
a O
general O
if O
it O
tastes O
sweet O
, O
don O
t O
eat O
it O
policy O
, O
and O
the O
plan O
was O
to O
slowly O
introduce O
foods O
back O
into O
my O
diet O
and O
she O
would O
help O
me O
balance O
the O
sugars O
in O
foods O
so O
that O
I O
could O
eat O
them O
again O
. O
It O
feels O
kind O
of O
pointless O
to O
go O
back O
now O
after O
having O
undone O
all O
the O
work O
we O
did O
so O
I O
want O
to O
get O
back O
on O
track O
for O
a O
month O
before O
seeing O
her O
again O
, O
I O
just O
don O
t O
know O
what O
I O
m O
going O
to O
do O
about O
my O
diet O
. O
I O
might O
just O
do O
Whole O
30 O
it O
s O
the O
closest O
to O
what O
she O
has O
me O
on O
minus O
whatever O
I O
know O
I O
can O
t O
digest O
. O
I O
dunno O
. O

A O
great O
deal O
. O
I O
ve O
been O
using O
CBD B-DRUG
strains I-DRUG
, O
for O
a O
few O
years O
now O
and O
as O
part O
of O
my O
treatment O
regimen O
which O
includes O
Humira B-DRUG
, O
amp O
; O
Imurane B-DRUG
I O
find O
it O
really O
helpful O
. O
Most O
of O
my O
strains O
also O
contain O
THC B-DRUG
to O
help O
numb O
the O
pain B-DIS
, O
but O
I O
have O
at O
least O
1 O
or O
2 O
that O
are O
pure O
CBD B-DRUG
. O

That O
thing O
brings O
back O
nightmares B-DIS
. O

Started O
taking O
medication O
and O
psychiatric O
treatment O
in O
December O
2015 O
, O
along O
with O
appointments O
with O
a O
psychologist O
. O
My O
doctor O
stopped O
my O
meds O
in O
last O
November O
, O
and O
my O
appointments O
with O
psychologist O
are O
now O
monthly O
. O
Last O
December O
I O
finished O
nursing O
school O
. O
Now O
I O
m O
in O
vacation O
looking O
for O
a O
job O
waiting O
for O
the O
residency O
exam O
s O
results O
. O
Feeling O
pretty O
good O
actually O
. O
Don O
t O
have O
the O
physical O
symptoms O
of O
the O
disorder O
since O
last O
May O
, O
I O
think O
, O
and O
the O
psychiatric O
ones O
stopped O
at O
the O
same O
time O
. O
I O
know O
is O
hard O
guys O
, O
but O
PLEASE O
seek O
treatment O
. O
Family O
and O
friends O
can O
help O
and O
support O
you O
sometimes O
, O
but O
they O
don O
t O
know O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
depression B-DIS
. O
I O
ve O
been O
lurking O
here O
for O
sometime O
, O
trying O
to O
help O
people O
and O
be O
example O
that O
we O
can O
fight O
against O
depression B-DIS
, O
and O
win O
. O
And O
get O
out O
of O
it O
stronger O
. O

Are O
you O
sure O
it O
s O
IBS B-DIS
Have O
you O
had O
any O
tests O
done O

Thankfully O
, O
I O
found O
a O
other O
one O
And O
got O
there O
in O
time O

Thanks O
for O
all O
the O
advice O
and O
kind O
words O
everyone O
. O
I O
got O
a O
CT O
scan O
done O
today O
per O
the O
request O
of O
my O
ENT O
. O
Hopefully O
, O
I O
can O
get O
all O
of O
this O
under O
control O
ASAP O
and O
get O
my O
life O
back O

Normal O
is O
50 O
. O
IBD B-DIS
concerns O
start O
around O
200 O
from O
what O
I O
understand O
. O
When O
I O
had O
pancolitis B-DIS
my O
Calprotectin B-DRUG
was O
over O
1000 O
and O
they O
got O
me O
in O
for O
a O
scope O
. O
I O
have O
also O
heard O
that O
Calprotectin O
can O
be O
raised O
due O
to O
other O
inflammation B-DIS
in O
your O
system O
, O
like O
allergies B-DIS
. O
Personally O
I O
wouldn O
t O
be O
worried O
about O
63 O
, O
but O
I O
m O
not O
a O
doctor O
. O

Hey O
, O
it O
might O
not O
be O
helpful O
to O
your O
specific O
situation O
, O
however O
I O
do O
hope O
it O
offers O
at O
least O
some O
solace O
. O
One O
thing O
that O
I O
always O
think O
of O
when O
I O
m O
feeling O
my O
worst O
is O
Even O
if O
I O
lose O
everything O
, O
I O
don O
t O
want O
to O
to O
lose O
to O
myself O
. O
If O
your O
friends O
aren O
t O
responding O
to O
any O
of O
your O
messages O
then O
my O
guess O
is O
that O
they O
aren O
t O
really O
friends O
. O
Your O
best O
friend O
is O
yourself O
, O
so O
maybe O
start O
trying O
to O
communicate O
your O
feelings O
to O
yourself O
and O
pinpoint O
where O
exactly O
they O
re O
coming O
from O
. O

Yes O
I O
have O
this O
kind O
. O
It O
sucks O

I O
think O
it O
s O
done O
the O
opposite O
for O
me O
. O
I O
used O
to O
be O
a O
reserved B-DIS
kid I-DIS
when O
I O
was O
very O
sick O
around O
ages O
10-14 O
but O
once O
I O
got O
on O
a O
treatment O
that O
worked O
I O
blossomed O
and O
became O
more O
social O
in O
high O
school O
. O
I O
guess O
that O
s O
kind O
of O
the O
opposite O
of O
most O
people O
who O
develop O
it O
later O
but O
even O
today O
I O
enjoy O
sharing O
Crohn O
s O
stories O
for O
shock O
value O

What O
s O
fmt O

have O
done O
that O
as O
well O
to O
no O
avail O
but O
i O
appreciate O
the O
suggestion O
i O
have O
an O
incredible O
GI O
doctor O
who O
does O
abdominal O
ultrasounds O
LFT O
pretty O
regularly O
since O
i O
lost B-DIS
my I-DIS
gallbladder I-DIS
a O
little O
over O
a O
year O
ago O
but O
i O
appreciate O
the O
suggestion O
. O
i O
did O
starch O
based O
as O
well O
but O
it O
made O
me O
feel O
worse O
probably O
bc O
i O
was O
unintentionally O
low O
carb O
for O
so O
long O
aka O
paleo O
and O
my O
body O
doesn O
t O
like O
it O
so O
i O
m O
slowly O
upping O
my O
carbs O
but O
not O
much O
of O
a O
difference O
at O
all O
tbh O
it O
all O
kind O
of O
makes O
me O
feel O
like O
... O
what O
if O
my O
root O
cause O
is O
just O
... O
bad O
genetics O
... O
like O
... O
i O
have O
taken O
really O
good O
care O
of O
myself O
w O
nutrition O
and O
exercise O
from O
a O
young O
age O
yet O
... O
i O
still O
became O
ill O
... O
my O
dad O
rides O
100 O
miles O
a O
week O
on O
a O
bike O
and O
still O
got O
terminal B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
last O
year O
... O
almost O

Your O

never O
changed O
but O
what O
exactly O
are O
they O
In O
range O
does O
not O
always O
equate O
to O
ideal O
... O
. O
your O
doctor O
should O
treat O
based O
on O
labs O
*and* O
symptoms O

If O
you O
re O
symptomatic O
, O
your O
levels O
are O
not O
ideal O
. O
Edit O
also O
... O
. O
don O
t O
skip O
your O
meds O
. O
Taking O
them O
early O
or O
late O
is O
better O
than O
skipping O

Instructions O

take O

I O
take O
miralax B-DRUG
and O
even O
that O
doesn O
t O
do O
it O
sometimes O
, O
i O
found O
water O
as O
alot O
of O
problems O
that O
it O
also O
gives O
me O
is O
the O
best O
way O
, O
so O
keep O
sipping O
, O
if O
i O
drink O
it O
all O
at O
once O
I O
ll O
explode O

once O
a O
week O

What O

Good O
points O
. O
I O
really O
should O
look O
at O
the O
whole O
disability O
benefits O
more O
, O
but O
whenever O
I O
do O
I O
end O
up O
leaving O
with O
the O
impression O
that O
I O
m O
not O
ill O
enough O
for O
anything O
but O
don O
t O
work O
enough O
for O
any O
other O
sort O
of O
help O
. O
Oh O
well O
. O
Thank O
you O
, O
will O
be O
trying O
to O
get O
an O
appointment O
tomorrow O
. O

ok O

All O
the O
salt O
lol O
, O
but O
really O
Honestly O
, O
it O
seems O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can O
tolerate O
while O
keeping O
blood B-DIS
pressure I-DIS
in O
a O
healthy O
range O
. O
You O
should O
still O
talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
about O
it O
. O
I O
take O
8 O
Thermotabs B-DRUG
a O
day O
just O
under O
4 O
grams O
of O
Sodium-Chloride O
I O
think O
and O
whatever O
is O
in O
food O
. O
I O
don O
t O
add O
huge O
amounts O
unless O
it O
s O
in O
soup O
or O
on O
potatoes O
. O
I O
like O
having O
my O
sense O
of O
taste O
. O
And O
of O
course O
you O
need O
the O
right O
about O
of O
water O
to O
go O
with O
it O
. O

Amitriptyline B-DRUG
or O
something O
like O
it O
, O
does O
wonders O
for O
some O
people O
, O
doesn O
t O
work O
for O
others O
. O
I O
can O
take O
it O
and O
I O
m O
fairly O
sensitive O
to O
drugs O
. O
Definitely O
worth O
a O
go O
, O
just O
start O
with O
10mg O
maximum O
. O

I O
use O
a O
Mirena B-DRUG
IUD I-DRUG
not O
sure O
what O
effect O
that O
would O
have O
on O
endometriosis B-DIS
though O
. O
My O
IC B-DIS
is O
triggered O
by O
them O
start O
of O
my O
period O
, O
so O
my O
IUD B-DRUG
is O
super O
helpful O
because O
I O
very O
rarely O
have O
a O
period O
. O

I O
m O
pretty O
sure O
it O
s O
just O
unavoidable O
. O
Most O
of O
those O
issues O
are O
due O
to O
high B-DIS
blood I-DIS
pressure I-DIS
, O
which O
isn O
t O
really O
an O
issue O
for O
POTS B-DIS
patients O
- O
our O
blood O
pressure O
is O
regularly O
too O
low O
. O
The O
benefits O
of O
a O
high O
sodium B-DRUG
diet O
outweigh O
the O
risks O
, O
for O
us O
. O
Low B-DIS
blood I-DIS
pressure I-DIS
is O
just O
as O
bad O
as O
high B-DIS
blood I-DIS
pressure I-DIS
, O
we O
need O
a O
balance O
. O
gt O
; O
Is O
it O
just O
a O
matter O
of O
drinking O
a O
lot O
of O
water O
No O
, O
definitely O
not O
- O
that O
ll O
just O
pull O
all O
the O
salt O
back O
out O
of O
your O
body O
You O
should O
drink O
2L O
of O
water O
a O
day O
, O
on O
average O
, O
slightly O
less O
or O
slightly O
more O
is O
okay O
. O
I O
used O
to O
drink O
5L O
a O
day O
, O
before O
starting O
florinef B-DRUG
sodium B-DRUG
potassium B-DRUG
, O
and O
that O
was O
really O
bad O
, O
apparently O
. O
I O
had O
to O
see O
an O
endocrinologist O
about O
that O
one O
P O
And O
it O
s O
not O
necessary O
to O
see O
a O
nephrologist O
regularly O
- O
you O
can O
if O
you O
want O
, O
but O
one O
appointment O
should O
be O
plenty O
, O
with O
bloodwork O
every O
couple O
of O
months O
and O
maybe O
a O
followup O
if O
you O
re O
worried O
. O
Potassium O
sodium O
whatever O
else O
they O
recommend O
. O
Potassium O
is O
another O
thing O
that O
s O
good O
to O
consume O
, O
BTW O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
re O
on O
a O
medication O
like O
midodrine B-DRUG
or O
florinef B-DRUG
. O
You O
can O
either O
get O
a O
sodium-free O
salt O
usually O
potassium B-DRUG
chloride I-DRUG
at O
the O
grocery O
store O
, O
or O
I O
take O
large O
, O
prescribed O
, O
slow-release O
potassium B-DRUG
tablets O
. O
Source O
Patient O
of O
Dr. O
Jill O
Schofield O
, O
an O
incredible O
physician O
and O
one O
of O
the O
few O
real O
dysautonomia B-DIS
specialists O
out O
there O

I O
really O
can O
t O
imagine O
what O
they O
are O
going O
through O
tbh O

My O
insurance O
did O
cover O
the O
cheaper O
formula O
but O
when O
I O
got O
the O
complex O
formula O
it O
didn O
t O
cover O
all O
of O
it O
. O
I O
know O
sometimes O
the O
infusion O
companies O
can O
ship O
but O
I O
don O
t O
know O
about O
overseas O
. O
There O
are O
also O
some O
formulas O
that O
are O
powder O
that O
you O
mix O
with O
water O
. O
Also O
, O
if O
you O
do O
go O
this O
route O
, O
I O
recommend O
buying O
a O
backpack O
. O
The O
ones O
given O
are O
ugly O
and O
black O
and O
uncomfortable O
. O
I O
spent O
I O
think O
fifty O
and O
had O
someone O
make O
me O
one O
. O

This O
place O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
binding O
garments O
tho O
they O
re O
not O
exactly O
designed O
with O
pots O
in O
mind O
. O
Hopefully O
that O
will O
help O
you O
out O
. O

I O
have O
a O
theory O
that O
my O
flares B-DIS
get I-DIS
worse I-DIS
when I-DIS
laying I-DIS
down I-DIS
because O
the O
back O
side O
of O
my O
bladder O
is O
the O
most O
irritated O
part O
, O
meaning O
when O
laying O
down O
, O
urine O
sits O
and O
rests O
on O
the O
back O
side O
of O
the O
bladder O
more O
, O
causing O
more O
discomfort B-DIS
. O
This O
is O
a O
complete O
guess O
not O
rooted O
in O
science O
but O
just O
wanted O
to O
let O
you O
know O
I O
feel O
the O
same O

Depression B-DIS
is O
hard O
to O
deal O
with O
end O

But O
there O
is O
hope O

Stay O
strong O
we O
are O
all O
here O
in O
the O
same O
boat O
with O
different O
problems O
. O
I O
have O
been O
where O
your O
at O
. O
It O
may O
seem O
hopeless O
now O
but O
You O
will O
get O
trough O
it O
. O
Ive O
been O
depressed B-DIS
for O
a O
long O
time O
. O
I O
dont O
know O
what O
you O
are O
going O
trough O
right O
now O
but O
the O
pain B-DIS
will O
go O
away O
and O
you O
will O
learn O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
your O
issues O
. O

Just O
for O
the O
record O
the O
lesions B-DIS
don O
t O
have O
to O
be O
spread O
across O
all O
those O
regions O
. O
You O
can O
have O
2 O
lesions B-DIS
, O
both O
in O
the O
brain O
but O
in O
different O
locations O
*within* O
the O
brain O
and O
that O
counts O
. O

I O
would O
also O
add O
that O
I O
get O
CBD B-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
at O
500mg O
in O
strength O
. O
I O
ve O
tried O
lesser O
strength O
from O
different O
suppliers O
to O
save O
a O
bit O
of O
money O
and O
it O
was O
useless O
. O

I O
ve O
been O
needing O
this O
information O
, O
too O
Thanks O
to O
all O
commenters O
and O
OP O
for O
asking O

I O
saved O
up O
and O
got O
one O
for O
a O
little O
over O
200 O
on O
Amazon O
. O
I O
got O
it O
for O
insomnia B-DIS
but O
I O
love O
it O
for O
Vertigo B-DIS
. O

MD O
symptoms O
varies O
from O
person O
to O
person O
. O
No O
two O
patients O
are O
same O
. O
In O
my O
case O
, O
Betahistamine B-DRUG
helped O
me O
for O
4 O
months O
. O
I O
was O
without O
symptoms O
for O
4 O
months O
except O
tinnitus B-DIS
. O
Life O
was O
good O
. O
But O
later O
all O
these O
symptoms O
returned O
. O
I O
tred O
Betahistamine O
second O
time O
again O
but O
it O
didn O
t O
helped O
me O
and O
made O
me O
terribly O
nauseating B-DIS
. O
Between O
vertigo B-DIS
and O
nausea O
, O
I O
will O
pick O
vertigo O
anyday O
- O
the O
lesser O
evil O
. O
Nausea O
is O
terrible O
. O
I O
am O
not O
on O
any O
medication O
right O
now O
. O
As O
per O
my O
observation O
, O
alternate O
days O
my O
symptoms O
are O
less O
. O
You O
should O
speak O
to O
your O
doc O
and O
give O
Betahistamines O
a O
go O
. O
Maybe O
it O
will O
work O
for O
you O
. O
Besides O
symptoms O
have O
highs O
and O
low O
days.Your O
symptoms O
seem O
to O
be O
mild O
. O
You O
ll O
learn O
to O
cope O
. O
Don O
t O
worry O
, O
control O
your O
anxiety O
and O
half O
the O
battle O
is O
won O
. O
Good O
luck O
. O

I O
m O
pretty O
set O
on O
asking O
him O
for O
the O
testosterone O
test O
. O
I O
m O
wondering O
if O
he O
ll O
think O
that O
I O
lean O
toward O
being O
a O
hypochondriac B-DIS
if O
I O
ask O
him O
about O
prolactin B-DRUG
right O
away O
. O
I O
have O
high B-DIS
antibodies I-DIS
so O
I O
ve O
got O
a O
good O
reason O
to O
think O
that O
I O
have O
primary B-DIS
hypothyroidism I-DIS
instead O
of O
hypothyroidism B-DIS
from I-DIS
pituitary I-DIS
issues I-DIS
. O

Thank O
you O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
do O
some O
more O
reading O
. O
I O
m O
also O
currently O
undergoing O
testing O
for O
Crohn O
s O
as O
well O
with O
a O
different O
specialist O
. O
I O
ve O
read O
that O
autoimmune B-DIS
diseases I-DIS
come O
in O
pairs O
frequently O
, O
perhaps O
this O
is O
just O
another O
signifier O
of O
that O
. O
Thank O
you O
for O
the O
article O
, O
I O
m O
just O
settling O
in O
to O
give O
it O
a O
thorough O
read O
now O
but O
after O
a O
cursory O
skim O
, O
I O
m O
sure O
I O
ll O
find O
the O
information O
worth O
it O
I O
d O
heard O
about O
hypothyroidism B-DIS
causing O
depression B-DIS
but O
never O
seen O
a O
link O
to O
other O
disorders O
. O
I O
have O
a O
diagnosis O
of O
Bipolar B-DIS
II I-DIS
. O
What O
were O
your O
initial O
symptoms O
, O
if O
you O
don O
t O
mind O
me O
asking O
I O
feel O
ridiculous O
that O
I O
wasn O
t O
treating O
this O
more O
seriously O
before O
a O
few O
months O
ago O
when O
it O
began O
to O
impact O
me O
physically O
. O
Thank O
you O
Hopefully O
it O
goes O
well O
. O

Dang O
, O
I O
m O
sorry O
that O
sucks O
. O
I O
was O
pretty O
sickly O
for O
most O
of O
my O
life O
before O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
. O
But O
when O
the O
stomach B-DIS
issues I-DIS
started O
I O
lost O
40lbs O
in O
6 O
months O
, O
then O
they O
figured O
out O
it O
was O
GP B-DIS
. O
Pretty O
quick O
in O
my O
experience O
. O
I O
m O
intrigued O
by O
the O
other O
disorder O
, O
what O
symptoms O
did O
you O
have O
that O
led O
to O
that O
diagnosis O
I O
ve O
had O
pretty O
awful B-DIS
disorientation I-DIS
, O
vision B-DIS
, O
and O
temperature B-DIS
problems I-DIS
but O
my O
doctors O
attributed O
it O
to O
malnutrition B-DIS
. O
It O
s O
so O
frustrating O
that O
there O
s O
so O
little O
known O
about O
it O
. O
I O
desperately O
want O
to O
know O
why O
this O
happened O
. O
I O
was O
told O
my O
GP O
was O
idiopathic B-DIS
as O
in O
no O
known O
cause O
, O
but O
they O
said O
it O
was O
probably O
caused O
by O
a O
virus B-DIS
. O

You O
might O
find O
this O
article O
helpful O

thats O
what O
i O
was O
thinking O
, O
try O
to O
keep O
things O
as O
familiar O
as O
possible O
. O
they O
were O
thinking O
of O
getting O
a O
copy O
of O
her O
hometowns O
newspaper O
delivered O
there O
since O
she O
liked O
cutting O
out O
news O
articles O
. O
my O
only O
concern O
there O
is O
her O
getting O
used O
to O
everything O
from O
home O
and O
then O
realizing O
she O
wasn O
t O
in O
el O
paso O
, O
i O
think O
that O
would O
cause O
issues O
. O

Why O
were O
you O

Humira B-DRUG
and O
now O
Remicade B-DRUG

Rheumatoid B-DIS

I O
also O
had O
a O
terrible O
stint O
of O
mono B-DIS
which O
contributed O
and O
am O
suspecting O
autoimmune B-DIS
issues I-DIS
... O

Have O
you O
looked O
into O
becoming O
a O
paid O
caregiver O

Why O
is O
your O
prolactin B-DIS
so I-DIS
high I-DIS
Whats O
going O
on O
with O
your O
pituitary B-DIS
gland I-DIS

Thank O
you O
so O
much O

Caretaker O
suspects O
that O
her O
loss B-DIS
of I-DIS
appetite I-DIS
is O
a O
side O
effect O
of O
Donepezil B-DRUG
Aricept B-DRUG
as O
her O
symptom O
began O
shortly O
after O
her O
dosage O
for O
the O
drug O
was O
increased O
by O
the O
doc O
. O
The O
doc O
doesn O
t O
want O
to O
decrease O
the O
dosage O
because O
he O
thinks O
that O
the O
medication O
won O
t O
be O
as O
effective O
in O
dealing O
with O
numerous O
other O
health O
issues O
. O
We O
have O
no O
idea O
what O
to O
do O
. O

My O
entire O
fourth O
grade O
year O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
couldn O
t O
do O
anything O
physical O
without O
getting O
exauhsted O
, O
was O
failing O
every O
class O
and O
was O
just O
miserable O
. O
That O
summer O
me O
and O
my O
dad O
went O
backpacking O
and O
he O
mocked O
that O
I O
had O
to O
go O
to O
the O
restroom O
every O
half O
hour O
or O
so O
due O
to O
the O
water O
. O
This O
was O
followed O
by O
the O
next O
week O
of O
me O
doing O
nothing O
but O
sitting O
on O
the O
couch O
sneaking O
spoonfuls O
of O
sugar O
till O
my O
mom O
noticed O
I O
lost B-DIS
a I-DIS
lot I-DIS
of I-DIS
weight I-DIS
and O
took O
me O
to O
emergency O
care O
. O
Was O
a O
fun O
3 O
day O
stay O
right O
before O
my O
b-day O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
state O
law O
they O
are O
legally O
required O
to O
contact O
another O
doctor O
if O
you O
are O
having O
concrete O
thoughts O
of O
suicide O
. O
And O
then O
you O
have O
to O
convince O
the O
other O
doctor O
that O
you O
are O
not O
about O
to O
kill O
yourself O
. O
Which O
means O
you O
also O
have O
to O
tell O
the O
therapist O
that O
you O
are O
not O
going O
to O
kill O
yourself O
in O
the O
next O
days O
or O
weeks O
. O
It O
s O
difficult O
. O
I O
know O
that O
you O
can O
tell O
me O
anything O
and O
how O
can O
a O
therapist O
help O
if O
you O
aren O
t O
honest O
with O
him O
her O
exist O
. O
But O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
one O
can O
also O
get O
into O
problems O
when O
talking O
about O
suicidal O
thoughts O
, O
at O
least O
from O
my O
experience O
. O
I O
don O
t O
really O
dare O
opening O
up O
about O
this O
anymore O
. O
I O
don O
t O
want O
to O
describe O
how O
detailed O
those O
thoughts O
were O
. O
It O
s O
a O
ditch O
between O
my O
therapist O
and O
me O
, O
but O
I O
don O
t O
know O
how O
to O
solve O
it O
. O

I O
was O
thinking O
this O
exactly O
lately O
, O
thougts O
like O
damn O
must O
feels O
nice O
being O
drunk O
all O
the O
time O
or O
maybe O
weed O
will O
make O
me O
discover O
a O
more O
peacefull O
mind O
have O
crossed O
my O
mind O
quite O
often O

I O
have O
a O
hormonal B-DRUG
IUD I-DRUG
and O
it O
eliminated B-DIS
my I-DIS
periods I-DIS
and O
with O
them O
most O
of O
my O
hormonal B-DIS
flaring I-DIS
. O
I O
had O
pretty O
intense B-DIS
pain I-DIS
cramping B-DIS
for O
24 O
hours O
after O
my O
insertion O
, O
but O
I O
didn O
t O
flare B-DIS
. O
That O
s O
a O
minor O
miracle O
because O
gynecological O
visits O
in O
general O
flare O
me O
. O
I O
ve O
only O
had O
one O
insertion O
though O
so O
not O
much O
of O
a O
sample O
size O
. O
Good O
luck O
, O
I O
hope O
switching O
back O
to O
the O
IUD B-DRUG
helps O
your O
symptoms O

That O
s O
great O
. O
I O
m O
in O
my O
last O
semester O
as O
well O
and O
student O
teaching O
, O
which O
is O
not O
exactly O
low O
stress B-DIS
but O
I O
love O
it O
. O
Working O
has O
been O
very O
difficult O
when O
I O
have O
flares B-DIS
, O
which O
is O
something O
that O
worries O
me O
for O
future O
jobs O
. O

The O
first O
dose O
I O
got O
, O
after O
becoming O
hypo- O
initially O
, O
was O
I O
believe O
150 O
mcg O
. O
That O
made O
me O
VERY O
hyperthyroid B-DIS
. O
The O
last O
time O
around O
I O
received O
75 O
mcg O
which O
as O
you O
mentioned O
is O
the O
lowest O
dose O
, O
and O
I O
reacted O
the O
same O
way O
after O
only O
a O
few O
weeks O
, O
but O
just O
a O
little O
less O
extreme O
. O
My O
Endo O
told O
me O
that O
she O
hasn O
t O
had O
a O
patient O
before O
who O
s O
thyroid B-DIS
reacts O
the O
way O
mine O
does O
. O
And O
yeah O
, O
I O
ve O
heard O
from O
multiple O
people O
to O
look O
into O
supplements O
or O
natural O
remedies O
. O
Not O
sure O
what O
my O
Endo O
s O
view O
on O
that O
would O
be O
, O
but O
I O
ll O
ask O
her O
at O
my O
next O
appointment O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
repsonse O

Ye O
olde O
baking O
soda O
trick O
may O
help O
you O
out O
I O
usually O
mix O
1 O
2 O
teaspoon O
of O
baking O
soda O
with O
4 O
oz O
or O
so O
of O
water O
and O
take O
it O
like O
a O
giant O
shot O
. O
Some O
folks O
do O
a O
full O
teaspoon O
, O
but O
I O
usually O
don O
t O
need O
to O
. O
It O
helps O
take O
the O
edge O
off O
by O
reducing O
the O
acidity B-DIS
of I-DIS
your I-DIS
urine I-DIS
. O
You O
already O
know O
that O
time O
and O
lots O
of O
water O
will O
help O
. O
Make O
sure O
the O
water O
you O
are O
drinking O
is O
not O
acidic O
Dasani O
is O
a O
big O
no O
go O
for O
example O
, O
but O
many O
spring O
waters O
and O
tap O
is O
ok O
, O
just O
test O
your O
tap O
water O
with O
aquarium O
strips O
to O
make O
sure O
. O
I O
m O
no O
medical O
professional O
, O
but O
you O
have O
a O
diagnosis O
already O
, O
so O
another O
cystoscopy O
shouldn O
t O
be O
warranted O
unless O
your O
symptoms O
change O
drastically O
. O
You O
seem O
to O
be O
generally O
in O
a O
good O
place O
, O
so O
one O
bad O
day O
shouldn O
t O
derail O
you O
for O
long O
Perhaps O
consider O
following O
the O
IC O
diet O
for O
a O
while O
if O
you O
aren O
t O
already O
to O
let O
your O
bladder O
calm O
down O
a O
bit O
. O
Lastly O
, O
congrats O
on O
your O
wedding O
That O
s O
fucking O
awesome O
. O
Finding O
your O
person O
is O
the O
best O
. O

How O
much O
do O
you O
weigh O
Just O
because O
you O
have O
T1 B-DIS
doesn O
t O
mean O
you O
re O
immune O
to O
T2 B-DIS
. O
Type B-DIS
2 I-DIS
causes O
insulin B-DIS
resistance I-DIS
in O
the O
body O
typically O
due O
to O
obesity B-DIS
and O
eventual O
beta B-DIS
cell I-DIS
death I-DIS
. O
Obviously O
, O
if O
you O
re O
T1 B-DIS
, O
your O
beta O
cells O
are O
already O
long O
gone O
, O
but O
you O
can O
still O
get O
the O
insulin B-DIS
resistance I-DIS
part O
. O
That O
s O
most O
likely O
why O
you O
were O
prescribed O
Metformin B-DRUG
. O

That O
doesn O
t O
sounds O
typical O
to O
me O
although O
I O
m O
not O
a O
doctor O
of O
course O
. O
Kidney B-DIS
stone I-DIS
pain I-DIS
usually O
feels O
more O
like O
an O
intense O
stabbing O
pain O
in O
your O
kidney O
area O
, O
or O
side O
. O
I O
don O
t O
know O
what O
it O
feels O
like O
once O
the O
stones O
get O
into O
the O
bladder O
if O
you O
can O
feel O
them O
, O
as O
I O
never O
felt O
that O
at O
all O
. O
I O
m O
not O
saying O
it O
s O
not O
that O
, O
but O
it O
doesn O
t O
sound O
entirely O
typical O
to O
me O
based O
on O
the O
location O
and O
description O
of O
the O
pain O
. O

I O
always O
get O
ridiculed O
for O
eating B-DIS
slowly I-DIS
and O
finishing O
my O
food O
last O
and O
not O
eating O
that O
much O
at O
a O
time O
. O
I O
don O
t O
really O
care O
though O
, O
I O
m O
allowed O
to O
do O
what O
I O
want O
if O
it O
doesn O
t O
hurt O
anybody O
else O
. O
I O
take O
Zofran B-DRUG
when O
I O
need O
to O
and O
I O
used O
to O
be O
on O
Motilium B-DRUG
3x O
day O
and O
they O
have O
helped O
so O
well O
. O

How O
does O
the O
doctor O
know O
it O
s O
still O
in O
the O
kidney O
Did O
he O
have O
you O
do O
a O
CT O
scan O
to O
determine O
this O
There O
is O
no O
pain B-DIS
when O
it O
s O
in O
the O
kidney O
. O
Exercise O
can O
make O
it O
come O
out O
of O
the O
kidney O
and O
start O
its O
way O
down O
. O
Apple O
cider O
vinegar O
may O
help O
prevent O
formation O
of O
new O
stones B-DIS

1 O
This O
has O
been O
a O
terrible B-DIS
week I-DIS
for I-DIS
sleep I-DIS
. O
Light B-DIS
is I-DIS
weird I-DIS
, O
noises B-DIS
are I-DIS
louder I-DIS
than I-DIS
they I-DIS
should I-DIS
be I-DIS
, O
it O
s O
almost O
impossible B-DIS
to I-DIS
get I-DIS
to I-DIS
sleep I-DIS
and O
worse B-DIS
trying I-DIS
to I-DIS
stay I-DIS
asleep I-DIS
. O
My O
wife O
is O
out O
like O
a O
light O
right O
now O
. O
I O
m O
pacing O
the O
house O
and O
playing O
on O
reddit O
. O

There O
are O
a O
couple O
limitations O
. O
Before O
the O
surgery O
, O
my O
surgeon O
told O
me O
there O
would O
be O
no O
restrictions O
. O
For O
whatever O
reason O
, O
I O
thought O
I O
d O
be O
able O
to O
start O
running O
again O
something O
that O
my O
rheumatologist O
thought O
was O
insane O
, O
by O
the O
way O
, O
given O
my O
history O
of O
knee B-DIS
injuries I-DIS
. O
After O
the O
surgery O
, O
the O
surgeon O
said O
no O
running O
or O
jumping O
-- O
ever O
-- O
which O
was O
pretty O
upsetting O
at O
the O
time O
. O
I O
decided O
to O
abide O
by O
this O
, O
however O
, O
since O
I O
really O
like O
the O
new O
hip O
and O
want O
it O
to O
last O
, O
so O
I O
took O
up O
swimming O
. O
I O
do O
cheat O
occasionally O
and O
run O
with O
my O
dog O
with O
no O
ill O
effect O
. O
The O
surgeon O
also O
said O
no O
yoga O
poses O
with O
the O
leg O
twisted O
, O
like O
pigeon O
lunge O
. O
I O
think O
this O
restriction O
is O
because O
I O
had O
the O
anterolateral O
approach O
rather O
than O
the O
anterior O
approach O
. O
Now O
that O
it O
s O
been O
several O
years O
, O
I O
m O
pretty O
confidant O
that O
I O
m O
not O
going O
to O
dislocate O
the O
hip O
, O
so O
I O
have O
started O
doing O
yoga O
, O
even O
things O
like O
pigeon O
lunge O
, O
although O
I O
always O
take O
things O
slowly O
. O
I O
was O
worried O
at O
first O
that O
I O
wouldn O
t O
be O
able O
to O
walk O
my O
dog O
. O
He O
s O
62 O
pounds O
and O
pulls O
hard O
on O
the O
leash O
-- O
almost O
uncontrollable O
when O
he O
sees O
a O
rabbit O
. O
I O
did O
some O
extra O
physical O
therapy O
after O
the O
surgery O
to O
work O
on O
balance O
and O
strength O
, O
and O
that O
s O
been O
fine O
. O
The O
limitations O
aren O
t O
all O
that O
limiting O
for O
me O
, O
especially O
since O
I O
could O
bare O
walk O
before O
the O
surgery O
and O
certainly O
couldn O
t O
run O
or O
do O
yoga O

My O
experience O
was O
that O
the O
adhesive O
in O
band-aids O
was O
less O
irritating B-DIS
on I-DIS
skin I-DIS
, O
especially O
sensitive B-DIS
skin I-DIS
, O
and O
using O
them O
for O
adjustment O
wouldn O
t O
take O
any O
more O
than O
one O
pack O
. O
Only O
a O
suggestion O
for O
those O
reading O
, O
no O
harm O
meant O
. O

Same O
. O
Too O
much O
gun O
control O
in O
the O
UK O
And O
if O
you O
even O
say O
the O
word O
suicide O
a O
few O
times O
then O
you O
are O
constantly O
watched O
and O
police O
visit O
your O
home O
if O
someone O
finds O
out O
... O
Not O
fun O
dude O
. O
If O
you O
do O
it O
, O
make O
sure O
it O
works O
. O
If O
not O
, O
don O
t. O
I O
m O
just O
waaaaay O
too O
lazy O
to O
do O
it O
. O
Such O
a O
terrible O
trap O

I O
m O
currently O
going O
through O
the O
same O
thing O
. O
Diagnosed O
in O
December O
, O
had O
bad B-DIS
fluctuations I-DIS
from O
December O
to O
February O
, O
then O
march O
April O
and O
beginning O
of O
may O
were O
good O
. O
Now O
it O
s O
back O
to O
fluctuating B-DIS
again O
Frustrating O
because O
I O
thought O
I O
could O
control O
it O
, O
but O
now O
it O
seems O
like O
I O
can O
t. O
Bottom O
line O
, O
if O
nothing O
else O
you O
re O
not O
alone O
Have O
you O
tried O
prednisone B-DRUG
or O
steroid B-DRUG
shots I-DRUG
That O
works O
for O
some O
people O

Then O
what O
were O
the O
two O
votes O
this O
week O
by O
the O
house O
and O
senate O
Both O
of O
which O
won O
to O
repeal O
some O
parts O
of O
it O
I O
thought O
this O
new O
budget O
would O
get O
rid O
of O
pre-existing O
conditions O
and O
staying O
on O
parents O
insurance O
on O
March O
3rd O
I O
could O
be O
completely O
wrong O
but O
that O
s O
what O
I O
gathered O
from O
the O
articles O
I O
read O
. O
Congress O
vote O
was O
on O
Friday O
and O
Senate O
vote O
was O
on O
Wednesday O
. O

How O
long O
did O
it O
take O
to O
see O
results O
with O
it O

Aargh O
, O
I O
ordered O
a O
HAT O
not O
a O

. O
Looking O
at O
the O
circuitry O
, O
the O
ULN2003A O
has O
7 O
buffers O
; O
we O
need O
6 O
, O
and O
4 O
are O
wired O
up O
. O
There O
is O
an O
unofficial O
diagram O
that O
says O
the O
unused O
3 O
are O
not O
wired O
up O
. O
So O
if O
two O
GPIO O
assigned O
to O
LEDS O
are O
wired O
up O
these O
can O
drive O
2 O
unused O
buffers O
. O
Wiring O
this O
is O
going O
to O
be O
a O
nightmare O
but O
it O
s O
worth O
noting O
for O
others O
. O
I O
ll O
start O
with O
4 O
motors O
. O

You O
ve O
done O
yourself O
almost O
no O
harm O
because O
Copaxone B-DRUG
is O
one O
of O
the O
least O
effective O
medications O
for O
MS B-DIS
. O

This O
reminds O
me O
of O
my O
first O
drop O
in O
2006 O
. O
If O
it O
is O
menieres B-DIS
, O
just O
know O
that O
your O

I O
live O

5 O

my O
neurologist O

almost O
the O
same O
thing O
to O
me O
when O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
the O
beginning O
of O
the O
year O
You O

POTS B-DIS

I O
had O
a O
stone B-DIS
last O
year O
and O
had O
both O
bearable B-DIS
and I-DIS
unbearable I-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
For O
the O
first O
day O
or O
so O
I O
had O
bearable B-DIS
pain I-DIS
where O
I O
could O
sorta O
do O
stuff O
around O
the O
house O
, O
might O
just O
need O
a O
break O
. O
I O
even O
attended O
a O
birthday O
party O
. O
Then O
, O
I O
had O
2 O
separate O
attacks B-DIS
about O
a O
week O
and O
2 O
weeks O
later O
. O
Those O
were O
roll B-DIS
on I-DIS
the I-DIS
ground I-DIS
in I-DIS
agony I-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O

I O
know O
. O
I O
gave O
up O
on O
running O
so O
long O
ago O
I O
can O
t O
even O
remember O
what O
it O
feels O
like O
. O
However O
it O
did O
rekindle O
my O
love O
for O
swimming O
. O

I O
ve O
read O
that O
you O
can O
actually O
bounce O
between O
the O
two O

I O
am O
so O
sorry O
for O
your O
loss O
. O

Yes O

I O
was O
just O
turning O
18 O
at O
the O
time O
and O

multiple B-DIS
stones I-DIS
. O
My O
largest O
was O
just O
at O
the O
threshold O
size O
of O
being O
just O
barely O
able O
to O
be O
passed O
. O
They O
kept O
me O
in O
the O
hospital O
drugged O
up O
due O
to O
the O
extreme B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
I O
was O
completely O
out O
of O
it O
but O
apparently O
still O
in O
pain O
according O
to O
my O
mother O
. O
Every O
time O
I O
peed O
, O
I O
peed B-DIS
a I-DIS
little I-DIS
red I-DIS
due I-DIS
to I-DIS
the I-DIS
blood I-DIS
. O
This O
lasted O
for O
about O
a O
week O
after O
I O
had O
the O
procedures O
. O
I O
don O
t O
remember O
much O
of O
it O
as O
I O
was O
in O
a O
complete O
haze O
the O
entire O
time O
. O
If O
it O
doesn O
t O
hurt O
when O
you O
pee O
it O
most O
likely O
means O
the O
stone B-DIS
is O
not O
lodged O
in O
. O
That O
is O
a O
good O
sign O
. O
This O
sounds O
more O
like O
the O
second O
and O
third O
time O
I O
had O
stones B-DIS
which O
were O
much O
smaller O
. O
The O
second O
stone O
passed O
in O
2 O
days O
while O
the O
3rd O
passed O
while O
I O
was O
still O
in O
the O
ER O
. O
Keep O
drinking O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can O
and O
hopefully O
you O
can O
flush O
it O
right O
through O
. O

Hope O
you O
got O
good O
news O
. O
my O
neurologist O
was O
very O
positive O
today O
. O
medications O
have O
advanced O
greatly O
. O

Contact O
the O
manufacturer O
of O
your O
meter O
. O
Sometimes O
they O
will O
send O
it O
out O
for O
free O
. O

My O
job O
is O
just O
too O
stressful O
, O
the O
client O
isn O
t O
following O
any O
procedures O
they O
themselves O
have O
established O
and O
my O
boss O
doesn O
t O
really O
stand O
by O
us O
. O
I O
am O
extremely O
frustrated O
. O
But O
my O
mom O
and O
my O
brotgher O
work O
for O
an O
organic O
retailer O
and O
they O
told O
me O
that O
they O
have O
big O
projects O
that O
should O
be O
in O
my O
area O
of O
expertise O
. O
I O
called O
them O
on O
monday O
, O
told O
them O
what O
I O
do O
and O
they O
were O
interested O
. O
No O
openings O
right O
now O
, O
but O
they O
are O
interested O
. O
I O
wrote O
a O
motivation O
text O
that O
I O
think O
is O
very O
good O
. O
On O
top O
of O
it O
all O
m O
brother O
told O
me O
he O
met O
one O
of O
the O
team O
leaders O
in O
the O
company O
that O
could O
be O
a O
team O
for O
me O
. O
THis O
guy O
, O
after O
talking O
with O
my O
brother O
, O
discovered O
that O
we O
did O
hang O
out O
at O
the O
same O
places O
, O
had O
the O
same O
friends O
and O
did O
the O
same O
things O
at O
around O
sixteen O
seventeen O
years O
old O
. O
So O
we O
must O
know O
each O
other O
, O
although O
I O
can O
t O
really O
remember O
him O
that O
good O
. O
Fingers O
crossed O
they O
want O
me O
as O
an O
employee O

Edit O
My O
appointment O
is O
this O
coming O
Tuesday O

One O
of O
two O
things O
likely O
occurred O
. O
It O
is O
possible O
you O
have O
complex B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
, O
which O
is O
not O
resolved O
with O
basic O
cpap B-DRUG
. O
It O
requires O
different O
modalities O
Bipap B-DRUG
ST I-DRUG
ASV B-DRUG
that O
take O
time O
to O
achieve O
resolution O
with O
. O
Complex B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
is O
also O
referred O
to O
as O
central B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
. O
The O
other O
possible O
reason O
is O
your O
sleep O
tech O
was O
unable O
to O
completely O
resolve O
your O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
and O
requires O
another O
night O
of O
observation O
with O
alternative O
modalities O
Bipap B-DRUG
. O
Bipap O
can O
be O
utilized O
to O
resolve O
both O
cenral B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
and O
severe B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
with I-DIS
hypoxia I-DIS
. O
Both O
take O
time O
throughout O
the O
night O
to O
see O
resolution O
of O
apnea B-DIS
and O
stabilized O
oxygen O
. O
Sounds O
like O
either O
way O
cpap O
alone O
did O
not O
resolve O
the O
issues O
. O
Yes O
in O
your O
fathers O
case O
and O
many O
other O
cases O
one O
night O
can O
be O
enough O
to O
determine O
a O
diagnosis O
and O
resolve O
with O
cpap O
. O
However O
I O
encourage O
you O
to O
not O
get O
frustrated O
. O
Ask O
your O
tech O
and O
Dr. O
lots O
of O
questions O
about O
why O
bipap B-DRUG
is O
necessary O
and O
why O
cpap O
was O
not O
successful O
, O
it O
is O
your O
right O
to O
know O
. O
Try O
to O
figure O
out O
what O
is O
and O
isn O
t O
happening O
with O
your O
oxygen O
at O
night O
. O
Good O
luck O
. O

Trust O
me O
MS B-DIS
doesn O
t O
make O
a O
good O
boyfriend O
. O
My O
MS B-DIS
comes O
and O
goes O
as O
he O
pleases O
, O
mostly O
showing O
up O
when O
it O
s O
least O
convenient O
. O
And O
he O
treats O
me O
like O
crap O
keeping B-DIS
me I-DIS
up I-DIS
at I-DIS
night I-DIS
and O
making O
my O
days O
rough O
. O
He O
even O
forces O
me O
to O
take O
nasty O
drugs O
and O
steals O
my O
money O
leaving O
me O
broke O
. O
I O
m O
sorry O
you O
re O
having O
a O
hard O
time O
. O

You O
r O
welcome O

It O
s O
possible O
under O
the O
circumstances O
that O
you O
have O
described O
. O
But O
90 O
blockage O
should O
still O
have O
some O
physical O
manifestations O
. O
If O
it O
s O
that O
a O
single O
blood O
vessel O
is O
blocked O
, O
new O
ones O
are O
made O
all O
the O
time O
, O
contrary O
to O
the O
hypothesis O
, O
those O
veins O
should O
be O
able O
to O
function O
normally O
. O
Based O
on O
these O
pieces O
of O
evidence O
and O
others O
, O
it O
suggests O
to O
me O
that O
this O
is O
something O
that O
is O
highly O
unlikely O
. O
I O
m O
glad O
that O
this O
treatment O
worked O
for O
your O
wife O
and O
I O
hope O
it O
stays O
that O
way O
. O
But O
there O
is O
no O
science O
theoretical O
or O
clinical O
that O
suggest O
to O
most O
researchers O
that O
this O
is O
something O
that O
has O
more O
value O
to O
spend O
research O
funds O
on O
than O
other O
treatments O
. O

When O
my O
stones B-DIS
were O
stuck O
, O
it O
felt O
a O
lot O
like O
gas B-DIS
. O
I O
took O
Pepcid B-DRUG
, O
Nexium B-DRUG
, O
Tums B-DRUG
, O
you O
name O
it O
. O
I O
hope O
that O
s O
not O
what O
it O
is O
. O
Good O
luck O
and O
keep O
us O
updated O

I O
agree O
with O
the O
other O
comment O
to O
call O
your O
pharmacist O
. O
I O
just O
finished O
a O
round O
of O
antibiotics B-DRUG
and O
didn O
t O
notice O
anything O
. O
But O
I O
also O
only O
take O
my O
thyroid B-DIS
meds O
once O
a O
day O
so O
that O
s O
easier O
to O
schedule O

My O
father O
in O
law O
is O
in O
a O
memory O
care O
facility O
in O
California O
. O
He O
has O
recently O
become O
incontinent B-DIS
and O
has O
been O
non B-DIS
compliant I-DIS
in O
related O
areas O
at O
night O
. O
He O
will O
not O
change O
his O
clothes O
or O
try O
to O
pee O
at O
night O
, O
he O
is O
resistant B-DIS
if O
the O
staff O
find O
him O
wet O
at O
night O
and O
want O
to O
change O
his O
clothes O
, O
he O
is O
very O
angry B-DIS
when O
they O
check O
on O
him O
at O
night O
. O
Any O
experience O
or O
thoughts O
about O
this O
, O
I O
m O
assuming O
, O
pretty O
common O
scenario O
The O
staff O
is O
very O
nice O
and O
I O
know O
they O
try O
but O
they O
seem O
to O
be O
pretty O
ineffective O
at O
gaining O
compliance O
and O
seem O
to O
think O
he O
is O
unusually O
non O
complaint O
, O
which O
I O
have O
a O
hard O
time O
believing O
. O

Any O
update O
on O
your O
story O
yet O
I O
ve O
had O
two O
of O
these O
that O
I O
know O
of O
. O
The O
first O
was O
pretty O
bad O
. O
The O
second O
was O
a O
literal O
hell O
that O
lasted O
three O
days O
. O
Absolutely O
wrecked O
me O
. O
I O
welcomed O
morphine O
like O
it O
was O
nothing O
when O
I O
went O
to O
the O
ER O
which O
is O
really O
something O
because O
I O
usually O
don O
t O
do O
pain O
killers O
. O
But O
yeah O
it O
took O
a O
good O
while O
to O
pass O
, O
and O
even O
then O
it O
came O
out O
in O
fragments O
. O
But O
I O
will O
say O
that O
does O
seem O
to O
make O
it O
easier O
to O
pass O
, O
and O
here O
s O
what O
I O
did O
day O
3 O
, O
dad O
wanted O
to O
meet O
up O
and O
eat O
somewhere O
like O
I O
was O
in O
the O
mood O
for O
that O
lol O
but O
didn O
t O
want O
to O
be O
rude O
so O
we O
went O
and O
met O
him O
I O
saw O
lemoneade O
on O
the O
menu O
so O
I O
drank O
a O
ton O
of O
it O
and O
it O
I O
believe O
is O
what O
broke O
up O
the O
stone O
to O
tiny O
little O
bits O
. O
Hopefully O
this O
info O
helps O
you O
. O

My O
shots O
3 O
worked O
great O
for O
me O
as O
well O
, O
but O
that O
was O
three O
years O
ago O
now O
. O
So O
they O
are O
either O
still O
working O
or O
I O
am O
experiencing O
a O
burn B-DIS
out I-DIS
. O
I O
ve O
never O
heard O
of O
the O
sac O
decompression O
surgery O
What O
was O
your O
experience O
with O
it O
If O
you O
don O
t O
mind O
my O
asking O
. O

I O
no O
longer O
leak B-DIS
without O
knowing O
and O
the O
spasms B-DIS
only O
happen O
when O
I O
ve O
been O
holding O
onto O
my O
pee O
for O
hours O
. O
Accidents B-DIS
still O
happen O
, O
but O
it O
s O
not O
frequent O
anymore O
. O
I O
don O
t O
feel O
like O
I O
can O
t O
go O
anywhere O
because O
I O
will O
pee B-DIS
my I-DIS
pants I-DIS
. O

I O
understand O
their O
concern O
, O
since O
long-term O
use O
of O
benzos B-DRUG
for O
chronic B-DIS
pain I-DIS
has O
largely O
phased O
out O
of O
practice O
because O
of O
all O
the O
risks O
side O
effects O
. O
But O
you O
ve O
tried O
and O
failed O
other O
treatments O
, O
you O
re O
on O
a O
low O
dose O
, O
you O
re O
being O
monitored O
by O
a O
doctor O
, O
it O
works O
... O
why O
change O
Some O
doctors O
people O
will O
have O
knee-jerk O
condemnation O
of O
chronic O
use O
of O
painkillers O
in O
any O
patient O
for O
any O
reason O
. O
Nothing O
wrong O
with O
changing O
psychiatrists O
or O
gynecologists O
because O
they O
have O
preconceived O
notions O
about O
your O
treatment O
plan O
that O
might O
lead O
to O
worse O
care O
. O
Or O
at O
least O
telling O
them O
you O
re O
happy O
with O
your O
treatment O
plan O
and O
don O
t O
wish O
to O
discuss O
it O
with O
them O
. O
Don O
t O
get O
me O
started O
on O
psychiatrists O
who O
think O
IC O
pain O
is O
psychological O
. O
What O
is O
this O
, O
the O
1970s O

In O
answer O
of O
your O
questions O
A O
Start O
with O
the O
Alzheimer O
s O
Association O
at O
1.800.272.3900 O
; O
B O
If O
you O
call O
the O
GP O
, O
just O
know O
that O
he O
she O
will O
not O
divulge O
any O
of O
your O
Mom O
s O
information O
or O
even O
that O
she O
is O
his O
her O
patient O
, O
but O
there O
is O
no O
clause O
in O
HIPAA O
that O
restricts O
the O
GP O
from O
taking O
input O
from O
a O
patient O
s O
family O
. O
Tell O
him O
what O
you O
know O
and O
what O
your O
Mom O
s O
friends O
are O
telling O
you O
; O
and O
C O
Even O
though O
it O
might O
be O
a O
waste O
of O
breath O
, O
leave O
your O
uncle O
a O
message O
or O
write O
him O
a O
letter O
with O
your O
concerns O
and O
ask O
him O
to O
urge O
her O
to O
seek O
medical O
attention O
. O
While O
there O
is O
no O
cure O
for O
dementia B-DIS
, O
there O
are O
treatments O
to O
slow O
the O
progression O
and O
to O
reduce O
the O
accompanying O
anxiety B-DIS
and I-DIS
agitation I-DIS
. O

When O
I O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
, O
both O
my O
ears B-DIS
were I-DIS
affected I-DIS

Thanks O
for O
your O
story O
. O
I O
was O
just O
diagnosed O
and O
I O
m O
kinda O
freaking O
out O
about O
it O
... O
I O
appreciate O
your O
positive O
outlook O

gt O
; O
just O
depends O
on O
how O
I O
m O
feeling O
that O
day O
and O
if O
I O
end O
up O
being O
able O
to O
stomach O
that O
much O
salt O
. O
I O
had O
some O
problems O
early O
on O
with O
salting O
food O
or O
trying O
to O
eat O
it O
plain O
... O
but O
now O
I O
dissolve O
it O
into O
water O
and O
drink O
that O
throughout O
the O
day O
. O
No O
more O
stomachaches B-DIS
I O
used O
to O
drink O
a O
ton O
of O
water O
, O
up O
to O
5 O
liters O
a O
day O
, O
because O
I O
felt O
dehydrated B-DIS
all O
the O
time O
. O
Now O
, O
drinking O
salt O
water O
, O
I O
m O
down O
to O
only O
2 O
liters O
- O
a O
healthy O
amount O
- O
and O
feeling O
a O
lot O
better O
. O

Know O
more O
about O
what O
specifically O

With O
every O
single O
human O
action O
ever O
taken O
, O
there O
was O
a O
premium O
on O
doing O
it O
as O
opposed O
to O
doing O
something O
else O
. O
We O
don O
t O
need O
to O
think O
about O
constructs O
so O
impossible O
like O
a O
truly O
free O
market O
capitalism O
. O
Instead O
, O
to O
show O
that O
it O
applies O
across O
the O
board O
, O
we O
can O
look O
at O
early O
communism O
. O
I O
am O
talking O
about O
the O
pre-chiefdom O
period O
, O
so O
up O
to O
about O
3000BC O
. O
Think O
hunters O
and O
gatherers O
. O
There O
was O
no O
currency O
, O
religion O
was O
at O
its O
infancy O
- O
much O
too O
soon O
to O
form O
a O
government O
. O
And O
yet O
there O
was O
always O
a O
purchasing O
power O
of O
sorts O
. O
This O
purchasing O
power O
arose O
from O
goodwill O
. O
Members O
of O
the O
group O
would O
do O
what O
benefited O
their O
peers O
- O
hunting O
, O
gathering O
, O
early O
horticulture O
, O
bearing O
and O
raising O
children O
, O
tending O
to O
the O
wounded O
, O
early O
irrigation O
and O
other O
technical O
innovations O
. O
For O
this O
goodwill O
they O
would O
have O
the O
goodwill O
of O
others O
. O
There O
was O
a O
premium O
on O
certain O
actions O
and O
there O
were O
penalties O
for O
others O
. O
You O
could O
not O
put O
a O
nominal O
fine O
on O
thievery O
, O
but O
thevery O
could O
strip O
an O
individual O
of O
his O
purchasing O
power O
. O
It O
is O
not O
just O
impossible O
to O
not O
have O
incentives O
and O
disincentives O
in O
a O
market O
without O
a O
moderator O
, O
it O
is O
fundamentally O
impossible O
to O
not O
have O
social O
rewards O
on O
certain O
actions O
given O
human O
nature O
. O
Not O
having O
a O
moderator O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
there O
won O
t O
be O
moderating O
social O
forces O
. O
Those O
will O
always O
be O
present O
, O
as O
they O
always O
had O
been O
. O
But O
we O
can O
leave O
moderation O
up O
to O
the O
overall O
community O
, O
especially O
if O
it O
s O
well O
informed O
of O
the O
empirical O
status O
of O
the O
issue O
. O
As O
for O
regulation O
, O
I O
think O
unfair O
unenforceable O
regulation O
, O
or O
one O
that O
does O
not O
truly O
reflect O
the O
social O

norms O
of O
its O
constituents O
, O
leads O
to O
abuse O
. O
That O
is O
to O
say O
, O
we O
also O
can O
t O
go O

Thank O
you O
. O
I O
called O
my O
former O
supplier O
and O
they O
said O
they O
will O
take O
care O
of O
it O
. O
If O
that O
falls O
through O
, O
I O
will O
use O
your O
suggestion O
. O

My O
average O
temp O
is O
99.7 O
, O
often O
spikes O
to O
101 O
, O
my O
doctor O
told O
me O
not O
to O
be O
concerned O
until O
it O
doesn O
t O
come O
back O
down O
again O
after O
a O
decent O
amount O
of O
time O
or O
it O
hits O
102 O
. O

I O
have O
a O
remote O
control O
that O
I O
can O
use O
to O
turn O
the O
unit O
on O
or O
off O
, O
and O
adjust O
the O
voltage O
levels O
per O
my O
Doc O
s O
OK O
. O
My O
Medtronic O
representative O
they O
are O
there O
during O
your O
surgery O
, O
and O
a O
great O
resource O
later O
when O
you O
have O
questions O
has O
the O
fully O
hand O
held O
unit O
for O
diagnostics O
. O
It O
will O
read O
out O
what O
lead O
setting O
you O
are O
using O
one O
of O
four O
, O
the O

hence O
the O

A O
friend O
had O
near O
zero O
improvement O
from O
her O
DBS O
, O
but O
once O
working O
with O
her O
MDS O
and O
the O
Medtronic O
s O
rep O
they O
changed O
her O
settings O
from O
voltage O
to O
current O

. O
Suddenly O
her O
DBS O
was O
much O
more O
effective O
Jasmine O

a O
great O
YouTube O

on O
getting O
the O
most O
out O
of O

I O
suspect O
to O
learn O
more O
you O
d O
have O
to O
talk O
with O
a O
Medtronic O

Rep O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
never O

anything O

about O
all O
this O

Hence O

On O
the O

the O
cable O

are O
clearly O
seen O

Typically O
voltage O
is O
just O
applied O
to O
one O
of O
those O
four O

lots O

In O
fact O
my O
MS B-DIS
doctor O
suggested O
I O
didn O
t O
here O
in O
Canada O
as O
the O
majority O
of O
people O
who O
hear O
MS B-DIS
likely O
think O
you O
re O
not O
capable O
at O
being O
good O
at O
your O
job O
, O
or O
will O
be O
in O
long-term O
care O
any O
day O
now O
. O
Let O
s O
be O
honest O
, O
before O
the O
majority O
of O
us O
were O
diagnosed O
and O
unless O
we O
knew O
someone O
with O
it O
we O
likely O
thought O
the O
same O
thing O
. O
I O
agree O
about O
the O
if O
something O
happens O
comment O
, O
but O
I O
m O
not O
at O
that O
point O
yet O
. O
Maybe O
one O
day O
. O
Just O
my O
opinions O

Same O
in O
my O
state O
but O
a O
doctor O
put O
me O
in O
as O
having O
wasting B-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
which O
is O
covered O
since O
I O
need O
it O
to O
eat O
. O
If O
that O
is O
covered O
in O
your O
state O
give O
it O
a O

won O

like O

It O
s O
essentially O
sub B-DIS
clinical I-DIS
hypothyroidism I-DIS

You O
re O
thyroid B-DIS
is I-DIS
off I-DIS
, O
but O
not O
off O
enough O
to O
be O
treated O
by O
most O
mainstream O
doctors O
. O
If O
you O
feel B-DIS
like I-DIS
crap I-DIS

with O
numbers O

that O
I O
m O
sure O
you O

See O

Hey O
thanks O

I O

let O
him O
know O
He O
didn O
t O
say O
anything O
negative O
about O
it O
, O
just O
that O
it O
didn O
t O
seems O
to O
help O
wait O
, O
are O
we O
talking O
about O
weed B-DRUG
or O
cbd B-DRUG
oil I-DRUG
Either O
way O
, O
I O
ll O
pass O
on O
what O
you O
ve O
shared O
. O

Hey O
, O
I O
hope O
you O
re O
feeling O
better O
by O
now O
. O
I O
had O
the O
same O
reaction O
to O
MTX B-DRUG
after O
being O
10 O
years O
on O
it O
with O
some O
time O
off O
. O
My O
blood O
work O
also O
showed O
elevated B-DIS
AST I-DIS
, O
ALT B-DIS
. O
Overall O
, O
my O
liver O
was O
not O
doing O
well O
. O
My O
doc O
changed O
MTX B-DRUG
to O
a O
biologic B-DRUG
after O
some O
tests O
and O
thinking O
. O
My O
liver O
is O
fine O
now O
, O
no B-DIS
vomiting I-DIS
, O
no B-DIS
nausea I-DIS
. O
MTX B-DRUG
can O
be O
really O
hard O
on O
your O
body O
, O
and O
how O
will O
you O
handle O
it O
also O
depends O
on O
your O
body O
as O
a O
whole O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
were O
able O
to O
contact O
your O
doc O
and O
ask O
for O
advice O
. O
Just O
keep O
in O
mind O
, O
rheumy B-DIS
may O
not O
be O
too O
keen O
to O
change O
your O
main O
meds O
due O
to O
one O
time O
symptom O
. O
Chances O
are O
he O
or O
she O
will O
tell O
you O
to O
make O
another O
MTX B-DRUG
injection I-DRUG
and O
look O
out O
for O
the O
symptoms O
to O
reappear O
. O

IIRC O
, O
resmeds O
are O
24v O
and O
use O
a O
weird O
plug O
. O
I O
wouldn O
t O
try O
to O
hack O
something O
together O
unless O
you O
have O
the O
pinout O
for O
the O
plug O
and O
the O
right O
voltage O
power O
supply O
. O

The O
next O
day O
after O
taking O
flomax B-DRUG
for O
the O
first O
time O
I O
woke O
up O
with O
the O
worst O
headache B-DIS
EVERRRRR O
. O
It O
wore O
off O
after O
two O
days O
I O
believe O
. O
I O
did O
, O
however O
, O
then O
wake O
up O
with O
really O
stiff B-DIS
neck I-DIS
and O
shoulder B-DIS
issues I-DIS
... O
.I O
can O
not O
wait O
to O
be O
done O
with O
flomax B-DRUG
, O
oy O
vey O

Do O
you O
still O
have O
T B-DIS
Seems O
to O
be O
a O
complex O
condition O
with O
many O
different O
factors O
that O
the O
experts O
know O
little O
about O
too O
. O
My O
ENT O
charged O
me O
200 O
dollars O
to O
tell O
me O
what O
another O
Dr O
had O
already O
said O
Sensorineural B-DIS
hearing I-DIS
loss I-DIS
. O
It O
looks O
like O
it O
s O
up O
to O
us O
to O
learn O
the O
triggers O
and O
go O
through O
trial O
and O
error O
to O
see O
what O
reduces O
or O
eliminates O
it O
and O
you O
have O
hit O
the O
jackpot O
, O
no O
nicotine B-DRUG
no O
MD B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
, O
better O
health O
all O
round O
and O
if O
you O
ve O
quit O
for O
so O
long O
already O
then O
I O
think O
you O
ve O
pretty O
much O
beat O
the O
addiction O
too O
. O
Congrats O

she O
is O
older O
but O
lives O
with O
a O
freind O
my O
dad O
has O
autism B-DIS
so O
he O
has O
lots O
of O
anger B-DIS
problems I-DIS
hes O
a O
good O
dad O
in O
other O
ways O
but O
im O
fucked O
up O
perminatly O

Thanks O
, O
that O
s O
great O
information O

If O
you O
have O
prednisone B-DRUG
on O
hand O
you O

burst O

I O
take O
5 O
mg O
per O
day O
. O
In O
a O

I O
have O
heard O
that O
some O
people O
who O
don O
t O
normally O
take O
prednisone B-DRUG
have O
an O
emergency O
supply O
in O
case O
they O

Good O
luck O
. O
My O
partner O
has O
tried O
everything O
, O
including O
sleep O
she O
s O
plagued O
by O
insomnia B-DIS
, O
so O
no O
luck O
there O
, O
stimulants B-DRUG
of O
all O
sorts O
including O
schedule O
II O
prescriptions O
, O
vitamins B-DRUG
, O
healthy O
diet O
, O

... O
I O
wish O
we O
could O
find O
something O
. O
She O
d O
probably O
be O
able O
to O
start O
the O
career O
she O
s O
dreamed O
of O
if O
the O
fatigue B-DIS
could O
be O
controlled O
. O

By O
offset O
, O
do O
you O
mean O
just O
- O
a O
set O
number O
of O
hours O
depending O
on O
your O
timezone O
, O
or O
can O
you O
set O
an O
exact O
offset O
The O
problem O
with O
my O
old O
one O
was O
that O
it O
was O
25 O
minutes O
or O
so O
off O
. O
So O
setting O
the O
timezone O
didn O
t O
fix O
it O
. O
I O
couldn O
t O
find O
an O
option O
in O
sleepyhead O
to O
fix O
it O
, O
but O
I O
don O
t O
remember O
how O
hard O
I O
really O
looked O
. O
I O
just O
mentally O
adjusted O
the O
time O
until O
I O
switched O
to O
a O
ResMed O
. O

gt O
; O
Why O
doesn O
t O
anyone O
give O
these O
a O
try O
Because O
they O
re O
ineffective O
. O
You O
might O
be O
able O
to O
bench O
press O
400 O
pounds O
. O
But O
not O
while O
you O
re O
asleep O
. O
gt O
; O
There O
was O
a O
study O
done O
in O
the O
American O
journal O
of O
Respiratory O
and O
Critical O
Care O
Medicine O
and O
people O
who O
did O
this O
for O
30 O
minutes O
a O
day O
for O
3 O
months O
had O
a O
39 O
improvement O
in O
sleep O
quality O
... O
.for O
people O
with O
severe B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
I O
m O
sure O
39 O
percent O
would O
bring O
so O
much O
relief O
... O
that O
s O
only O
3 O
months O
, O
imagine O
after O
a O
year O
or O
two O
, O
the O
problem O
could O
potentially O
be O
reversed O
. O
It O
was O
a O
tiny O
study O
30 O
people O
done O
in O
Brazil O
and O
a O
quick O
googling O
doesn O
t O
show O
anybody O
else O
replicating O
their O
results O
. O
Also O
, O
even O
if O
it O
s O
real O
, O
for O
most O
people O
with O
apnea B-DIS
severe O
enough O
to O
impact O
their O
life O
, O
a O
39 O
improvement O
isn O
t O
really O
useful O
. O
They O
would O
still O
need O
treatment O
. O

This O
time O
my O
culture O
came O
back O
positive O
. O
I O
had O
a O
staph B-DIS
bacteria I-DIS
that O
didn O
t O
make O
nitrites O
, O
so O
the O
nitrite O
section O
was O
useless O
. O
I O
keep O
sample O
cups O
at O
my O
home O
and O
just O
drop O
them O
off O
at O
my O
Dr O
s O
office O
for O
a O
culture O
to O
save O
time O

You O
can O
get O

from O

Good O
point O
re O
cost O
of O
appliance O
vs O
cost O
of O
little O
CPAP B-DRUG
. O
Re O
efficacy O
, O
the O
dental O
office O
that O
offers O
the O
appliance O
in O
the O
op O
says O
they O
typically O
get O
a O
70-80 O
reduction O
in O
ahi B-DIS
. O
Since O
my O
ahi O
tested O
at O
24 O
, O
that O
reduction O
would O
be O
ok O
I O
think O
. O

It O
sounds O
like O
you O
have O
my O
exact O
symptoms O
from O
my O
start O
. O
If O
this O
is O
still O
early O
then O
you O
re O
miles O
ahead O
of O
most O
people O
. O
Make O
sure O
to O
take O
care O
of O
your O
body O
and O
be O
aggressive O

She O
is O
starting O
PT O
and O
Rock O
Steady O
Boxing O
this O
week O
Do O
you O
think O
speech O
therapy O
would O
be O
helpful O
if O
she O
isn O
t O
having O
any O
speech B-DIS
issues I-DIS
yet O
- O
is O
it O
preventative O

Thanks O
for O
following O
up O
You O
ve O
reassured O
me O
it O
won O
t O
be O
so O
bad O
. O
Sorry O
to O
hear O
you O
re O
in O
pain B-DIS
have O
you O
tried O
the O
Azo B-DRUG
Maximum I-DRUG
pain I-DRUG
relief I-DRUG
It O
s O
over O
the O
counter O
and O
numbs O
the O
urinary O
tract O
... O
it O
might O
give O
you O
some O
relief O
. O
I O
hope O
that O
feeling O
passes O
soon O
. O

Holy O
hell O
. O
I O
have O
a O
1.6cm B-DIS
stone O
still O
sitting O
in O
my O
kidney O
. O
My O
urologist O
is O
just O
watching O
it O
and O
doesn O
t O
want O
to O
do O
anything O
unless O
it O
moves O
. O
It O
s O
been O
sitting O
there O
for O
3 O
years O
now O
. O
If O
it O
ever O
moves O
, O
he O
said O
he O
would O
do O
surgery O
. O
I O
am O
not O
looking O
forward O
to O
that O
day O
. O

I O
am O
only O
taking O
the O
supplement O
because O
I O
also O
have O
IBS B-DIS
and O
the O
list O
says O
to O
avoid O
nuts O
. O
I O
plan O
to O
test O
em O
out O
though O
because O
some O
nuts O
may O
be O
fine O
with O
me O
. O
The O
extreme O
limitation O
in O
my O
diet O
is O
due O
to O
have O
IBS B-DIS
IC B-DIS
and O
pcos B-DIS
which O
cuts O
out O
starchy O
veggies O
, O
refined O
carbs O
, O
sugar O
. O
Blegh O
. O

Changes O
in O
IBS B-DIS
are O
gradual O
. O
If O
you O
are O
experiencing O
a O
sudden O
onset O
of O
symptoms O
, O
you O
need O
to O
see O
a O
doctor O
just O
like O
you O
would O
if O
you O
didn O
t O
have O
IBS B-DIS
and O
started O
seeing B-DIS
mucus I-DIS
and I-DIS
blood I-DIS
. O

Keep O
fighting O
for O
it O
. O
You O
will O
find O
a O
doctor O
that O
will O
prescribe O
it O
. O

I O
use O
baby B-DRUG
shampoo I-DRUG
in O
between O
the O
days O
I O
use O
t-gel B-DRUG
. O
Or O
just O
not O
wash O
in-between O
. O

Wow O
, O
that O
sucks O
. O
It O
sounds O
like O
your O
boss O
is O
a O
shitty O
manager O
who O
needs O
to O
be O
hauled O
into O
HR O
and O
I O
hope O
you O
can O
get O
some O
satisfaction O
. O
Beyond O
that O
, O
given O
the O
grueling O
schedule O
you O
mentioned O
, O
perhaps O
this O
isn O
t O
the O
right O
job O
for O
you O
I O
would O
have O
a O
tough O
time O
on O
that O
schedule O
even O
if O
I O
didn O
t O
have O
a O
sleep B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
. O
Also O
, O
for O
most O
of O
us O
, O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
never O
goes O
away O
. O
All O
it O
takes O
is O
one O
night O
with O
a O
leaky O
mask O
, O
a O
power O
failure O
, O
or O
rain O
out O
and O
you O
re O
a O
zombie O
the O
next O
day O
. O
It O
would O
seem O
that O
sleep B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
is O
incompatible O
with O
your O
current O
schedule O
. O
Perhaps O
this O
is O
an O
opportunity O
to O
request O
a O
different O
schedule O
, O
especially O
since O
you O
d O
probably O
get O
some O
help O
from O
HR O
trying O
to O
cover O
for O
that O
shitty O
manager O

Even O
though O
I O
m O
64 O
and O
have O
never O
played O
video O
games O
, O
Pokemon O
Go O
has O
kept O
me O
walking O
much O
more O
than O
I O
did O
before O
. O
I O
m O
kind O
of O
a O
tenacious O
person O
, O
so O
I O
m O
bound O
and O
determined O
to O
catch O
them O
all O
lol O
. O
It O
s O
something O
to O
engage O
me O
, O
get O
me O
outside O
, O
keep O
me O
going O
on O
those O
days O
when O
I O
d O
rather O
stay O
in O
bed O
. O
And O
it O
s O
free O

Yea O
I O
have O
a O
0 O
copay O
for O
Otezla B-DRUG
but O
when O
I O
check O
my O
insurance O
they O
are O
being O
billed O
around O
2600 O
a O
month O
. O
Glad O
I O
have O
insurance O

okay O
, O
well O
thats O
good O
to O
hear O
as O
a O
comparison O
. O
Thanks O
for O
the O
info O

Does O
it O
come O
back O
if O
you O
stop O
using O
the O
Head O
and O
Shoulders O

You O
ll O
actually O
be O
awake O
more O
after O
exercising O
. O
I O
m O
trying O
to O
force O
myself O
to O
go O
back O
but O
can O
t O
take O
the O
first O
leap O

For O
the O
most O
part O
, O
people O
with O
RERA B-DIS
are O
young O
, O
not O
obese O
and O
female O
. O
The O
reverse O
is O
true O
for O
OSA B-DIS
with O
older O
, O
middle-aged O
men O
on O
the O
heavier O
end O
of O
the O
weight O
scale O
predominantly O
plagued O
with O
this O
condition O
. O
In O
addition O
, O
RERA B-DIS
sufferers O
are O
more O
likely O
to O
also O
have O
**chronic O
insomnia** O
. O
When O
I O
was O
going O
to O
sleep O
a O
couple O
hours O
past O
midnight O
sometimes O
I O
would O
still O
feel O
sleepy O
around O
10pm O
. O
I O
quickly O
learned O
that O
if O
I O
actually O
did O
go O
to O
sleep O
early O
I O
would O
wake O
up O
in O
a O
couple O
hours O
and O
not O
be O
able O
to O
fall O
asleep O
until O
around O
9am O
or O
later O
. O
In O
the O
5 O
years O
that O
I O
ve O
suffered O
with O
this O
I O
would O
say O
I O
only O
napped O
a O
handful O
of O
times O
. O
I O
also O
wake O
up O
way O
too O
early O
for O
how O
much O
hours O
of O
sleep O
I O
actually O
need O
. O
For O
example O
around O
8 O
instead O
of O
the O
12 O
that O
people O
mention O
a O
lot O
that O
they O
need O
to O
function O
at O
all O
. O
I O
wake O
up O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
and O
can O
t O
fall O
asleep O
quickly O
and O
it O
might O
take O
me O
up O
to O
30 O
minutes O
to O
fall O
asleep O
again O
. O
It O
s O
not O
the O
mask O
keeping O
me O
up O
since O
I O
got O
lucky O
with O
it O
and O
didn O
t O
even O
have O
a O
problem O
wearing O
it O
the O
first O
night O
. O
I O
ve O
also O
stayed O
up O
for O
a O
long O
time O
but O
I O
used O
caffeine O
. O
I O
think O
it O
was O
around O
32 O
hours O
just O
to O
see O
if O
anything O
would O
happen O
. O
Besides O
getting O
my O
pulse O
to O
165 O
and O
then O
only O
sleeping O
for O
8 O
hours O
I O
felt O
exactly O
the O
same O
, O
meaning O
like O
death O
. O
That O
was O
without O
cpap O
but O
right O
now O
I O
still O
feel O
the O
same O
with O
an O
AHI O
of O
1.36 O
. O
There O
were O
also O
times O
where O
I O
would O

have O
to O
tire O
myself O
out O
and O
feel O
like O
I O
haven O
t O
slept O
for O
24 O
hours O
even O
though O
it O
was O
probably O
just O
a O
little O
bit O
over O
12 O
just O
to O
be O
able O
to O
fall O
asleep O
. O

I O
understand O
it O
s O
status O
as O
an O
umbrella O
term O
for O
like O
symptoms O
so O
I O
am O
not O
frustrated O
with O
it O
*not* O
being O
MD O
rather O
than O
I O
am O
with O
the O
ambiguity O
that O
comes O
with O
the O
territory O
. O
Which O
I O
imagine O
is O
something O
every O
one O
must O
go O
through O
. O
I O
just O
wish O
I O
could O
nail O
down O
some O
sort O
of O
treatment O
or O
lifestyle O
habit O
that O
mitigates O
these O
but O
they O
all O
have O
come O
up O
. O
Luckily O
mine O
have O
yet O
to O
get O
too O
frequent O
. O
I O
have O
had O
an O
MRI O
in O
the O
past O
in O
the O
early O
stages O
of O
looking O
for O
treatment O
but O
they O
didn O
t O
show O
anything O
. O
I O
don O
t O
even O
remember O
it O
s O
purpose O
though O
. O
What O
do O
you O
think O
an O
MRI O
could O
would O
show O

Happy O
ms-iversary O
Not O
the O
most O
fun O
celebration O
, O
but O
I O
hope O
you O
do O
something O
nice O
for O
yourself O
to O
commemorate O
it O
. O
Take O
care O
. O

It O
ll O
be O
a O
day O
and O
night O
feeling O
no O
pun O
intended O
but O
you O
ll O
feel O
so O
rested B-DIS
when O
you O
wake O
up O
after O
using O
your O
BIPAP B-DRUG
machine O
you O
ll O
wonder O
how O
you O
did O
without O
it O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
the O
advice O
. O
I O
was O
reading O
some O
people O
saying O
that O
Dead O
Sea O
mineral O
salts O
help O
if O
you O
soak O
in O
it O
a O
few O
times O
a O
week O
. O
I O
don O
t O
think O
I O
m O
going O
on O
a O
trip O
to O
Israel O
anytime O
soon O
so O
I O
will O
place O
an O
order O
online O
asap O
. O

Really O
30 O
years O
is O
rare O
My O
dad O
has O
had O
it O
for O
45 O
years O
, O
but O
was O
only O
diagnosed O
around O
15 O
years O
ago O
. O

Up O
until O
the O
past O
few O
months O
, O
ibuprofen B-DRUG
with I-DRUG
codiene I-DRUG
worked O
really O
well O
. O
I O
did O
really O
love O
hot O
water O
bottles O
, O
but O
unfortunately O
I O
was O
starting O
to O
ruin O
the O
skin O
on O
my O
stomach O
amp O
; O
thighs O
. O

I O
really O
hope O
thats O
the O
case O
, O
and O
I O
still O
really O
would O
like O
this O
machine O
to O
work O
It O
feels O
like O
I O
technically O
slept O
, O
but O
had O
next O
to O
zero O
REM O
sleep O
. O
Takes O
me O
back O
to O
the O
University O
days O
, O
but O
without O
the O
project O
or O
deadline O
excitement O
. O
Or O
the O
night O
my O
kid O
was O
born O
, O
which O
involved O
being O
woken O
every O
15 O
minutes O
for O
10 O
hours O
. O
I O
find O
it O
really O
hard O
to O
believe O
this O
is O
in O
any O
way O
good O
sleep O
, O
but O
the O
fact O
it O
got O
better O
for O
you O
at O
least O
gives O
some O
hope O

That O
s O
really O
cool O

Thank O
you O
I O
will O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
joining O
an O
exercise O
group O
or O
doing O
something O
a O
little O
more O
social O

weird O
, O
but O
I O
m O
glad O
you O
don O
t O
have O
to O
be O
weighed O
down O
by O
it O
a O
bad O

Thank O
you O
, O
you O
ve O
helped O
me O
calm O
down O
and O
be O
able O
to O
try O
and O
get O
some O
sleep O
. O

PM O
me O
am O
sure O
we O
can O
work O
something O
out O

It O
s O
different O
for O
everyone.. O
personally O
if O
I O
diet O
for O
6 O
months O
then O
I O
can O
usually O
return O
to O
eating O
whatever O
I O
want O
. O
A O
flare B-DIS
for O
me O
usually O
lasts O
a O
week O
. O
If O
you O
re O
only O
having O
pain B-DIS
in I-DIS
the I-DIS
mornings I-DIS
then O
that O
doesn O
t O
sound O
too O
bad O
. O
It O
s O
up O
to O
you O
. O
You O
could O
maybe O
get O
away O
with O
spicy O
stuff O
, O
the O
most O
harmful O
things O
are O
the O
acidic O
stuff O
tomato O
sauce O
coffee O
. O
The O
bladder O
won O
t O
break O
down O
, O
you O
just O
might O
flare B-DIS
more O
in O
which O
case O
you O
d O
just O
have O
to O
cut O
back O
a O
bit O
. O
I O
ve O
found O
that O
my O
bladder O
is O
pretty O
okay O
with O
hard O
alcohol O
I O
drink O
whisky O
, O
vodka O
s O
even O
safer O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
heard O
beer O
is O
more O
flaring B-DIS
. O
Sex O
depends O
on O
the O
person.. O
for O
me O
sex O
doesn O
t O
harm O
anything O
, O
sometimes O
the O
orgasm O
even O
helps O
. O
If O
the O
pain B-DIS
doesn O
t O
bother O
you O
that O
much O
then O
continue O
eating O
however O
you O
want O
. O
Just O
cut O
back O
if O
the O
pain B-DIS
gets O
too O
much O
for O
you O
. O

Put O
the O
pressure B-DIS
back O
where O
it O
was O
. O
If O
that O
doesn O
t O
fix O
it O
, O
bring O
it O
in O
to O
have O
it O
checked O
. O

I O
kept O
thinking O
that O
my O
running O
shoes O
needed O
to O
be O
replaced O
bc O
my O
toes O
bilaterally O
hurt O
so O
badly O
. O
I O
bought O
new O
shoes O
, O
then O
another O
pair O
, O
then O
another O
pair O
... O
then O
when O
my O
hands B-DIS
, O
wrists B-DIS
, O
and B-DIS
neck I-DIS
began I-DIS
to I-DIS
hurt I-DIS
, O
I O
knew O
it O
wasn O
t O
the O
shoes O
. O
My O
rheum O
says O
bilateral O
is O
the O
key O
. O

Hi O
fellow O
RA B-DIS
runner O
Find O
the O
right O
balance O
- O
when O
my O
knees B-DIS
hurt I-DIS
I O
give O
myself O
an O
extra O
day O
off O
or O
run O
a O
little O
slower O
or O
less O
the O
next O
time O
. O
But O
I O
consistently O
run O
each O
week O
and O
it O
s O
the O
best O
stress O
reliever O
for O
me O
- O
and O
it O
keeps O
my O
muscles O
lungs O
in O
shape O

I O
would O
recommend O
pushing O
back O
on O
Cigna O
some O
. O
I O
also O
have O
Cigna O
, O
and O
got O
my O
sleep O
study O
covered O
. O
Take O
a O
look O
at O
their O
guidelines O
and O
talk O
to O
your O
physician O
about O
what O
information O
they O
need O
. O
For O
starters O
, O
they O
need O
documentation O
that O
you O
have O
excessive B-DIS
daytime I-DIS
sleepiness I-DIS
and O
symptoms O
risk O
factors O
for O
OSA B-DIS
which O
it O
sounds O
like O
you O
do O
. O
To O
cover O
the O
in-office O
study O
, O
they O
will O
additionally O
need O
clinical O
documentation O
to O
support O
a O
possible O
central B-DIS
apnea I-DIS
or O
other O
sleep B-DIS
disorder I-DIS
it O
s O
not O
just O
a O
suspicion O
, O
but O
they O
will O
need O
actual O
clinical O
data O
from O
your O
physician O
or O
documentation O
that O
your O
take O
home O
study O
was O
technically O
inadequate O
. O
There O
are O
other O
indications O
for O
an O
in-office O
sleep O
study O
, O
but O
probably O
don O
t O
apply O
to O
you O
since O
you O
already O
had O
a O
take-home O
study O
. O
Don O
t O
discount O
the O
home O
study O
too O
much O
. O
While O
they O
won O
t O
pick O
up O
on O
non-OSA B-DIS
disorders I-DIS
or O
central B-DIS
sleep I-DIS
apnea I-DIS
, O
these O
are O
pretty O
rare O
. O
They O
do O
provide O
very O
good O
data O
on O
apneic B-DIS
episodes I-DIS
and O
can O
diagnose O
OSA B-DIS
. O
My O
concern O
would O
be O
that O
your O
oral O
device O
might O
not O
be O
the O
right O
therapy O
for O
you O
and O
there O
isn O
t O
a O
great O
way O
to O
measure O
it O
s O
effectiveness O
. O
With O
CPAP B-DRUG
, O
you O
can O
get O
data O
out O
of O
the O
device O
to O
know O
if O
you O
are O
still O
having O
apneic B-DIS
episodes O
or O
not O
. O
If O
you O
use O
CPAP O
, O
it O
works O
very O
few O
apneic O
hyponeic B-DIS
events I-DIS
and O
you O
still O
have O
sleepiness B-DIS
, O
then O
that O
can O
point O
towards O
other O
sleep O
illnesses O
being O
the O
problem O
. O
And O
if O
you O
use O
CPAP O
but O
the O
data O
shows O
large O
periods O
of O
apnea B-DIS
, O
then O
you O
know O
that O
central O
apnea O
is O
a O
problem O
. O
**TL O
; O
DR O
Arm O
yourself O
with O
insurance O
information O
and O
fight O
. O
But O
also O
look O

at O
getting O
a O
CPAP O
machine O
and O
using O
that O
data O
. O
** O

We O
haven O
t O
had O
hot O
days O
yet O
only O
a O
couple O
of O
nice O
warm O
spring O
days O
. O
I O
am O
already O
dreading O
the O
heat O
of O
summer O
yet O
I O
am O
happy O
to O
the O
snow O
go O
too O
. O
Ah O
, O
mother O
nature O
, O
it O
is O
complicated O
. O

Thanks O
for O
the O
very O
thoughtful O
response O
. O
This O
is O
all O
very O
helpful O
. O

I O
had O
one O
a O
month O
and O
a O
half O
ago O
. O
The O
lady O
that O
started O
it O
right O
before O
me O
got O
to O
go O
at O
2 O
hours O
because O
her O
stomach O
emptied O
quickly O
. O
At O
3 O
hours O
I O
was O
told O
it O
looked O
like O
I O
just O
ate O
so O
I O
had O
to O
stay O
for O
4 O
. O
I O
d O
ask O
the O
gastroenterologist O
to O
see O
what O
they O
found O
and O
discuss O
your O
concerns O
with O
them O
. O

This O
is O
so O
me O

Makes O
me O
irrationally B-DIS
angry I-DIS
and I-DIS
disdainful I-DIS
to O
just O
about O
everything O
in O
my O
life O
. O
To O
a O
point O
where O
I O
d O
kill O
myself O
just O
to O
spite O
others O
... O
. O

This O
happened O
after O
I O
got O
POTS B-DIS
-- O
my O
endocrinologist O
diagnosed O
it O
as O
reactive B-DIS
hypoglycemia I-DIS
after O
doing O
a O
multi-hour O
blood O
glucose O
test O
. O
She O
prescribed O
a O
**low-glycemic O
, O
high-protein O
diet** O
, O
and O
inevitably O
, O
following O
those O
guidelines O
helped O
more O
than O
anything O
else O
. O
It O
s O
important O
to O
remember O
that O
glycemic O
index O
how O
quickly O
sugar O
enters O
the O
bloodstream O
is O
related O
to O
*how* O
food O
is O
prepared O
-- O
not O
just O
the O
type O
of O
food O
. O
The O
longer O
you O
cook O
pasta O
, O
for O
example O
, O
the O
higher O
the O
glycemic O
value O
but O
you O
won O
t O
want O
to O
be O
eating O
wheat O
, O
regardless O
; O
see O
below O
. O
Blending O
fruit O
into O
juice O
regardless O
of O
whether O
there O
s O
pulp O
causes O
the O
sugar O
to O
be O
absorbed O
right O
away O
, O
but O
eating O
raw O
fruit O
allows O
the O
fiber O
and O
cellulose O
to O
slow O
the O
rate O
of O
absorption O
. O
I O
ve O
also O
noticed O
that O
avoiding O
wheat O
gluten O
helps O
, O
probably O
because O
it O
is O
similar O
to O
insulin O
in O
triggering O
muscle O
cells O
to O
absorb O
more O
sugar O
from O
the O
bloodstream O
and O
consequently O
cause O
hypoglycemia B-DIS
. O
Edit O
I O
should O
mention O
that O
it O
wasn O
t O
a O
full O
on O
loss B-DIS
of I-DIS
consciousness I-DIS
, O
but O
rather O
symptoms O
of O
hypoglycemia B-DIS
such O
as O
lightheadedness B-DIS
, O
brain B-DIS
fog I-DIS
, O
fatigue B-DIS
, O
etc O
. O

Very O
sorry O
for O
your O
loss O

I O
was O
diagnosed O
in O
1991 O
. O
It O
took O
many O
years O
of O
trial O
and O
error O
, O
but O
I O
ve O
managed O
to O
find O
a O
diet O
that O
works O
really O
well O
for O
me O
vegan O
, O
low O
fat O
and O
thankfully O
live O
where O
marijuana O
is O
legal O
and O
high O
CBD O
tinctures O
help O
me O
keep O
pain B-DIS
in O
an O
acceptable O
baseline O
level O
. O
Since O
about O
2002 O
I O
ve O
had O
fewer O
trips O
to O
the O
hospital O
than O
I O
did O
any O
year O
in O
the O
decade O
before O
, O
and O
I O
ve O
become O
much O
better O
about O
pain B-DIS
management O
, O
including O
taking O
two O
mindfulness O
meditation O
courses O
targeting O
pain B-DIS
and O
anxiety B-DIS
. O
I O
think O
I O
would O
tell O
someone O
in O
your O
position O
that O
you O
still O
have O
a O
lot O
of O
options O
to O
explore O
, O
and O
depending O
on O
where O
you O
live O
and O
what O
your O
insurance O
situation O
is O
like O
I O
would O
hope O
that O
the O
desperation O
you O
can O
sometimes O
feel O
could O
be O
channeled O
as O
a O
motivation O
to O
try O
new O
, O
even O
unorthodox O
approaches O
I O
felt O
silly O
going O
to O
an O
acupuncturist O
, O
and O
I O
don O
t O
think O
it O
helped O
with O
the O
pain O
directly O
but O
it O
was O
a O
very O
calming O
and O
comfortable O
experience O
that O
led O
me O
to O
the O
mindfulness O
meditation O
courses O
at O
the O
same O
clinic O
. O

Your O
actions O
will O
not O
have O
the O
desired O
outcome O
. O
A O
person O
with O
BPD B-DIS
would O
not O
likely O
appreciate O
an O
ex O
giving O
that O
opinion O
. O

I O
m O
a O
24 O
year O
old O
female O
, O
and O
I O
always O
appreciate O
having O
new O
friends O
Bonus O
points O
if O
they O
have O
these O
crappy O
diseases O
heh O
. O
PM O
me O
if O
you O
want O
to O
exchange O
info O

gt O
; O
Do O
bpds B-DIS
care O
when O
they O
do O
this O
to O
someone O
Depends O
on O
the O
person O
. O
What O
s O
going O
on O
is O
likely O
something O
called O
splitting B-DIS
, O
in O
which O
a O
person O
with O
BPD B-DIS
alternates O
between O
phases O
of O
idealization O
and O
demonization O
of O
a O
person O
. O
Sometimes O
they O
don O
t O
care O
, O
or O
even O
remember O
. O
This O
will O
probably O
happen O
again O
in O
the O
future O
if O
you O
stay O
together O
, O
provided O
she O
hasn O
t O
cut O
you O
out O
entirely O
. O

I O
could O
never O
drag O
that O
into O
the O
bathroom O
, O
though O
. O
Too O
many O
germs O
. O

Can O
you O
control O
when O
amp O
; O
where O
you O
release O
, O
or O
is O
it O
becoming O
a O
control O
problem O
We O
all O
stink O
. O

Elmiron B-DRUG
doesn O
t O
have O
any O
bad O
side O
effects O
except O
making O
you O
lose B-DIS
some I-DIS
hair I-DIS
and O
making O
IBS B-DIS
worse I-DIS
if O
you O
have O
that O
. O
I O
never O
experienced O
the O
side O
effects O
, O
but O
I O
have O
so O
much O
hair O
I O
didn O
t O
care O
anyway O
. O
Elmiron B-DRUG
in O
the O
end O
did O
nothing O
for O
me O
, O
but O
I O
didn O
t O
lose O
anything O
suffer O
either O
. O
If O
its O
in O
your O
price O
range O
can O
be O
expensive O
I O
don O
t O
see O
why O
not O
. O

But O
I O
am O
seeing O
a O
doctor O
. O
Also O
I O
meant O
that O
it O
helps O
with O
chronic B-DIS
pain I-DIS
not O
that O
it O
s O
gon O
na O
magically O
cure O
my O
gut O
Look O
up O
medical B-DRUG
marijuana I-DRUG
in O
this O
sub O
, O
read O
about O
how O
it O
helps O
people O
, O
but O
most O
importantly O
calm O
the O
fuck O
down O
lmao O

No-Spa B-DRUG
has O
no O
side O
effect O
. O
I O
was O
on O
opiates B-DRUG
for O
backpain B-DIS
and O
didn O
t O
shit O
for O
6 O
days O
. O

Oh O
gotcha O
. O
Yeah O
, O
I O
m O
used O
to O
having O
a O
resting O
heart O
rate O
in O
the O
low O
40 O
s O
to O
mid O
30 O
s. O
So O
I O
m O
sure O
I O
ll O
be O
fine O
. O

I O
ve O
had O
multiple O
journals O
over O
the O
years O
, O
starting O
in O
2012 O
. O
I O
mostly O
just O
vent O
in O
them O
about O
whatever O
is O
bothering O
me O
, O
so O
there O
s O
almost O
never O
anything O
happy O
in O
them O
. O
I O
started O
the O
first O
one O
to O
write O
about O
the O
abusive O
relationship O
I O
was O
in O
, O
it O
was O
all O
kinds O
of O
fucked O
up O
when O
I O
reread O
my O
stuff O
I O
can O
see O
that O
but O
I O
like O
seeing O
the O
improvements O
in O
myself O
. O
I O
think O
in O
total O
I O
have O
4 O
journals O
... O
when O
I O
stop O
writing O
in O
one O
, O
instead O
of O
picking O
it O
back O
up O
where O
I O
left O
off O
I O
buy O
a O
new O
one O
. O
I O
like O
it O
that O
way O
because O
each O
book O
is O
like O
a O
chapter O
. O
I O
also O
write O
so O
maybe O
if O
I O
m O
dead O
someone O
will O
be O
able O
to O
better O
understand O
what O
I O
was O
going O
through O
. O
When O
I O
was O
in O
a O
crisis O
stabilization O
unit O
each O
time O
for O
2 O
weeks O
I O
wrote O
every O
single O
day O
. O
Stuff O
like O
the O
quote O
of O
the O
day O
, O
planning O
for O
family O
therapy O
, O
complaining O
about O
the O
other O
clients O
, O
or O
whatever O
funny O
stuff O
went O
on O
too O
. O

stop O
cyber O
stalking O
me O
and O
trolling O
me O
, O
you O
re O
a O
weirdo O
, O
go O
away O
. O

I O
experience O
difficulties B-DIS
with I-DIS
sensory I-DIS
processing I-DIS
in O
general O
as O
a O
result O
of O
my O
dysautonomia B-DIS
. O
The O
autonomic O
nervous O
system O
plays O
a O
role O
in O
more O
things O
than O
many O
people O
realize O
, O
one O
of O
them O
being O
hearing O
. O
In O
my O
research O
, O
I O
even O
found O
an O
article O
from O
back O
in O
1981 O
where O
dysfunction B-DIS
of I-DIS
the I-DIS
autonomic I-DIS
nervous I-DIS
system I-DIS
was O
found O
to O
cause O
hearing B-DIS
loss I-DIS
, O
which O
isn O
t O
exactly O
the O
same O
as O
what O
we O
re O
dealing O
with O
, O
but O
to O
me O
indicates O
that O
it O
s O
likely O
a O
similar O
issue O
. O

Any O
kind O
of O
processed O
meat O
. O
Guaranteed O
to O
shut B-DIS
down I-DIS
my I-DIS
stomach I-DIS
within O
an O
hour O
of O
consuming O
it O
. O
During O
a O
flare B-DIS
like O
right O
now O
anything O
solid O
is O
a O
no O
no O
. O

They O
can O
prescribe O
meds O
that O
help O
ease O
the O
Vertigo B-DIS
and O
sick B-DIS
feeling I-DIS
but O
it O
does O
not O
stop O
it O
entirely O
. O
I O
take O
Betahistine B-DRUG
3 O
times O
a O
day O
and O
I O
have O
just O
gotten O
over O
a O
monstrous O
Vertigo B-DIS
and O
migraine B-DIS
attack I-DIS
... O
but O
it O
was O
my O
first O
in O
many O
months O
. O
In O
between O
times O
I O
am O
fine O
. O
Everyone O
if O
affected O
differently O
. O
For O
me O
as O
a O
female O
and O
in O
my O
specific O
situation O
I O
appear O
to O
be O
a O
little O
more O
prone O
when O
I O
have O
my O
period O
which O
is O
also O
unpredictable O
so O
I O
can O
t O
even O
say O
that O
once O
a O
month O
I O
have O
to O
prepare O
for O
an O
attack O
I O
also O
have O
mid B-DIS
tone I-DIS
deafness I-DIS
apparently O
it O
s O
rather O
odd O
and O
I O
have O
tinnitus B-DIS
in O
both O
ears O
24 O
7 O
. O
There O
are O
other O
medications O
and O
treatments O
that O
other O
users O
on O
here O
have O
tried O
so O
it O
might O
pay O
to O
have O
a O
look O
through O
the O
previous O
posts O
as O
well O
. O
Good O
luck O
and O
hope O
you O
recover O
from O
this O
latest O
batch O
soon O

This O
might O
be O
the O
wrong O
answer O
to O
your O
question O
. O
But O
I O
use O
an O
app O
called O
Life360 O
which O
I O
installed O
on O
my O
mothers O
phone O
and O
my O
own O
, O
it O
tells O
me O
when O
she O
leaves O
and O
arrives O
home O
. O

I O
m O
sorry O
to O
hear O
that O
. O
I O
know O
the O
feeling O
. O
It O
s O
tough O
to O
be O
happy O
for O
others O
when O
it O
s O
all O
you O
ever O
wanted O
for O
yourself O
. O
Hang O
in O
there O
. O
Try O
to O
think O
of O
something O
that O
you O
can O
do O
today O
to O
brighten O
this O
day O
at O
least O
- O
a O
nap O
, O
a O
walk O
, O
a O
call O
to O
a O
friend O
or O
just O
binge O
a O
Tv O
show O
. O
Whatever O
makes O
things O
feel O
better O
. O

I O
take O
a O
Hemp O
Protein O
powder O
can O
t O
do O
whey O
as O
I O
have O
issues O
with O
dairy O
that O
seems O
to O
cut O
the O
duration O
of O
my O
PEM B-DIS
crashes I-DIS
in O
half O
. O
I O
ve O
tried O
lots O
of O
other O
supplements B-DRUG
but O
nothing O
else O
has O
had O
any O
effect O
. O

OMG.. O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
at O
27- O
had O
to O
quit O
working O
a O
decade O
later O
and O
now O
, O
a O
failed O
marriage O
and O
poverty O
later O
my O
family O
doesn O
t O
believe O
me O
either O
. O
Exact O
same O
mentality O
. O
My O
father O
stopped O
talking O
to O
me O
almost O
a O
year O
ago O
while O
I O
get O
my O
shit O
together O
it O
s O
so O
fucking O
frustrating O
I O
can O
very O
much O
relate O

I O

Kleenex B-DRUG

That O
s O
really O
nice O
to O
read O
, O
in O
a O
bittersweet O
kind O
of O
way O
. O
Thanks O
for O
this O
anecdote O
and O
talking O
about O
gratitude O
, O
it O
s O
helped O
me O
feel O
better O
after O
what O
s O
been O
a O
horrible O
CFS B-DIS
day O
. O

Ok O
fair O
enough O
. O
I O
really O
should O
start O
working O
out O
. O

Likewise O
, O
but O
we O
re O
talking O
about O
two O
different O
diseases O
. O

How O
does O

your O

Hey O
That O
s O
not O
a O
bad O
idea O
Crafts O

a O
good O
call O

Does O
seniorsmatter.com O
pay O
you O
to O
post O
these O

That O
s O
all O
you O
post O
. O
How O
about O
joining O
in O
the O
discussion O

Yeah O
... O
. O
definitely O
hasn O
t O
been O
a O
good O
night O
lol O
. O
I O
think O
it O
s O
almost O
over O
though O
. O

This O
is O
a O
hard O
spot O
and O
I O
understand O
you O
feel O
because O
I O
ve O
been O
hurt O
many O
times O
. O
Even O
if O
it O
s O
perceived O
it O
s O
still O
valid O
. O
Recently O
though O
I O
ve O
figured O
out O
mostly O
I O
m O
wrong O
in O
my O
perceptions O
. O
Like O
dead O
wrong O
So O
when O
I O
m O
offended O
about O
something O
, O
the O
reality O
usually O
is O
that O
the O
persons O
actions O
had O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
me O
, O
at O
all O
. O
Our O
friends O
are O
in O
a O
tough O
spot O
. O
They O
may O
want O
to O
validate O
us O
. O
But O
how O
do O
they O
validate O
something O
that O
they O
know O
is O
being O
perceived O
completely O
wrong O
This O
situation O
may O
be O
different O
, O
I O
m O
just O
sharing O
what O
I O
m O
learning O
now O
. O
But O
know O
this O
... O
people O
are O
self O
obsessed O
and O
ego O
centric O
and O
90 O
of O
the O
time O
they O
re O
so O
not O
thinking O
about O
us O
at O
all O

I O
think O
I O
read O
somewhere O
that O
the O
issue O
is O
in O
glycolysis B-DIS
which O
actually O
occurs O
in O
the O
cytoplasm O
rather O
than O
the O
krebs O
Cycle O
. O
That O
there O
isn O
t O
enough O
ATP O
being O
produced O
in O
the O
krebs O
and O
the O
oxidative O
phosphorylation O
stage O
and O
excess O
lactate O
indicating O
glycolysis O
occurring O
under O
anaerobic O
conditions O
for O
some O
reason O
.. O

I O
looked O
up O
why O
your O
grandma O
wants O
to O
eat O
meat O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
find O
anything O
about O
that O
, O
but O
this O
page O
talks O
about O
food O
cravings O
. O
Your O
English O
is O
excellent O
, O

I O
will O
write O
it O

English O

People O
with O
dementia O
don O
t O
taste O
things O
as O
well O
as O
they O
used O
to O
. O
That O
s O
why O
they O
like O
food O
with O
lots O
of O
flavor O
and O
sweet O
foods O
. O
When O
the O
front O
part O
of O
the O
brain O
is O
damaged O
, O
people O
want O
to O
eat O
more O
sweet O
foods O
. O
You O
can O
help O
this O
front O
part O
of O
the O
brain O
resist O
sugar O
cravings O
by O
exercising O
, O
no O

Tips O
to O
try O
1 O
. O
Eat O
in O
a O
quiet O
and O
calm O
room O
so O
she O
doesn O
t O
get O
distracted O
. O
2 O
. O
Eat O
meals O
together O
-- O
she O
is O
more O
likely O
to O
eat O
. O
3 O
. O
Add O
in O
protein O
with O
eggs O
, O
puddings O
made O
with O
milk O
, O
or O
protein O
powder O
. O
4 O
. O
Cut O
food O
into O
small O
pieces O
so O
it O
is O
easier O
to O
chew O
. O
5 O
. O
Mash O
vegetables O
and O
make O
a O
smoothie O
or O
shake O
. O
6 O
. O
Make O
soups O
and O
stews O
-- O
everything O
in O
the O
stew O
gets O
the O
flavor O
of O
meat O
, O
but O
she O
gets O
the O
vitamins O
from O
the O
vegetables O
and O
beans O
. O
7 O
. O
Try O
adding O
lots O
of O
herbs O
so O
the O
food O
tastes O
stronger O
. O
You O
said O
she O
has O
diabetes O
and O
should O
avoid O
sweets O
. O
She O
only O
has O
a O
few O
years O
left O
to O
live O
. O
I O
think O
you O
should O
give O
her O
sweets O
if O
her O
makes O
her O
happy O
. O
If O
her O
diabetes O
gets O
worse O
, O
it O
s O
okay O
. O

I O
didn O
t O
have O
an O
increase O
in O
suicidal B-DIS
thoughts I-DIS
or O
a O
severe B-DIS
increase I-DIS
in I-DIS
anxiety I-DIS
. O
I O
couple O
years O
ago O
I O
was O
on O
400mg O
, O
and O
my O
mood O
was O
OK O
, O
but O
my O
physical O
symptoms O
of O
anxiety B-DIS
were O
high O
. O
sweating B-DIS
, O
feeling O
tired O
but O
wired O
. O
At O
150 O
, O
my O
anxiety O
isn O
t O
as O
bad O
, O
but O
my O
mood O
not O
as O
good O
. O
Its O
hard O
to O
decide O
where O
to O
draw O
the O
compromises O
. O
If O
you O
re O
really O
having O
a O
bad O
time O
, O
talk O
to O
your O
doctor O
. O
Maybe O
reducing O
your O
dose O
or O
ramping O
up O
more O
slowly O
or O
switching O
to O
something O
different O
is O
the O
best O
thing O
to O
do O
. O
If O
you O
choose O
discontinuation O
, O
tapering O
is O
important O
. O
When O
I O
first O
decided O
to O
aggreesively O
taper O
from O
400mg O
, O
I O
had O
scary O
suicidal O
thoughts O
. O
I O
also O
take O
klonopin B-DRUG
. O
Do O
you O
take O
any O
benzos B-DRUG
Klonopin B-DRUG
helps O
with O
physical O
symptoms O
, O
mood O
and O
anxiety O
, O
but O
your O
energy O
takes O
a O
hit O
. O
We O
can O
t O
win O
When O
it O
comes O
to O
medication O
, O
make O
your O
moves O
slowly O
. O
I O
recommend O
Kava B-DRUG
Kava I-DRUG
root I-DRUG
if O
you O
need O
some O
immediate O
relief O
of O
your O
anxiety O
. O
thought O
be O
careful O
, O
especially O
if O
you O
drink O
, O
as O
it O
can O
be O
hard O
on O
your O
liver O
. O
. O
Psilocin B-DRUG
is O
the O
newest O
thing O
in O
my O
arsenal O
. O
So O
far O
, O
it O
improves O
mood O
and O
cognition O
without O
exacerbating O
physically O
symptoms O
or O
anxiety O
. O
though O
it O
does O
provide O
an O
energy O
boost O
. O
Very O
small O
amount O
is O
the O
key O
. O

I O
don O
t O
see O
it O
as O
mythical O
really O
. O
I O
live O
in O
a O
medium O
sized O
city O
in O
a O
non-technical O
area O
of O
the O
US O
. O
I O
do O
have O
a O
CIS O
degree O
but O
there O
are O
people O
on O
my O
team O
with O
nothing O
more O
than O
high O
school O
education O
doing O
the O
same O
things O
as O
me O
. O
There O
are O
certifications O
you O
can O
get O
to O
get O
your O
foot O
in O
the O
door O
though O
you O
may O
need O
to O
work O
on O
a O
helpdesk O
or O
fixing O
computers O
or O
somewhere O
else O
in O
the O
company O
and O
move O
your O
way O
up O
. O
Just O
find O
a O
decent O
company O
with O
benefits O
and O
get O
on O
board O
. O
Make O
a O
good O
impression O
and O
keep O
your O
eye O
on O
the O
job O
postings O
bored O
within O
that O
company O
and O
transition O
over O
to O
something O
you O
like O
. O

That O
s O
not O
true O
, O
it O
s O
a O
misconception O
. O
There O
is O
no O
diagnostic O
criteria O
that O
states O
the O
person O
can O
t O
be O
aware O
of O
their O
situation O
. O
Yes O
some O
people O
are O
not O
at O
the O
introspective O
phase O
or O
are O
so O
outward-projecting O
that O
they O
don O
t O
realize O
it O
or O
don O
t O
want O
to O
realize O
it O
. O
They O
are O
the O
people O
who O
think O
they O
are O
innocent O
victims O
, O
probably O
stemming O
from O
abuse O
in O
childhood O
, O
and O
now O
their O
symptoms O
just O
feel O
like O
a O
reaction O
to O
an O
uncaring O
world O
. O
My O
BPD B-DIS
parent O
is O
in O
this O
category O
, O
and O
will O
never O
see O
or O
admit O
that O
they O
have O
any O
issues O
other O
than O
external O
factors O
- O
one O
crisis O
after O
another O
. O
Others O
are O
aware O
, O
or O
are O
working O
on O
awareness O
, O
and O
do O
recognize O
their O
symptoms O
and O
patterns O
of O
behavior O
. O
BPD O
patients O
make O
up O
the O
majority O
of O
inpatient O
admissions O
and O
seek O
the O
most O
psychiatric O
help O
, O
and O
how O
could O
they O
do O
that O
without O
a O
level O
of O
awareness O
So O
basically O
no O
it O
s O
not O
true O
. O

I O
wrote O
this O
in O
a O
rush O
. O
I O
felt O
great O
until O
I O
went O
hyper B-DIS
, O
at O
which O
point O
I O
began O
experiencing O
symptoms O
such O
as O
rapid B-DIS
heart I-DIS
rate I-DIS
, O
excessive B-DIS
sweating I-DIS
, O
panic B-DIS
attacks I-DIS
, O
hot B-DIS
flashes I-DIS
, O
and O
lab O
results O
to O
back O
it O
up O
. O

Because O
the O
reason O
bed O
feels O
so O
good O
is O
because O
you O
were O
out O
of O
it O
in O
the O
first O
place O
. O

May O
I O
ask O
which O
drugs O
have O
worked O
like O
magic O
for O
you O
I O
am O
looking O
for O
new O
ideas O
or O
avenues O
to O
look O
into.. O
I O
have O
had O
some O
success O
with O
modafinil B-DRUG
, O
but O
its O
more O
just O
keeping B-DIS
me I-DIS
awake I-DIS
then O
giving O
me O
any O
energy O
. O
Cheers O

You O
know O
an O
interesting O
diet O
I O
have O
heard O
of O
All O
your O
protein O
in O
amino O
acid O
form O
. O
Then O
only O
adding O
organic O
fruits O
, O
veggies O
, O
cocunut O
oil O
for O
fat O
, O
and O
a O
supplement O
like O
this O
It O
would O
be O
low O
carb O
with O
no O
meat O
. O
It O
s O
impossible O
otherwise O
since O
things O
like O
rice O
and O
beans O
have O
too O
many O
carbs O
to O
be O
considered O
no O
carb O
. O
I O
thought O
trying O
it O
for O
a O
month O
would O
be O
fun O
. O
You O
would O
spend O
150 O
a O
month O
just O
to O
get O
your O
proteins O
in O
the O
amino O
acid O
form O
though O
. O
Sounds O
crazy O
but O
it O
might O
be O
interesting O
. O
Then O
you O
could O
use O
water O
kefir O
and O
fermented O
veggies O
for O
gut O
bacteria O
instead O
of O
dairy O
and O
yogurt O
. O

The O
way O
I O
understand O
it O
, O
legions B-DIS
symptom O
. O
The O
symptom O
will O
always O
be O
there O
- O
somewhere O
- O
lurking O
under O
the O
surface O
. O
There O
will O
always O
be O
a O
chance O
it O
will O
resurface O
, O
but O
certain O
conditions O
will O
make O
that O
action O
more O
likely O
. O
I O
, O
like O
others O
here O
can O
trigger O
old O
activity O
with O
stress B-DIS
, O
lack B-DIS
of I-DIS
sleep I-DIS
, O
and O
or O
generally O
not O
taking O
care O
myself O
through O
diet O
and O
exercise O
. O

lol O
. O
me O
too O
a O
fucking O
doctor O
. O
I O
have O
UC B-DIS
40 O
years O
and O
also O
not O
a O
GI O
m.d O
. O
And O
sure O
some O
stress B-DIS
can O
complicate O
many O
most O
illnesses O
. O
Like O
cardiac B-DIS
disease I-DIS
MIs B-DIS
etc O
. O

This O
is O
something O
I O
m O
going O
to O
explore O
with O
my O
doctor O
as O
well O
. O
I O
have O
a O
friend O
with O
fibro B-DIS
who O
is O
convinced O
I O
have O
it O
. O
I O
think O
what O
s O
stopping O
me O
is O
I O
know O
that O
most O
of O
my O
pain B-DIS
comes O
from O
an O
injury B-DIS
which O
has O
resulted O
in O
bulging B-DIS
discs I-DIS
. O
To O
be O
honest O
I O
put O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
symptoms O
down O
to O
my O
back O
and O
maybe O
I O
m O
not O
giving O
them O
the O
attention O
they O
deserve O
. O
The O
fatigue B-DIS
especially O
on O
this O
level O
is O
relatively O
new O
but O
I O
m O
really O
hoping O
it O
s O
something O
as O
simple O
as O
a O
vitamin B-DIS
or I-DIS
mineral I-DIS
deficiency I-DIS
because O
that O
s O
so O
much O
easier O
to O
treat O

I O
apparently O
produce O
a O
lot O
of O
ear B-DIS
wax I-DIS
, O
and O
it O
was O
once O
so O
bad O
that O
I O
had O
to O
get O
a O
procedure O
done O
called O
an O
ear B-DIS
lavage I-DIS
where O
a O
nurse O
used O
a O
solution O
of O
some O
warm O
water O
with O
a O
bit O
of O
hydrogen B-DRUG
peroxide I-DRUG
, O
and O
used O
a O
squirty O
syringe O
to O
pressure O
wash O
out O
my O
ears O
. O
Oh O
my O
, O
the O
things O
that O
came O
out O
I O
ve O
taken O
a O
page O
from O
that O
book O
, O
and O
I O
do O
the O
same O
with O
one O
of O
those O
bulb O
syringes O
whenever O
I O
feel O
a O
bit O
gunked O
up O
. O
The O
standard O
advice O
is O
to O
chew O
gum O
jaw O
muscle O
action O
lets O
the O
spice O
flow O
, O
so O
to O
speak O
and O
to O
fill O
empty O
your O
ears O
while O
taking O
a O
hot O
shower O
, O
but O
that O
s O
not O
enough O
for O
me O
. O

Are O
you O
taking O
anything O
for O
your O
IC B-DIS
My O
IC B-DIS
is O
similar O
, O
no O
pain O
, O
but O
incredibly O
frequency O
. O
I O
take O
Oxybutynin B-DRUG
for O
my O
urgency B-DIS
and O
that O
pretty O
much O
fixes O
the O
problem O
for O
me O
. O
If O
you O
don O
t O
have O
insurance O
there O
is O
an O
over O
the O
counter O
patch O
called O
Oxytrol B-DRUG
which O
can O
help O
. O
Though O
, O
the O
actual O
pill O
medication O
works O
much O
better O
. O

I O
can O
t O
speak O
for O
the O
losing O
part O
, O
but O
for O
an O
id O
that O
isn O
t O
likely O
to O
break O
I O
use O
my O
roadid O
. O
It O
hasn O
t O
broken O
in O
the O
3 O
years O
I O
have O
had O
it O
. O

Sure O
, O
I O
ll O
share O
it O
to O
r O
Alzheimers B-DIS
. O
Thanks O
for O
stopping O
by O

Still O
seeing O
no O
difference O
but O
after O
having O
the O
problems O
for O
10 O
plus O
years O
I O
have O
come O
to O
expect O
no O
results O
. O

Appalling O
I O
was O
a O
practioner O
going O
to O
the O
ED O
saying O
I O
can O
t O
Breath O
and O
they O
were O
like O
oh O
your O
paranoid B-DIS
bc O
your O
finishing O
your O
last O
semester O
... O
um O
no O
ended O
up O
with O
3 O
bilateral B-DIS
pulmonary I-DIS
embolisms I-DIS
. O
Almost O
died O
. O
You O
have O
dyspnea B-DIS
and O
family O
history O
. O
You O
need O
those O
tests O
done O
asap O
. O
And O
if O
a O
doc O
says O
a O
CT O
angio O
is O
bett3r O
they O
are O
full O
of O
shit O
bc O
for O
micro B-DIS
clotting I-DIS
v O
q O
is O
significantly O
more O
accurate O
and O
a O
d-dimer O
is O
literally O
just O
a O
blood O
test O
How O
bad O
is O
your O
local O
ed O

I O
don O
t O
think O
we O
have O
that O
product O
here O
in O
the O
states O
. O
I O
read O
that O
ibuprofen B-DRUG
in O
general O
can O
cause O
flares O
and O
avoid O
it O
in O
general O
. O
What O
does O
ibuprofen B-DRUG
as O
a O
sodium O
mean O

Your O
scripts O
and O
Dr. O
visits O
are O
from O
CoPays O
which O
is O
different O
from O
deductible O
. O

Nothing O
Everything O

It O
raises O
the O
risk O
of O
long B-DIS
QT I-DIS
syndrome I-DIS
, O
of O
which O
one O
of O
the O
possible O
symptoms O
is O
heart B-DIS
palpitations I-DIS
. O
It O
s O
very O
rare O
though O
. O
I O
m O
actually O
on O
another O
drug O
which O
further O
increases O
the O
likelihood O
of O
long B-DIS
QT I-DIS
developing O
, O
and O
personally O
I O
judge O
it O
worth O
the O
risk O
. O
Life O
without O
these O
drugs O
is O
hell O
and O
I O
can O
t O
function O
, O
life O
on O
them O
is O
significantly O
better O
. O
So O
some O
of O
the O
stuff O
they O
did O
is O
really O
basic O
. O
They O
gave O
me O
IV B-DRUG
fluids I-DRUG
almost O
constantly O
along O
with O
IV B-DRUG
vitamins I-DRUG
and O
monitored O
what O
food O
I O
ate O
. O
Because O
I O
wasn O
t O
having O
to O
drink O
very O
much O
to O
stay O
hydrated O
there O
was O
more O
room O
for O
food O
in O
my O
stomach O
so O
I O
threw B-DIS
up I-DIS
a O
lot O
less O
. O
Also O
all O
the O
medical O
attention O
just O
made O
me O
so O
much O
less O
stressed O
. O
Ultimately O
it O
a O
gave O
me O
a O
week O
off O
from O
struggling O
with O
life O
where O
I O
could O
recover O
. O
I O
was O
also O
moved O
onto O
liquid O
medications O
which O
make O
quite O
a O
big O
difference O
for O
me O
and O
are O
almost O
impossible O
to O
get O
through O
your O
GP O
. O
In O
terms O
of O
actual O
medical O
interventions O
I O
got O
an O
appointments O
, O
tests O
, O
and O
results O
with O
neurology O
which O
I O
had O
been O
waiting O
for O
for O
ages O
. O
I O
got O
a O
NJ O
tube O
fitted O
which O
I O
hated O
and O
got O
removed O
. O
If O
the O
NJ O
tube O
had O
stayed O
in O
, O
the O
theory O
is O
that O
it O
would O
have O
given O
my O
stomach O
a O
rest O
from O
food O
and O
tested O
whether O
the O
problem O
is O
limited O
to O
my O
stomach O
or O
is O
also O
a O
problem O
with O
my O
gut O
. O
A O
big O
part O
of O
my O
problem O
is O
psychological O
which O
I O
didn O
t O
realise O
at O
the O
time O
, O
so O
I O
wish O
I O
had O
sought O
out O
a O
psychiatrist O
and O
had O
an O
assessment O
with O
them O
. O
I O
m O
sure O
the O

anaesthesiologist O
can O
make O
allowances O
for O
your O
EDS B-DIS
, O
even O
if O
there O
are O
problems O
they O
can O
adjust O
it O
as O
they O
go O
along O
. O
I O
really O
wouldn O
t O
worry O
about O
t O

Just O
in O
case O
ashwaghanda B-DRUG
is O
nightshade B-DRUG
. O

Sounds O
good O
I O
m O
vegan O
and O
agree O
that O
nutritional O
yeast O
, O
mustard O
and O
jalape O
o O
juice O
can O
help O
to O
make O
a O
yummy O
faux O
cheese O
sauce O
. O
Also O
try O
out O
a O
very O
small O
pinch O
of O
nutmeg O
and O
some O
smoked O
paprika O
next O
time O

Thanks O
so O
much O
for O
the O
insight O
. O
Unsalted O
nuts O
and O
cut O
up O
veggies O
with O
dip O
are O
awesome O
. O
Random O
question O
-- O
do O
you O
think O
it O
would O
help O
if O
we O
both O
decided O
to O
learn O
sign O
language O
, O
or O
is O
that O
a O
rather O
extreme O
measure O

thanks O
for O
the O
reply O
. O
evening O
is O
where O
I O
am O
really O
weak B-DIS
too O
. O
I O
think O
I O
should O
do O
vitamins B-DRUG
too O
now O
. O

From O
one O
caregiver O
to O
another O
. O
I O
m O
sorry O
for O
what O
you O
are O
going O
through O
. O
Mum O
also O
has O
had O
it O
for O
27 O
years O
... O

Were O
you O
put O
under O
general O
anesthesia B-DRUG
When O
I O
mentioned O
to O
the O
nurse O
I O
ve O
been O
reading O
about O
people O
having O
this O
procedure O
under O
twilight O
or O
minimal O
anesthesia B-DRUG
, O
she O
was O
shocked O
because O
of O
how O
painful O
it O
is O
supposed O
to O
be O

I O
don O
t O
think O
i O
have O
phobia B-DIS
, O
but O
i O
definitely O
afraid B-DIS
to I-DIS
crash I-DIS
. O
I O
am O
going O
to O
diving O
with O
my O
friends O
. O
I O
am O
really O
afraid O
that O
i O
may O
crash O
on O
the O
party O
. O
I O
planned O
whole O
month O
to O
go O
easy O
so O
i O
will O
be O
ok O

Ugh O
, O
cdiff B-DIS
is O
the O
worst O
I O
had O
a O
bout O
of O
it O
for O
god O
knows O
how O
long O
last O
year O
, O
probably O
3-4 O
months O
My O
old O
GI O
doctor O
finally O
tested O
me O
after O
2-3 O
months O
of O
me O
complaining O
about O
15-20 B-DIS
trips I-DIS
to I-DIS
the I-DIS
bathroom I-DIS
a I-DIS
day I-DIS
, O
and O
was O
shocked O
by O
the O
result O
, O
then O
had O
me O
go O
on O
several O
rounds O
of O
antibiotics B-DRUG
to O
try O
and O
kick O
it O
. O
Thats O
very O
interesting O
about O
the O
antibodies O
, O
i O
had O
no O
idea O

Yeah O
, O
I O
remember O
looking O
into O
accommodations O
for O
the O
AP O
test O
back O
in O
the O
day O
and O
if O
I O
remember O
correctly O
it O
has O
to O
be O
approved O
by O
the O
college O
board O
or O
something O
I O
was O
lucky O
since O
I O
went O
to O
a O
really O
small O
school O
I O
didn O
t O
have O
to O
deal O
with O
doing O
the O
test O
in O
a O
big O
room O
with O
a O

of O
people O

a O
pretty O
standard O
quality O

Very O

If O
you O
can O
, O
get O
her O
to O
a O
state O
with O
medical B-DRUG
marijuana I-DRUG
. O

You O
need O
to O
start O

low O
FODMAP O
. O
You O
should O
also O
get O
a O
probiotic O
which O
contains O

6 O

You O
should O
also O
stock O
up O
on O
loperamide B-DRUG
, O
drotaverine B-DRUG
, O
dicyclomine B-DRUG

I O
ve O
started O
taking O
thermotabs O
for O
electrolytes O
because O
while O
I O
love O
the O
original O
flavor O
of O
Gatorade O
it O
s O
just O
SO O
much O
sugar O
. O
Fruit O
infused O
water O
is O
becoming O
trendy O
but O
with O
good O
reason O
. O
Cucumbers O
, O
berries O
, O
mint O
leaves O
, O
lemon O
, O
oranges O
... O
there O
s O
lots O
of O
things O
you O
can O
dump O
in O
your O
water O
to O
give O
it O
a O
little O
flavor O
. O
But O
one O
thing O
to O
consider O
is O
tea O
Herbal O
tea O
, O
anyway O
. O
Regular O
tea O
has O
caffeine O
and O
I O
can O
t O
handle O
that O
well O
anymore O
. O
But O
if O
you O
go O
to O
a O
tea O
store O
there O
are O
so O
many O
different O
herbal O
options O
and O
a O
lot O
designed O
specifically O
for O
making O
yummy O
iced O
tea O
. O

it O
sounds O
very O
helpful O
I O
m O
glad O
to O
hear O
how O
reliable O
its O
been O
for O
you O
. O
makes O
me O
definitely O
want O
to O
try O
it O
now O
, O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
pick O
some O
up O
on O
my O
next O
local O
pharmacy O
trip O
, O
probably O
over O
this O
weekend O
. O

Sorry O
to O
hear O
you O
re O
not O
doing O
well O
. O
I O
m O
just O
going O
to O
tell O
you O
what O
worked O
for O
me O
the O
last O
3 O
years O
. O
1 O
. O
Get O
as O
much O
nutrients O
and O
calories O
in O
the O
smallest O
amount O
of O
food O
possible O
. O
My O
fav O
is O
Komplete O
shakes O
amazon O
2 O
. O
Domperidone- B-DRUG

from O
Canada O
, O
I O
get O
a O
script O
from O
my O
stomach O
doctor O
in O
the O
US O
3 O
. O
Probiotics- O
find O
the O
highest O
amount O
of O
strains O
and O
billions O
, O
people O
suggest O
fermented O
foods O
but O
to O
start O
with O
you O
might O
not O
be O
able O
to O
keep O
them O
down O
. O
4 O
. O
Stress O
will O
make O
it O
worse O
Which O
sucks O
because O
being O
sick O
makes O
you O
stressed O
, O
this O
is O
a O
hard O
one O
. O
If O
you O
can O
eat O
solids O
try O
foods O
that O
break O
down O
super O
easy O
, O
I O
swear O
all O
I O
could O
eat O
was O
pancakes O
and O
almond O
butter O
for O
a O
whole O
month O
with O
the O
nutritional O
shakes O
. O
No O
meat O
, O
no O
raw O
veg O
, O
seeds O
etc O
. O
if O
it O
takes O
a O
fair O
amount O
of O
chewing O
your O
slow O
stomach O
can O
t O
handle O
it O
. O
And O
it O
s O
not O
a O
favorable O
idea O
, O
but O
in O
my O
experience O
sometimes O
it O
was O
better O
not O
to O
eat O
than O
try O
and O
eat O
and O
be O
sick O
, O
it O
s O
a O
delicate O
balance O
and O
depends O
on O
where O
your O
weight O
is O
. O
After O
I O
stopped O
vomiting O
regularly O
I O
ate O
very O
small O
amounts O
of O
food O
at O
a O
time O
, O
like O
tablespoons O
. O
Also O
, O
standing O
up O
, O
walking O
around O
and O
stretching O
after O
I O
ate O
helped O
to O
move O
things O
along O
and O
keep O
them O
down O
. O
A O
lot O
of O
the O
pain B-DIS
comes O
from O
gas B-DIS
, O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
, O
and O
constipation B-DIS
prune O
juice O
is O
amazing O
for O
that O
too O
. O
GP B-DIS
is O
a O
pretty O
serious O
diagnosis O
, O
I O
had O
to O
change O
my O
job O
and O
get O
a O
lot O
of O
help O
from O

loved O
ones O
. O
Lean O
on O
those O
you O
can O
and O
good O
luck O
, O
I O
hope O
this O
helps O

I O
just O
had O
surgery O
on O
40mg O
of O
Pred B-DRUG
and O
it O
was O
fine O
. O
My O
surgeon O
just O
said O
to O
take O
beta B-DRUG
carotene I-DRUG
which O
should O
counteract O
the O
diminished B-DIS
healing I-DIS
from O
Pred B-DRUG
. O

psoriasin B-DRUG
ointment I-DRUG
is O
my O
go-to O
. O
it O
doesn O
t O
have O
much O
smell O
, O
and O
doesnt O
make O
a O
big O
mess O
. O
i O
also O
use O
a O
vaseline-brand O
problem O
skin O
therapy O
cream O
sometimes O
. O
it O
was O
the O
only O
thing O
that O
helped O
back O
when O
i O
didnt O
know O
i O
had O
the O
P. O
edit O
psoriasin B-DRUG
makes O
a O
gel O
too O
thats O
not O
as O
thick O
but O
i O
dont O
use O
it O
because O
it O
burns B-DIS
when O
i O
have O
cracked B-DIS
skin I-DIS
, O
and O
my O
worst O
area O
is O
the O
groin O
, O
so O
... O
ow O
. O
the O
ointment O
has O
no O
burning O
. O
also O
, O
i O
use O
sebcur-t B-DRUG
shampoo I-DRUG
sometimes O
. O
there O
s O
a O
non-coal B-DRUG
psoriasis I-DRUG
shampoo I-DRUG
that O
i O
tried O
recently O
, O
worked O
ok O
, O
but O
i O
dont O
remember O
the O
name O
of O
it O

I O
had O
to O
insist O
on O
the O
gastric O
emptying O
study O
for O
my O
daughter O
myself O
-- O
the O
Gastro O
just O
wanted O
to O
give O
her O
antibiotics B-DRUG
and O
send O
her O
away O
. O
Her O
digestion O
turned O
out O
to O
be O
3x O
slower O
than O
normal O
for O
her O
age O
, O
and O
well O
outside O
the O
range O
of O
normal O
. O
So O
I O
went O
back O
to O
our O
general O
practitioner O
and O
insisted O
on O
a O
referral O
to O
a O
neurologist O
to O
check O
for O
MS B-DIS
. O
The O
Gastro O
had O
nothing O
to O
say O
about O
her O
test O
results O
other O
than O
they O
were O
slow O
. O
His O
fix O
eurythromycin B-DRUG
, O
end O
of O
story O
. O
No O
follow O
up O
appointment O
or O
discussion O
whatsoever O
. O
If O
I O
wasn O
t O
doing O
my O
own O
investigation O
and O
insisting O
on O
tests O
and O
referrals O
myself O
, O
there O
is O
no O
way O
anyone O
would O
ever O
figure O
out O
what O
is O
wrong O
with O
her O
. O
She O
has O
other O
symptoms O
of O
MS B-DIS
that O
we O
have O
been O
wondering O
about O
and O
asking O
doctors O
about O
for O
years O
, O
with O
nothing O
coming O
of O
it O
. O
Now O
with O
this O
latest O
symptom O
, O
and O
a O
concrete O
test O
result O
, O
MS B-DIS
looks O
pretty O
likely O
. O
My O
husband O
has O
celiac B-DIS
disease I-DIS
, O
and O
kept O
going O
to O
doctors O
with O
GI B-DIS
symptoms I-DIS
for O
15 O
years O
. O
Everyone O
just O
said O
sucks O
to O
be O
you O
and O
didn O
t O
even O
mention O
celiac B-DIS
disease I-DIS
or O
SIBO B-DIS
or O
anything O
. O
If O
it O
wasn O
t O
for O
the O
Internet O
allowing O
us O
to O
finally O
figure O
it O
out O
, O
he O
still O
wouldn O
t O
have O
any O
idea O
what O
was O
wrong O
with O
him O
. O
Long O
story O
short O
you O
can O
t O
pay O
people O
to O
think O
for O
you O
, O
not O
even O
doctors O
. O

No O
worries O
When O
I O
started O
out O
I O
thought O
for O
sure O
I O
would O
have O
plenty O
of O
help O
and O
support O
both O
in O
finances O
and O
in O
nursing O
care O
to O
give O
me O
respite O
. O
Shocking O
how O
wrong O
I O
was O
. O
It O
s O
incredible O
because O
unless O
you O
re O
very O
very O
wealthy O
there O
is O
a O
good O
chance O
you O
or O
your O
loved O
one O
is O
going O
to O
fall O
between O
the O
cracks O
and O
end O
up O
suffering O
through O
the O
last O
years O
of O
life O
. O
Before O
we O
were O
able O
to O
move O
back O
home O
with O
dad O
we O
let O
the O
state O
take O
guardianship O
of O
him O
assuming O
they O
would O
keep O
him O
safe O
and O
fed O
and O
sort O
out O
his O
money O
issues O
. O
Biggest O
mistake O
ever O
. O
They O
left O
him O
at O
his O
home O
we O
asked O
for O
a O
nursing O
home O
with O
no O
phone O
, O
no O
food O
, O
and O
left O
his O
bills O
including O
the O
mortgage O
unpaid O
for O
almost O
six O
months O
. O
Our O
lender O
was O
drawing O
up O
foreclosure O
paperwork O
by O
the O
time O
I O
was O
appointed O
guardian O
. O
Massive O
nightmare O
on O
many O
levels O
. O
Something O
needs O
to O
change O
so O
that O
our O
elders O
aren O
t O
left O
to O
the O
wolves O
when O
they O
need O
help O
the O
most O
. O

Thanks O
for O
all O
the O
feedback O
ladies O
and O
gents O
Luckily O
I O
already O
have O
a O
few O
tattoos O
before O
I O
started O
imuran B-DRUG
remicade B-DRUG
so O
I O
know O
the O
ins O
and O
outs O
of O
proper O
aftercare O
. O
Also O
am O
going O
to O
run O
it O
by O
my O
doc O
as O
well O
. O
Cheers O

Sure O
, O
if O
info O
means O
pseudoscience O
garbage O
. O

But O
you O
know O
what O
, O
we O
aren O
t O
capable O
of O
doing O
the O
same O
to O
them O
. O
Even O
when O
they O
hurt O
you O
, O
you O
won O
t O
say O
anything O
, O
you O
d O
just O
keep O
it O
to O
yourself O
and O
keep O
smiling O
. O
I O
just O
wanted O
to O
love O
, O
never O
wanted O
anything O
in O
return O
. O
It O
s O
not O
enough O
for O
them O
. O
It O
hurts O
the O
most O
when O
they O
accuse O
you O
of O
something O
that O
you O
didn O
t O
do O
, O
instead O
they O
are O
the O
one O
that O
keeps O
doing O
the O
exact O
same O
thing O
to O
you O
. O

Me O
too O
. O
Sending O
a O
hug O

hope O
your O
day O
gets O
better O

Not O
really O
... O
I O
do O
notice O
it O
most O
when O
I O
lay O
flat O
on O
my O
back O
but O
really O
don O
t O
have O
a O
clue O
. O
It O
s O
the O
dumbest O
thing O
. O
Who O
has O
toe B-DIS
pain I-DIS
Scraping O
the O
bottom O
of O
the O
barrel O
here O
. O

Pretty O
much O
what O
I O
m O
getting O
from O
it O
. O
If O
I O
m O
like O
this O
for O
5 O
more O
days O
I O
m O
calling O
it O
. O

Hi O
, O
are O
you O
male O
Also O
is O
you O
frequent B-DIS
urination I-DIS
on O
off O

Funny O
story O
, O
that O
s O
the O
place O
that O
helped O
me O
get O
diagnosed O
. O
I O
ate O
a O
huge O
piece O
of O
chocolate O
cake O
there O
and O
felt O
like O
shit O
for O
days O
. O
Along O
with O
the O
peeing B-DIS
, O
puking B-DIS
and O
weight B-DIS
loss I-DIS
, O
we O
knew O
something O
was O
wrong O
. O

Bullshit O
helps O
people O
who O
are O
desperate O
enough O
to O
swallow O
it O
. O
So O
I O
give O
them O
out O
of O
simple O
human O
empathy O
. O
I O
can O
not O
really O
force O
myself O
into O
buying O
some O
resoaning O
I O
know O
to O
be O
flawed O
. O

Residual B-DIS
pain I-DIS
is O
not O
normal O
. O
If O
you O
re O
having O
pain B-DIS
you O
have O
a O
stone B-DIS
. O
Something O
that O
looks O
like O
1 O
stone B-DIS
on O
a O
scan O
can O
be O
2 O
stones B-DIS
side O
by O
side O
. O
How O
long O
it O
takes O
to O
pass O
the O
stone O
is O
variable O
. O
It O
can O
take O
days O
or O
weeks O
. O
And O
pain B-DIS
can O
be O
all O
over O
the O
map O
. O
Sometimes O
it O
presents O
as O
the O
classic B-DIS
flank I-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
sometimes O
it O
feels O
like O
period B-DIS
pain I-DIS
, O
sometimes O
it O
feels O
like O
intestinal B-DIS
pain I-DIS
which O
is O
really O
worrisome O
when O
it O
s O
in O
the O
lower O
right O
. O
I O
find O
that O
once O
it O
gets O
to O
the O
bladder O
it O
s O
a O
lot O
better O
albeit O
annoying O
, O
like O
having O
a O
mild O
UTI B-DIS
. O
But O
then O
the O
worst O
is O
over O
. O
But O
it O
can O
hang O
around O
in O
the O
bladder O
for O
days O
. O
Pain B-DIS
can O
come O
and O
go O
. O
You O
can O
have O
pain B-DIS
free O
periods O
and O
then O
the O
pain B-DIS
can O
come O
back O
. O
That O
s O
why O
it O
s O
called O
renal B-DIS
colic I-DIS
severe O
, O
often O
fluctuating B-DIS
pain I-DIS
. O
It O
s O
quite O
possible O
to O
have O
stones B-DIS
on O
both O
sides O
. O
When O
you O
get O
dehydrated B-DIS
your O
urine O
becomes O
more O
concentrated O
and O
crystals B-DIS
form O
. O
So O
it O
s O
quite O
possible O
it O
happens O
in O
both O
kidneys O
. O
Standard O
treatment O
is O
drink O
plenty O
of O
water O
, O
like O
an O
8 O
ounce O
glass O
every O
2 O
hours O
. O
Take O
Flomax B-DRUG
to O
relax O
the O
muscles O
in O
the O
urinary O
tract O
. O
Activity O
can O
aid O
peristalsis B-DIS
which O
moves O
the O
stone O
along O
. O
Non O
standard O
things O
are O
beer O
but O
not O
with O
pain B-DRUG
killers I-DRUG
and O
sex O

Pump O

50 O

starting O
at O
least O
30 O
minutes O
before O
the O
race O
and O
for O
as O
long O
as O
the O
race O
lasts O
I O
usually O
just O
put O
in O
an O
absurdly O
long O
duration O
that O
I O
know O
lasts O
longer O
than O
it O
ll O
take O
me O
to O
run O
, O
then O
kill O
it O
when O
I O
finish O
. O
Get O
a O
pump O
clip O
if O
possible O
. O
I O
also O
use O
an O
armband O
to O
carry O
my O
CGM O
and O

, O
plus O
at O

one O

Awesome O
blog O
post O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
IC B-DIS
since O
2008 O
and O
I O
just O
started O
the O
keto O
diet O
. O
I O
m O
on O
day O
11 O
. O
Today O
I O
felt B-DIS
very I-DIS
nauseous I-DIS
but O
it O
has O
thankfully O
passed O
. O
I O
m O
curious O
as O
to O
what O
you O
put O
in O
your O
smoothies O
and O
how O
you O
made O
your O
vanilla O
fat O
bomb O
. O
I O
m O
definitely O
interested O
in O
seeing O
how O
you O
do O
on O
the O
keto O
diet O
. O

Ask O
him O
if O
he O
is O
interested O
. O
Then O
see O
what O
how O
he O
responds O
and O
let O
us O
know O
. O
It O
is O
very O
important O
to O
have O
his O
consent O
. O
For O
me O
I O
have O
zero O
interest O
in O
smoking O
, O
or O
vaping O
, O
as O
I O
ve O
had O
part O
of O
my O
lung O
removed O
due O
to O
cancer B-DIS
. O
Never O
smoked O
, O
so O
thought O
I O
d O
be O
the O
last O
person O
to O
get O
lung B-DIS
cancer I-DIS
. O
I O
have O
a O
very O
difficult B-DIS
time I-DIS
sleeping I-DIS
, O
and O
was O
able O
to O
get O
edible O
for O
sleeping O
aid O
. O
Medical B-DRUG
Marijuana I-DRUG
MM B-DRUG
and O
all O
I O
said O
was O
for O
Parkinsons B-DIS
to O
help O
me O
sleep O
No O
idea O
what O
the O
THC B-DRUG
CBD B-DRUG
was O
, O
but O
first O
time O
I O
slept O
for O
eight O
hours O
in O
over O
20 O
years O
. O
Sleep O
is O
wonderful O
, O
but O
sadly O
MM O
is O
not O
legal O
where O
I O
live O
. O
Hopefully O
he O
is O
still O
active O
with O
exercise O
and O
stretching O
movement O
. O
Let O
us O
know O
how O
he O
is O
doing O
. O

I O
m O
really O
sorry O
to O
hear O
about O
your O
illness O
; O
I O
can O
t O
imagine O
how O
scary O
it O
must O
be O
from O
your O
perspective O
. O
My O
father O
was O
misdiagnosed O
for O
years O
and O
constantly O
in O
denial O
about O
it O
, O
so O
I O
never O
got O
a O
chance O
to O
really O
talk O
to O
him O
about O
how O
he O
felt O
. O
1- O
I O
would O
not O
say O
I O
wished O
his O
disease O
did O
not O
drag O
along O
100 O
. O
For O
5-6 O
years O
after O
he O
was O
diagnosed O
he O
was O
still O
relatively O
happy O
and O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
good O
days O
. O
It O
was O
still O
hard O
, O
but O
I O
wouldn O
t O
want O
to O
throw O
those O
years O
away O
. O
The O
last O
4-5 O
years O
of O
his O
life O
he O
was O
in O
an O
assisted O
living O
home O
since O
we O
could O
no O
longer O
keep O
up O
with O
him O
. O
He O
was O
starting B-DIS
to I-DIS
lose I-DIS
his I-DIS
balance I-DIS
and O
fell O
down O
the O
stairs O
a O
few O
times O
. O
After O
that O
, O
there O
wasn O
t O
much O
happiness O
for O
him O
or O
for O
us O
when O
we O
visited O
him O
. O
He O
couldn O
t O
understand O
why O
he O
lived O
there O
and O
couldn O
t O
go O
home O
which O
was O
heartbreaking O
. O
Then O
he O
forgot O
us O
except O
for O
my O
mom O
, O
got B-DIS
combative I-DIS
, O
was O
eventually O
bedridden B-DIS
and O
would O
rarely O
open O
his O
eyes O
when O
we O
went O
to O
visit O
him O
. O
I O
d O
be O
lying O
if O
I O
said O
there O
was O
anything O
good O
about O
the O
last O
three O
years O
or O
so O
, O
it O
hurt O
to O
see O
him O
and O
I O
knew O
he O
was O
just O
fluctuating O
between O
being O
oblivious O
and O
miserable O
. O
2- O
Letters O
would O
have O
been O
nice O
. O
I O
have O
heard O
stories O
about O
him O
and O
remember O
bits O
and O
pieces O
of O
how O
he O
was O
when O
I O
was O
little O
, O
but O
it O
would O
be O
nice O
to O
have O
had O
a O
conversation O
with O
him O
about O
what O
he O
thought O
about O
me O
. O
I O
d O
say O
write O
about O
what O
your O
boys O
are O
doing O
, O

how O
you O
see O
them O
and O
feel O
about O
them O
, O
and O
any O
advice O
you O
want O
them O
to O
remember O
. O
Stories O
about O
you O
would O
be O
nice O
too O
, O
but O
they O
will O
hear O
about O
you O
from O
others O
that O
have O
known O
you O
. O
Nobody O
but O
you O
can O
tell O
them O
how O
you O
feel O
about O
them O
and O
what O
they O
do O
that O
makes O
you O
proud O
. O
My O
father O
filmed O
a O
lot O
of O
home O
videos O
when O
we O
were O
kids O
, O
but O
was O
always O
the O
one O
behind O
the O
camera O
. O
It O
may O
seem O
small O
, O
but O
ask O
your O
wife O
or O
someone O
else O
to O
film O
during O
a O
holiday O
dinner O
or O
family O
get O
together O
so O
they O
can O
see O
you O
and O
how O
you O
acted O
, O
your O
mannerism O
, O
your O
sense O
of O
humor O
, O
etc O
. O
Whenever O
I O
m O
watching O
an O
old O
video O
and O
I O
see O
my O
dad O
it O
s O
always O
a O
treat O
, O
even O
a O
few O
seconds O
of O
him O
smiling O
or O
gardening O
or O
anything O
. O
Lastly O
, O
don O
t O
feel O
selfish O
making O
this O
about O
you O
. O
I O
m O
already O
afraid O
this O
will O
happen O
to O
me O
and O
am O
constantly O
thinking O
of O
things O
I O
can O
do O
to O
prepare O
my O
kids O
for O
it O
. O
Your O
boys O
will O
appreciate O
the O
efforts O
you O
make O
now O
more O
than O
you O
will O
ever O
know O
. O
I O
wish O
you O
and O
your O
family O
nothing O
but O
good O
memories O
to O
look O
back O
on O
. O

Yeah O
. O
Same O
can O
be O
said O
for O
me O
. O
Also O
please O
update O
me O
what O
your O
doctor O
tell O
you O
. O
Hopefully O
it O
s O
not O
too O
scary O
. O
Good O
luck O
. O

will O
check O
when O
i O
get O
home O
, O
but O
generally O
cure O
is O
a O
red O
flag O
. O
Real O
doctors O
treat O
a O
disorder O
or O
condition O
. O

This O
is O
hilarious O
. O
I O
ve O
also O
been O
that O
patient O
. O
After O
all O
the O
instilations O
, O
surgeries O
and O
everything O
else O
, O
I O
don O
t O
have O
any O
shame O
left O
about O
my O
body O
, O
and O
I O
probably O
would O
have O
laughed O
about O
it O
too O
. O
I O
can O
t O
believe O
they O
did O
the O
installation O
with O
a O
flashlight O

I O
have O
already O
loosened O
the O
reins O
and O
one O
of O
my O
newbie O
12 O
yos O
is O
already O
giving O
himself O
his O
shot O
. O
The O
other O
one O
is O
more O
squeamish O
about O
needles O
. O
But O
he O
too O
, O
will O
soon O
be O
doing O
it O
. O
My O
16 O
yo O
is O
very O
independent O
currently O
on O
a O
pump O
-- O
- O
he O
doesn O
t O
get O
in O
trouble O
for O
highs O
or O
lows O
. O
The O
only O
time O
I O
ever O
get O
onto O
him O
is O
when O
he O
forgets O
to O
bolus O
. O
And O
it O
s O
more O
like O
a O
look O
and O
a O
come O
on O
, O
kiddo O
, O
you O
re O
smarter O
than O
that O
. O
Sort O
of O
thing O
. O
But O
never O
yelling O
or O
chastising O
him O
. O
He O
is O
usually O
very O
good O
about O
his O
schedule O
but O
sometimes O
Xbox O
or O
his O
phone O
are O
more O
important O
to O
him O
. O
I O
just O
try O
to O
gently O
remind O
him O
that O
his O
health O
should O
be O
first O
priority O
. O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
response O
, O
I O
ll O
try O
to O
hang O
in O
there O

Can O
attest O
to O
this O
. O

Very O
similar O
to O
what O
you O
said O
... O
The O
freedom O
of O
just O
doing O
things O
. O
Traveling O
, O
drinking O
, O
feeling O
competent O
efficient O
at O
work O
. O
Also O
, O
bedroom O
activities O

Crack O
away O
. O
This O
is O
not O
a O
bad O
thing O
at O
all O
. O
I O
don O
t O
blame O
you O
for O
not O
wanting O
to O
go O
on O
any O
RA B-DIS
drugs O
. O
I O
have O
had O
RA B-DIS
for O
10 O
years O
. O
When O
I O
was O
first O
diagnosed O
the O
second O
I O
was O
diagnosed O
the O
docs O
were O
pushing O
the O
meds O
. O
I O
took O
my O
time O
and O
looked O
at O
all O
my O
options O
. O
Naturopathic O
, O
diet O
, O
movement O
, O
RA B-DIS
flare O
triggers O
, O
etc O
. O
I O
went O
on O
metheltrexate B-DRUG
for O
about O
6 O
months O
. O
It O
was O
horrible O
. O
I O
was O
sick O
all O
the O
time O
and O
felt O
like O
total O
crap O
. O
I O
decided O
to O
find O
out O
what O
foods O
and O
chemicals O
etc O
. O
Made O
my O
body O
trigger O
and O
inflame O
. O
I O
also O
get O
exercise O
every O
day O
. O
I O
am O
in O
a O
much O
better O
place O
physically O
and O
mentally O
without O
drugs O
. O
I O
do O
get O
flares B-DIS
and O
have O
pain B-DIS
. O
I O
try O
to O
work O
through O
them O
. O
This O
is O
your O
journey O
and O
you O
get O
to O
decide O
what O
does O
and O
doesn O
t O
work O
for O
you O

My O
MVP B-DIS
was O
caught O
w O
a O
Holter O
Monitor O
in O
early O
1990 O
s O
and O
other O
heart O
stupidities O
were O
caught O
years O
later O
, O
there O
again O
, O
w O
Holter O
Monitor O
. O
I O
ve O
worn O
the O
Holter O
Monitor O
many O
different O
times O
in O
life O
, O
sometimes O
1 O
week O
and O
sometimes O
1 O
month O
. O
That O
s O
how O
my O
heart B-DIS
conditions I-DIS
were O
diagnosed O
. O
I O
ve O
also O
had O
a O
few O
heart O
stress O
tests O
done O
as O
well O
as O
many O
other O
different O
type O
of O
heart O
testings O
. O
I O
wouldn O
t O
worry O
too O
much O
into O
the O
Congestive B-DIS
Heart I-DIS
Failure I-DIS
if O
your O
doc O
doesn O
t O
think O
anything O
of O
it O
. O
The O
main O
thing O
is O
being O
tested O
and O
following O
doc O
s O
orders O
* O
same O
as O
w O
anyone O
getting O
their O
MAGNESIUM O
tested O
too O
be O
tested O
follow O
doc O
s O
orders O
* O
. O
If O
you O
think O
you O
have O
MVP B-DIS
it O
s O
good O
to O
get O
tested O
. O
If O
you O
do O
have O
MVP B-DIS
then O
the O
doc O
will O
likely O
put O
you O
on O
a O
Beta B-DRUG
Blocker I-DRUG
. O
You O
will O
need O
to O
follow O
doc O
s O
orders O
. O
I O
ve O
read O
that O
if O
one O
lets O
MVP B-DIS
go O
untreated O
then O
your O
heart O
could O
enlarge O
thereby O
causing O
other O
problems O
. O
I O
had O
normal O
to O
high O
BP O
s O
for O
years O
w O
it O
rising O
higher O
and O
higher O
and O
then O
the O
adrenaline B-DIS
surges I-DIS
started O
. O
At O
that O
point O
, O
my O
magnesium B-DIS
was I-DIS
found I-DIS
to I-DIS
be I-DIS
low I-DIS
and O
I O
started O
taking O
Magnesium B-DRUG
tablets I-DRUG
.now O
it O
s O
the O
opposite O
. O
I O
think O
I O
m O
understanding O
it O
correctly O
, O
that O
the O
low O
BP O
s O
were O
triggered O
by O
Dysautonomia B-DIS
by O
way O
of O
the O
lax O
jointed O
Ehlers-Dalos B-DIS

that O
I O
can O

to O

I O

doses O
of O
magnesium O

o O
the O
direction O
of O
a O
doc O

I O
went O
vegan O
in O

and O
it O
was O
the O
final O
piece O
of O
the O
puzzle O
that O
has O
effectively O
eliminated O
my O
symptoms O
. O
Increased O
fibre O
doesn O
t O
seem O
to O
be O
an O
issue O
at O
all O

I O
think O
cutting O
out O
dairy O
and O
all O
the O
fat O
and O
sugar O
that O
comes O
with O
it O
was O
key O
. O

Don O
t O
forget O
the O
apple B-DRUG
cider I-DRUG
vinegar I-DRUG
. O
It O
releases O
minerals O
from O

, O
it O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
nutrients O
. O
It O
helped O
with O
heartburn B-DIS
problems O
I O
had O
in O
the O
past O
also O
. O
But O
my O
acid B-DIS
reflux I-DIS
has O
mostly O
gone O
away O
since O
I O
made O
the O
organic O
switch O
and O
started O
caring O
about O
my O
gut O
flora O

So O
like O
it O
s O
hard O
for O
me O
to O
tell O
but O
I O
had O
difficulty B-DIS
urinating I-DIS
for O
like O
4 O
days O
but O
pain B-DIS
for O
one O
. O
That O
one O
day O
was O
when O
I O
went O
to O
the O
ER O
. O
So O
5 O
days O
total O

Similar O
experience O
with O
Eustachian O
tube O
- O
I O
have O
no O
idea O

Oh O
interesting O
, O
I O
ll O
have O
to O
check O
the O
app O
out O
, O
thanks O
And O
I O
would O
ve O
thought O
that O
dairy O
free O
would O
also O
mean O
no O
casein O
But O
if O
they O
do O
still O
have O
casein O
that O
very O
well O
could O
be O
he O
issue O
. O
I O
struggled O
with O
casein O
protein O
even O
before O
these O
issues O
started O

big O
, O
known O
issue O
. O
be O
sure O
to O
discuss O
with O
your O
mom O
, O
if O
they O
are O
still O
together O
. O
hypersexuality B-DIS
, O
gambling B-DIS
, O
all O
kinds O
of O
stuff O
can O
happen O
. O
dopamine B-DRUG
does O
a O
lot O
other O
than O
movement O
regulation O
. O

It O
s O
illegal O
in O
my O
state O
so O
it O
s O
a O
no O
from O
me O
. O
However O
, O
you O
can O
buy O
little O
cigarette O
rolling O
tools O
so O
you O
don O
t O
do O
it O
by O
hand O
. O
Super O
nifty O
. O

Yep O
... O
that O
rocking O
side O
to O
side O
motion O
is O
actually O
good O
for O
moving O
stuff O
through O
the O
bowels O
. O
My O
main O
habits O
are O
putting O
my O
head O
in O
my O
hands O
and O
running O
my O
fingers O
through O
it O
... O
banging O
my O
head O
against O
the O
wall O
, O
usually O
sideways O
with O
my O
normal O
side-to-side O
motion O
. O
Oh O
, O
and O
cursing O
like O
a O
sailor O
... O
a O
lot O
. O

This O
. O
I O
was O
seeing O
a O
doctor O
at O
a O
college O
health O
center O
and O
nobody O
would O
give O
two O
shits O
about O
it O
. O
Went O
to O
a O
dermatologist O
once O
and O
they O
told O
me O
this O
happens O
alot O
with O
general O
practitioners O
and O
got O
the O
injection O
leading O
to O
a O
year O
or O
more O
completely O
free O
. O

gt O
; O
But O
seriously O
what O
s O
can O
I O
get O
these O
pills O
I O
get O
mine O
at O
my O
local O
health O
food O
store O
. O
I O
buy O
the O
NOW O
brand O
, O
but O
IIRC O
Heather O
s O
sells O
peppermint O
gel O
caps O
too O
. O
Called O
Tummy O
Tamers O
IIRC O
. O
FYI O
, O
if O
you O
have O
any O
issues O
with O
reflux B-DIS
or O
GERD B-DIS
or O
the O
like O
, O
peppermint O
oil O
may O
make O
that O
worse O
. O

It O
s O
always O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
see O
a O
urologist O
and O
get O
a O
CT O
scan O
. O
If O
a O
stone B-DIS
is O
blocking O
one O
of O
your O
kidneys O
, O
it O
can O
lead O
to O
hydronephrosis B-DIS
, O
which O
is O
bad O
for O
your O
kidney O
. O
He O
ll O
also O
put O
you O
on O
antibiotics B-DRUG
. O
You O
definitely O
don O
t O
want O
to O
leave O
a O
urinary B-DIS
tract I-DIS
infection I-DIS
untreated O
. O
Read O
this O

check O
the O
Parkinsons B-DIS
Disease I-DIS
Foundation O
website O
for O
resources O
or O
the O
Michael O
J O
Fox O
Foundation O
site O
Specifically O
this O
could O
be O
useful O
for O
you O
and O
your O
family O
as O
a O
starting O
point O
For O
reference O
I O
have O
had O
this O
shit O
disease O
for O
almost O
8 O
years O
now O
since O
I O
was O
35yo O
, O
so O
much O
of O
my O
advice O
is O
not O
going O
to O
be O
relevant O
to O
your O
Dad O
at O
77 O
, O
but O
these O
sites O
are O
good O
resources O
, O
unlike O
so O
much O
other O
junk O
science O
on O
the O
net O
- O
Best O
of O
luck O
and O
I O
hope O
your O
Dad O
doesn O
t O
join O
this O
club O
... O

gt O
; O
my O
IBS B-DIS
was O
under O
control O
after O
trying O
low-fodmap O
diet O
and O
verrrry O
slowly O
introducing O
foods O
back O
that O
don O
t O
cause O
flare O
ups O
Are O
you O
currently O
eating O
normally O
again O

After O
mine O
it O
was O
just O
mild B-DIS
bladder I-DIS
and I-DIS
urethra I-DIS
discomfort I-DIS
for O
a O
couple O
days O
. O
Not O
even O
close O
to O
regular O
IC B-DIS
shit O
. O

Thank O
you O
Yeah O
I O
got O
ta O
figure O
out O
what O
to O
read O
as O
well O
... O
So O
many O
book O
choices O
at O
my O
disposal O
haha O

Most O
sleep O
apps O
are O
pants O
to O
be O
fair O
. O
I O
ve O
had O
a O
few O
tell O
me O
i O
was O
sleeping O
great O
but O
i O
wasnt O
. O
Sleep O
as O
android O
was O
the O
best O
one O
i O
found O
. O
It O
also O
records O
noise O
when O
you O
move O
so O
i O
heard O
my O
horrible O
choking O
sounds O
all O
night O
. O
That O
motivated O
me O
to O
get O
my O
apnea O
sorted O
. O

Oh O
my O
apologies O
, O
I O
ve O
never O
really O
looked O
into O
FODMAPS O
so O
i O
m O
talking O
out O
my O
arse O
... O
The O
quantities O
of O
these O
are O
often O
very O
small O
in O
comparison O
to O
everything O
else O
as O
have O
to O
watch O
the O
carbs O
, O
also O
. O
Thanks O

I O
used O
at-gel B-DRUG
just O
about O
an O
hour O
ago O
, O
and O
it O
s O
been O
reduced O
a O
lot O
. O
It O
it O
helps O
, O
before O
, O
I O
used O
an O
anti-dandruff B-DRUG
shampoo I-DRUG
, O
which O
I O
found O
out O
it O
was O
harmful O
to O
psoriasis B-DIS
. O
Maybe O
I O
will O
try O
Clobex B-DRUG
, O
but O
for O
now O
I O
ll O
try O
T-gel B-DRUG
for O
2 O
3 O
times O
a O
week O
. O
But O
the O
other O
days O
, O
ordinary B-DRUG
shampoo I-DRUG
will O
be O
okay O

I O
didn O
t O
gain O
weight O
so O
far O
, O
but O
I O
did O
go O
through O
some O
intense O
chocolate O
cravings O
. O
I O
think O
it O
might O
mess O
with O
your O
appetite O
so O
I O
d O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
it O
but O
as O
long O
as O
you O
re O
watching O
what O
you O
eat O
you O
shouldn O
t O
have O
an O
issue O
. O

It O
s O
prescription O
in O
Canada O
, O
I O
take O
the O
18 O
mg O
as O
needed O
. O
I O
seem O
to O
remember O
that O
it O
was O
available O
over O
the O
counter O
in O
Washington O
State O
at O
Compounding O
Pharmacies O
. O

Are O
your O
levels O
optimal O
or O
just O
in O
range O
Not O
all O
doctors O
will O
listen O
to O
you O
. O
Consider O
switching O
brands O
of O
medication O
. O
That O
made O
a O
difference O
for O
me O
. O
Also O
, O
check O
to O
make O
sure O
you O
aren O
t O
deficient B-DIS
in I-DIS
any I-DIS
vitamins I-DIS
or I-DIS
minerals I-DIS
. O
Low B-DIS
D I-DIS
is O
common O
and O
can O
share O
similar O
symptoms O
as O
hypo B-DIS
. O

You O
definitely O
matter O
. O
I O
m O
sorry O
you O
ve O
been O
through O
hardships O
that O
have O
left O
you O
feeling O
so O
heartbroken O
, O
I O
can O
hear O
it O
in O
your O
words O
. O
Did O
something O
happen O
that O
hurt O
you O
recently O
or O
has O
been O
weighing O
on O
your O
mind O
, O
if O
you O
don O
t O
mind O
me O
asking O

I O
guess O
that O
s O
the O
magic O
age O
Biologics O
effect O
my O
immune O
system O
too O
much O
. O
They O
are O
what O
cause O
me O
to O
catch O
shingles B-DIS
at O
age O
25 O
. O
It O
s O
a O
vicious O
cycle O
, O
I O
ve O
opted O
to O
avoid O
biologics B-DRUG
for O
now O
. O

Only O
open O
to O
Americans O

Be O
kind O
to O
yourself O
. O
I O
know O
even O
trivial O
things O
feel O
absolutely O
exhausting O
and O
impossible O
. O
But O
take O
your O
time O
, O
take O
deep O
breaths O
, O
meditate O
, O
and O
set O
small O
achievable O
goals O
. O
Like O
writing O
this O
post O

I O
write O
two O
blogs O
T2 O
and O
travel O
Do O
it O
regardless O
of O
the O
interest O
of O
others O
. O
I O
write O
my O
travel O
blog O
for O
my O
80yo O
self O
, O
to O
remind O
me O
when O
the O
memories B-DIS
fade I-DIS
, O
but O
I O
m O
pleasantly O
surprised O
when O
others O
read O
it O
. O
I O
wrote O
the O
T2 O
blog O
as O
an O
archive O
because O
I O
found O
I O
was O
too O
often O
repeating B-DIS
myself I-DIS
on O
forums O
. O
Write O
to O
enjoy O
it O
; O
let O
others O
decide O
for O
themselves O
if O
they O
choose O
to O
read O
it O

PS O
Vietnam O
is O
on O
my O
catch-up O
list O

I O
ve O
been O
to O
China O
, O
Laos O
, O
Cambodia O
, O

not O
Vietnam O
. O
I O
look O
forward O
to O
reading O
your O

. O

Thanks O
I O
can O
t O
believe O
you O
remember O
Crushed O
perfectly O
describes O
it O
. O
Now O
, O
I O
m O
cautiously O
optimistic O
. O
I O
know O
I O
m O
long O
winded O
and O
overly O
active O
on O
this O
sub O
, O
but O
I O
am O
so O
grateful O
to O
everyone O
here O
. O
I O
really O
don O
t O
think O
I O
would O
be O
doing O
so O
well O
today O
without O
this O
wonderful O
group O
of O
people O
on O
this O
subreddit O
. O
Sure O
, O
your O
suggestions O
have O
made O
a O
huge O
difference O
in O
my O
physical O
comfort O
I O
mean O
why O
don O
t O
doctors O
tell O
you O
about O
the O
baking O
soda O
trick O
for O
really B-DIS
bad I-DIS
flares I-DIS
, O
but O
the O
emotional O
support O
from O
people O
who O
really O
understand O
has O
been O
amazing O
. O
I O
talked O
with O
my O
best O
friend O
later O
last O
night O
and O
she O
said O
she O
almost O
cried O
seeing O
me O
standing O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
road O
cheering O
her O
on O
in O
my O
cycling O
team O
kit O
, O
so O
she O
gets O
it O
too O
, O
but O
you O
can O
only O
subject O
your O
poor O
friends O
with O
your O
misbehaving B-DIS
bladder I-DIS
stories O
so O
many O
times O
, O
haha O
. O
Anyway O
, O
thanks O

How O
did O
you O
find O
out O
about O
POTS B-DIS
if O
you O
don O
t O
mind O
me O
asking O
I O
m O
always O
amazed O
that O
people O
know O
about O
it O
to O
even O
come O
and O
ask O
us O
what O
we O
think O
here O
on O
this O
forum O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
find O
out O
about O
POTS B-DIS
until O
I O
d O
done O
two O
years O
of O
online O
research O
to O
figure O
out O
why O
my O
health O
was O
deteriorating O
. O
Anyway O
, O
if O
you O
think O
this O
is O
totally O
caused O
by O
deconditioning O
and O
you O
re O
not O
having O
any O
other O
symptoms O
beyond O
the O
increase B-DIS
in I-DIS
heart I-DIS
rate I-DIS
, O
then O
I O
think O
you O
should O
get O
to O
the O
gym O
. O
If O
working O
out O
on O
something O
like O
a O
treadmill O
is O
hard O
because O
of O
the O
standing O
, O
then O
start O
on O
a O
recumbent O
bike O
or O
a O
rowing O
machine O
and O
do O
the O
leg O
strengthening O
machines O
. O
If O
your O
leg O
muscles O
are O
stronger O
, O
it O
s O
going O
to O
help O
your O
blood O
vessels O
constrict O
and O
push O
the O
blood O
back O
up O
to O
your O
heart O
when O
you O
stand O
. O
I O
don O
t O
really O
know O
how O
long O
it O
would O
take O
to O
resolve O
itself O
... O
I O
can O
t O
imagine O
it O
d O
be O
too O
long O
. O

Yeah O
, O
you O
re O
smaller O
than O
me O
, O
I O
m O
5 O
9 O
and O
105lb O
and O
I O
was O
getting O
major B-DIS
side I-DIS
effects I-DIS
. O
The O
half O
dose O
works O
pretty O
well O
for O
me O
though O
. O

Where O
can O
I O
get O
activated B-DRUG
charcoal I-DRUG
Is O
it O
expensive O

Good O
to O
know O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
realize O
how O
unlikely O
it O
was O
to O
have O
both O
RA O
and O
Lupus O
. O
Hoping O
the O
same O
will O
be O
true O
for O
her O
as O
with O
you O
. O
Will O
also O
check O
into O
the O
PA O
route O
. O
I O
think O
we O
d O
be O
happy O
with O
anyone O
more O
knowledgeable O
than O
the O
gp O
at O
this O
point O
. O
He O
s O
not O
a O
bad O
doctor O
just O
out O
of O
his O
breadth O
here O
. O
I O
had O
a O
friend O
that O
had O
good O
luck O
with O
black O
cherry O
juice O
, O
I O
had O
forgotten O
about O
that O
. O
I O
ll O
pick O
some O
up O
for O
sure O

I O
had O
a O
friend O
buy O
me O
a O
Liftware O
kit O
for O
Christmas O
. O
Like O
u O
parkiedude O
said O
it O
is O
around O
about O
200 O
but O
some O
insurance O
companies O
will O
help O
pay O
the O
cost O
. O
It O
s O
a O
great O
price O
of O
equipment O
and O
I O
use O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O
They O
have O
a O
printable O
pdf O
form O
on O
the O
website O
to O
decide O
how O
useful O
it O
would O
be O
for O
you O
whoever O
it O
s O
for O
. O
Highly O
recommended O
. O
My O
only O
qualm O
is O
the O
charging O
apparatus O
. O
Getting O
it O
on O
the O
charger O
and O
having O
it O
charge O
can O
be O
difficult O
sometimes O
since O
the O
charging O
bit O
has O
the O
be O
in O
a O
specific O
place O
. O

Definitely O
night O
times O
and O
subject O
to O
change O
. O

Thank O
you O
And O
I O
agree O
. O
I O
think O
switching O
from O
the O
Enlite B-DRUG
CGM I-DRUG
to O
the O
Dexcom B-DRUG
I O
talked O
breifly O
about O
it O
with O
my O
doc O
yesterday O
will O
give O
me O
that O
piece O
of O
mind O
I O
need O
to O
be O
able O
to O
take O
full O
doses O
of O
insulin B-DRUG
without O
fear O
of O
bottoming O
out O
. O
That O
s O
honestly O
the O
biggest O
obstacle O
I O
need O
to O
overcome O
. O
I O
had O
a O
very O
scary O
set O
of O
lows O
about O
a O
year O
ago O
and O
havent O
fully O
recovered O
from O
that O
on O
the O
anxiety B-DIS
front O
. O
I O
m O
frustrated O
but O
I O
know O
that O
I O
m O
the O
only O
person O
who O
can O
make O
these O
changes O
for O
myself O
. O

Not O
a O
doctor O
or O
therapist O
. O
The O
only O
thing O
the O
MRI O
of O
my O
brain O
told O
me O
is O
that O
I O
don O
t O
have O
MS B-DIS
, O
just O
one O
brain B-DIS
lesion I-DIS
. O
Parkinsons B-DIS
was O
diagnosed O
by O
a O
neurologist O
, O
then O
confirmed O
by O
a O
movement O
specialist O
. O
While O
I O
do O
have O
2 O
other O
debilitating O
diagnosis O
, O
I O
was O
quickly O
ruled O
disabled O
by O
Social O
Security O
. O
Find O
a O
attorney O
that O
handles O
100s O
of O
disability O
cases O
, O
that O
only O
gets O
a O
small O
percentage O
of O
the O
original O
pay O
out O
, O
and O
get O
this O
started O
asap O
. O
Just O
my O
personal O
experience O
. O
Wish O
the O

My O
go O
to O
ones O
would O
have O
to O
be O
Max O
which O
is O
about O
a O
military O
service O
man O
s O
dog O
that O
is O
given O
to O
his O
son O
after O
he O
dies O
. O
Also O
, O
hacksaw O
ridge O
is O
a O
another O
one O
. O
There O
might O
be O
more O
but O
I O
can O
t O
think O
of O
anything O
else O
. O

Wow O
that O
s O
a O
good O
result O
Good O
to O
hear O
, O
although O
I O
m O
yet O
to O
be O
diagnosed O
maybe O
will O
be O
tomorrow O
, O
had O
a O
big O
attack B-DIS
of I-DIS
the I-DIS
whirlies I-DIS
today O
I O
ve O
been O
wandering O
recently O
how O
much O
of O
an O
influence O
it O
has O
. O
I O
know O
caffeine O
from O
coffee O
triggers O
it O
although O
tea O
isn O
t O
so O
bad O
. O
Nicotine B-DRUG
seems O
to O
trigger O
it O
a O
bit O
but O
I O
ve O
been O
smoking O
for O
years O
and O
it O
only O
flared B-DIS
up I-DIS
just O
before O
Christmas O
. O
Stress O
is O
a O
big O
trigger O
obviously O
. O

Yep O
. O
She O
only O
needs O
it O
a O
few O
days O
a O
month O
, O
when O
things O
are O
bad- O
during O
off O
periods O
she O
is O
more O
prone O
to O
those O
than O
most O
, O
don O
t O
let O
it O
scare O
you O
too O
much O
. O
Luckily O
, O
Parkinson O
s O
is O
among O
the O
easiest O
of O
diseases O
to O
get O
on O
SSDI B-DRUG
for O
which O
is O
a O
VERY O
difficult O
thing O
to O
do O
, O
something O
like O
75 O
of O
all O
claims O
are O
denied O
the O
first O
time O
and O
from O
this O
lovely O
link O
it O
looks O
like O
Canada O
s O
disability O
pension O
is O
similar O
. O
I O
hope O
you O
don O
t O
have O
Parkinson O
s O
as O
well O
, O
but O
if O
you O
do O
, O
at O
least O
it O
won O
t O
be O
a O
struggle O
to O
get O
help O
. O
My O
Dad O
had O
another O
type O
of O
issue O
and O
flirted O
with O
homelessness O
a O
few O
times O
when O
we O
were O
trying O
to O
get O
him O
assistance O
, O
so O
this O
is O
a O
real O
blessing O
. O
My O
wife O
has O
a O
pretty O
good O
life O
. O
She O
has O
a O
more O
active O
social O
life O
than O
I O
do O
since O
when O
she O
s O
having O
a O
good O
day O
she O
can O
drive O
just O
fine O
still O
, O
and O
get O
into O
the O
nearest O
city O
for O
lunches O
and O
munches O
, O
plays O
a O
lot O
of O
video O
games O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
her O
passions O
even O
though O
we O
have O
specialty O
weighted O
controllers O
and O
adjust O
settings O
depending O
on O
how O
bad O
the O
hand B-DIS
tremors I-DIS
are O
, O
and O
like O
I O
mentioned O
, O
she O
s O
moved O
her O
focus O
from O
police O
work O
to O
being O
a O
science O
fiction O
and O
fantasy O
author O
. O
She O
s O
not O
making O
any O
money O
from O
it O
, O
but O
as O
a O
science O
fiction O
nerd O
, O
she O
wrote O
enough O
high O
quality O
fan O
fiction O
in O
the O
Star O
Wars O
universe O
that O
she O
was O
actually O
approached O
by O
Disney O
to O
write O
cannon- O
which O
is O
epic O
, O
and O
awesome O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
she O
gets O
over O
her O
fears O
of O
rejection O
and O
shyness O

, O
she O
has O
6 O
novels O
ready O
to O
go O
, O
and O
they O
re O
all O
quite O
good O
. O
So O
, O
while O
it O
does O
suck O
, O
I O
really O
mean O
it O
when O
i O
say O
it O
does O
not O
mean O
that O
your O
life O
is O
over O
. O
It O
just O
means O
that O
your O
life O
changes O
, O
and O
that O
was O
going O
to O
happen O
anyway O
, O
ya O
know O
It O
s O
a O
curve O
ball O
, O
but O
one O
you O
can O
handle O
. O
Frankly O
it O
s O
easier O
than O
a O
lot O
of O
the O
curve O
balls O
my O
friends O
have O
been O
handed- O
I O
would O
say O
a O
young O
onset O
diagnosis O
is O
1,000 O
times O
easier O
than O
a O
special O
needs O
child O
, O
and O
while O
it O
can O
change O
your O
life O
it O
s O
not O
going O
to O
significantly O
shorten O
your O
life O
expectancy O
like O
a O
lot O
of O
other O
things O
. O
I O
ll O
keep O
my O
fingers O
crossed O
for O
you O

Would O
you O
say O
more O
HHAs O
from O

are O
like O
that O

The O
effects O
of O
menieres B-DIS
seem O
to O
be O
different O
for O
everyone O
. O
ranging O
from O
severity O
of O
symptoms O
to O
how O
long O
they O
can O
last O
etc O
. O
mine O
started O
at O
26 O
, O
and O
they O
were O
brutal O
. O
I O
didn O
t O
know O
what O
was O
happening O
and O
no O
doctors O
mentioned O
it O
to O
me O
. O
I O
d O
usually O
end O
up O
in O
hospital O
on O
a O
drip O
for O
24 O
hours O
then O
sent O
home O
with O
no O
follow O
up O
from O
them O
or O
me O
. O
for O
months O
they O
would O
be O
almost O
every O
7 O
to O
10 O
days O
lasting O
up O
to O
a O
week O
. O
the O
sickness B-DIS
would O
last O
at O
least O
48 O
hours O
. O
then O
about O
a O
year O
in O
a O
became O
pregnant B-DIS
and O
they O
just O
stopped O

I O
thought O
that O

when O
my O

was O
3 O
I O
had O
one O
just O
out O
of O
the O
blue O

no O
warning O
or O
anything O
. O
they O
carried O
on O
for O
months O
, O
then O
would O
go O
away O
for O
as O
few O
months O
. O
every O
time O
they O
started O
up O
again O
they O
would O
of O
changed O
pattern O
. O
I O
was O
no O
longer O
as O
sick O
usually O
just O
a O
few O
hours O
but O
the O
dizziness B-DIS
was O
bad O
so O
apart O
from O
stay O
in O
bed O
they O
was O
nothing O
I O
could O
do O
. O
3 O
years O
ago O
I O
had O
a O
attack B-DIS
and O
my O
hearing B-DIS
in I-DIS
my I-DIS

things O

Also O
, O
being O
open O

I O

it O

good O
game O
for O
lengthy O

in O
El O

Yes O
, O
I O
was O
just O
turning O
18 O
at O
the O
time O
and O
had O
Multiple B-DIS
stones? I-DIS
. O
My O
largest O
was O
just O
at O
the O
threshold O
size O
of O
being O
just O
barely O
able O
to O
be O
passed O
. O
They O
kept O
me O
in O
the O
hospital O
drugged O
up O
due O
to O
the O
Extreme B-DIS
pain. I-DIS
. O
I O
was O
completely O
out O
of O
it O
but O
apparently O
still O
in O
pain O
according O
to O
my O
mother O
. O
Every O
time O
I O
peed O
, O
I O
Due B-DIS
to I-DIS
the I-DIS
blood, I-DIS
I I-DIS
pissed I-DIS
a I-DIS
little I-DIS
red. I-DIS
. O
This O
lasted O
for O
about O
a O
week O
after O
I O
had O
the O
procedures O
. O
I O
don O
t O
remember O
much O
of O
it O
as O
I O
was O
in O
a O
complete O
haze O
the O
entire O
time O
. O
If O
it O
doesn O
t O
hurt O
when O
you O
pee O
it O
most O
likely O
means O
the O
Stone B-DIS
: I-DIS
is O
not O
lodged O
in O
. O
That O
is O
a O
good O
sign O
. O
This O
sounds O
more O
like O
the O
second O
and O
third O
time O
I O
had O
Stones. B-DIS
which O
were O
much O
smaller O
. O
The O
second O
stone O
passed O
in O
2 O
days O
while O
the O
3rd O
passed O
while O
I O
was O
still O
in O
the O
ER O
. O
Keep O
drinking O
as O
much O
as O
you O
can O
and O
hopefully O
you O
can O
flush O
it O
right O
through O
. O

your O

when O
I O
say O

I O
don O

mean O
reconciliation O

. O
I O
mean O
forgiveness O
that O
we O
feel O
in O
our O
hearts O
, O
where O
we O
are O
able O
to O
release O
ourselves O
from O
the O
stubborn O
energy O
formed O
by O
resentment O
. O
Non-forgiveness O
choosing O
who O
gets O
it O
and O
who O
doesn O
t O
gives O
us O
an O
illusion O
of O
control O
that O
our O
egos O
desperately O
cling O
onto O
. O
It O
also O
keeps O
us O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
separate O
self O
, O
which O
is O
why O
so O
many O
Bpd B-DIS
sufferers O
feel O
separate O
and O
disconnected O
from O
others O
. O
I O
would O
never O
discount O
someone O
s O
story O
of O
victimization O
- O
indeed O
, O
people O
with O
Bpd B-DIS
have O
likely O
suffered O
more O
victimizing O
situations O
than O
most O
. O
But O
to O
me O
, O
spirituality O
has O
been O
about O
releasing O
the O
story O
of O
betrayal O
, O
wrongdoing O
, O
unfairness O
, O
etc O
and O
instead O
embracing O
something O
higher O
. O
If O
we O
only O
forgave O
people O
who O
deserve O
it O
, O
it O
d O
be O
easy O
as O
pie O
. O
For O
me O
, O
real O
healing O
began O
when O
I O
forgave O
the O
people O
who O
didn O
t O
feel O
remorse O
or O
guilt O
for O
what O
they O
d O
done O
. O
Of O
course O
the O
lessons O
remain O
, O
and O
I O
d O
never O
make O
contact O
with O
them O
. O
But O
my O
body O
no O
longer O
carries O
the O
The B-DIS
heaviness I-DIS

dread I-DIS
of I-DIS
trauma I-DIS
, O
because O
it O
is O
not O
mine O

to O

Thanks O
for O
your O
perspective O
- O
when O
I O
say O
forgiveness O
, O
I O
don O
t O
mean O
reconciliation O

contact O
. O
I O
mean O
forgiveness O
that O
we O
feel O
in O
our O
hearts O
, O
where O
we O
are O
able O
to O
release O
ourselves O
from O
the O
stubborn O
energy O
formed O
by O
resentment O
. O
Non-forgiveness O
choosing O
who O
gets O
it O
and O
who O
doesn O
t O
gives O
us O
an O
illusion O
of O
control O
that O
our O
egos O
desperately O
cling O
onto O
. O
It O
also O
keeps O
us O
in O
the O
idea O
of O
separate O
self O
, O
which O
is O
why O
so O
many O
sufferers O
feel O
separate O

Yeah O
I O
try O

because O
I O

she O
already O
has O
enough O
on O
her O

. O
To O
your O
situation O
she O
went O
through O
the O

scenario O
. O
Went O
to O
the O
hospital O
. O
Was O
on O
a O
Steroid. B-DRUG
for O
five O

So O
I O

when O
it O

the O
that O
whole O

. O
Well O
at O

the O
outsider O
looking O
in O
. O
I O
dont O
expect O
her O
to O
be O
treated O

because O
everyone O
has O
had O

what O
not O
. O
I O
just O
wish O

. O
When O
she O

I O
ll O
bet O
you O
re O
female O
. O
When O
progesterone O
increases O
there O
is O
an O
increased O
response O
to O
thyroid O
hormone O
. O
Progesterone O
opposes O
estrogen O
so O
there O
can O
be O
periods O
of O
brief O
remission O
corresponding O
to O
the O
menstrual O
cycle O
, O
and O
also O
there O
can O
be O
Periods B-DIS
of I-DIS
high I-DIS
cortisol I-DIS
that O
is O
commonly O
mistaken O
for O
Hyperthyroidism B-DIS
: I-DIS
, O
but O
is O
not O
, O
because O
thyroid O
hormone O
opposes O
cortisol O
. O
Tsh O
was O
standardized O
from O
a O
1950s O
test O
called O
protein-bound O
iodide O
, O
which O
defined O
the O
Hypothyroidism B-DIS
population O
as O
5 O
based O
on O
iodide O
. O
It O
was O
presumed O
to O
be O
accurate O
but O
was O
not O
, O
so O
tsh O
came O
to O
the O
market O
in O
the O
1970s O
, O
but O
tsh O
was O
standardized O
on O
protein-bound O
iodide O
. O
Both O
tests O
vastly O
underestinate O
the O
Hypothyroidism B-DIS
population O
, O
for O
example O
previous O
data O
, O
using O
capnometry O
, O
defined O
the O
american O
hypothyroid O
populationbas O
slightly O
over O
40 O
. O
Tsh O
varies O
between O
labs O
, O
it O
varies O
diurnally O
, O
it O
varies O
in O
response O
to O
things O
such O
as O
cortisol O
and O
Caffeine B-DRUG
, O
and O
that O
is O
why O
it O
is O
continually O

upwards O

downards O

for O

it O
was O
increased O

I O
m O
glad O
you O

something O
that O
is O
giving O
you O
some O
relief O

The B-DIS

can O
be O
hell O

Have O
you O
tried O
the O
low O
FODMAP O
diet O
before O
I O
found O
the O
best O
relief O
with O
following O
low O
FODMAP O
. O
It O
surprises O
me O
that O
meat O
has O
always O
caused O
Stiffen B-DIS
ups I-DIS
- I-DIS
for O
you O
- O
was O
it O
spiced O
with O
onion O
and O
or O
garlic O
or O
like O
a O
plain O
chicken O
breast O

curious O
. O
Did O
you O
see O
a O
dietician O
and O
a O
gastroenterologist O
as O
part O
of O
your O
The B-DIS
ibs I-DIS
diagnosis O
and O
follow O
up O
care O
plan O
Western O
medicine O
is O
what O
has O
been O
helping O
me O
, O
because O
low O
FODMAP O
is O
based O
on O
continuing O
scientific O
research O
and O
testing O
of O
individual O
foods O
. O
It O
is O
upsetting O
to O
me O
that O
you O
were O
never O
given O
dietary O
advice O
from O
your O
care O
team O
in O
order O
to O
help O

First O
let O
me O
say O
I O
understand O
completely O
. O
Nobody O
wants O
to O
think O
practically O
and O
do O
the O
mature O
thing O
that O
will O
actually O
work O
. O
You O
re O
hurt O
and O
you O
want O
to O
be O
loved O
. O
Somebody O
is O
trying O
to O
be O
there O
for O
you O
. O
You O
can O
mess O
with O
him O
and O
put O
him O
through O
a O
ton O
of O
shit O
and O
it O
could O
drag O
on O
for O
like O
two O
years O
that O
way O
, O
but O
if O
he O
s O
not O
prone O
to O
codependency O
he O
will O
leave O
, O
no O
matter O
how O
much O
he O
loves O
all O
the O
other O
things O
about O
you O
. O
You O
will O
do O
and O
say O
ugly O
things O
to O
him O
and O
you O
will O
regret O
it O
later O
. O
I O
promise O
. O
You O
know O
this O
is O
true O
. O
I O
want O
everyone O
to O
have O
to O
feel O
my O
pain O
too O
but O
don O
t O
hurt O
the O
man O
who O
loves O
you O
, O
it O
will O
only O
lessen O
your O
pain O
temporarily O
. O

a O
pretty O
good O
life O
. O
She O
has O
a O
more O
active O
social O
life O
than O

do O
since O
when O
she O
s O
having O
a O
good O
day O
she O
can O
drive O
just O
fine O
still O
, O
and O
get O
into O
the O
nearest O
city O
for O
lunches O
and O
munches O
, O
plays O
a O
lot O
of O
video O
games O
, O
which O
is O
one O
of O
her O
passions O
even O
though O
we O
have O
specialty O
weighted O
controllers O
and O
adjust O
settings O
depending O
on O
how O
bad O
the O
are O
, O
and O
like O
I O
mentioned O
, O
she O
s O
moved O
her O
focus O
from O
police O
work O
to O
being O
a O
science O
fiction O
and O
fantasy O
author O
. O
She O
s O
not O
making O
any O
money O
from O
it O
, O
but O
as O
a O
science O
fiction O
nerd O
, O
she O
wrote O
enough O
high O
quality O
fan O
fiction O
in O
the O
Star O
Wars O
universe O
that O
she O
was O
actually O
approached O
by O
Disney O
to O
write O
cannon- O
which O
is O
epic O
, O
and O
awesome O
. O
As O
soon O
as O
she O
gets O
over O
her O
fears O
of O
rejection O
and O
shyness O

Wow O
thanks O
for O
the O
response O
I O
had O
the O
exact O
same O
experience O
. O
Trying O
to O
work O
out O
when O
I O
was O
a O
skinny O
15 O
year O
old O
kid O
, O
not O
understanding O
why O
I O
would O
get O
sick O
every O
time O
I O
tried O
exercising O
when O
I O
had O
done O
sports O
4-5 O
times O
a O
week O
just O
a O
few O
years O
earlier O
. O
When O
I O
got O
sick O
the O
internet O
was O
around O
and O
there O
was O
probably O
ample O
information O
around O
, O
but O
the O
gradual O
onset O
made O
it O
much O
harder O
for O
doctors O
my O
own O
family O
and O
even O
for O
myself O
to O
take O
the O
illness O
serious O
. O
At O
which O
age O
did O
you O
get O
ill O
Also O
at O
what O
speed O
has O
your O
illness O
progressed O
And O
are O
you O
still O
constantly O
getting O
worse O
I O
am O
kinda O
worried O
I O
will O
be O
close O
to O
bedbound O
in O
10 O
years O
time O
, O
especially O
because O
I O
already O
spend O
around O
16 O
hours O
a O
day O
in O
bed O
on O
the O
couch O
at O

adjust O
the O

per O
my O
Doc O

My O
Medtronic O
representative O
they O
are O
there O
during O

a O

the O

they O
changed O
her O

Sadly O
the O

They O
have O
no O

what O
you O

you O
are O
a O
fully O
